The company said it made more money in the latest quarter compared with last year — a lot more money.</p><p>The company said sales in the three months ending in June hit $113.1 billion, up 27 percent from a year earlier, when lockdowns were at their most extreme. It made $7.8 billion in profit, up 48 percent from $5.2 billion a year ago.</p><p>The results were a sign that even as businesses have reopened after the height of the pandemic, many people continue to do their shopping online, and much of that business continues to go Amazon’s way. The other biggest tech companies — Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft — have also reported blockbuster results this week.</p><p>But Brian Olsavsky,<strong> </strong>the company’s finance chief, said in a call with reporters that online sales growth had slowed some because more people were shopping more in person and spending time vacationing or socializing. “That’s all good,” he said, “but that does tend to lead them do other things besides shop.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Shares of Amazon’s stock were down more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading, as investors had expected sales to be even higher and the outlook for the next quarter to be rosier. Amazon is valued at about $1.8 trillion, more than twice its value before the pandemic.</p><p>Amazon’s profit beat investor expectations as its most profitable businesses continued to flourish. Its cloud-computing division is now larger than most companies — Morgan Stanley estimates it is worth $600 billion — and growth continues to be strong. Sales in cloud computing rose 37 percent, to $14.8 billion. Its “other” business segment, which is primarily its advertising business, grew 87 percent to $7.9 billion. And within its consumer business, Amazon’s revenue from fees it charges marketplace sellers totaled $25 billion.</p><p>Subscriptions, largely Prime memberships, brought in $7.9 billion. About 200 million people are now Prime members, and a recent analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found they shop at Amazon 27 times a year on average, almost twice as frequently as customers who are not Prime members.</p><p>Amid a building boom to expand its fulfillment and delivery network, the company added another 64,000 workers in the past three months and now employs more than 1.3 million people — 52 percent more than this time last year. In the competitive labor market, Amazon has raised wages, which Mr. Olsavsky called “one of the bigger elements of inflation in our business right now.” He said the company expected to open many new facilities in the coming months as it heads into the holiday shopping season.</p><p>Comparing Amazon’s performance with last year’s is somewhat challenging this quarter. Last year, the company had an enormous surge in sales after it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html" title="">adjusted its staffing</a> and other parts of its business to better meet the pandemic-fueled demand. But also this year, Amazon’s Prime Day deals event fell in June instead of October, giving another boost to revenue this quarter. J.P. Morgan estimated this year’s event generated about $8.4 billion in sales. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT" title=""><em>sign up here</em></a><em> to receive it weekdays.</em></p><p>I’m angry about start-up founders who over-promise, behave badly and sometimes crater their companies and walk away unscathed.</p><p>But deep down, I also wonder whether unscrupulous, boundary-pushing executives are an inescapable part of innovation — rather than an aberration.</p><p>If we want world-changing technology, are hucksters part of the deal? This is a version of a question that I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/george-floyd-protests-twitter.html" title="">wrestle with</a> about technologies including Facebook and Uber: Is the best of what technology can do inextricably linked to all the horribles?</p><p>I’ve been thinking about this recently because of the glare on two start-up founders, Adam Neumann and Trevor Milton.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Neumann used to be the chief executive of the office rental start-up WeWork. He boasted that his company would transform the nature of work (on Earth <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023917646/the-rise-and-fall-of-wework" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and Mars</a>), forge new bonds of social cohesion and make boatloads of money. WeWork has done none of those things.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/books/review/the-cult-of-we-eliot-brown-maureen-farrell.html" title="">new book</a> details the ways that WeWork mostly just rented cubicles, burned through piles of other people’s money, treated employees like garbage and made Neumann stinking rich as the company nearly collapsed in 2019. WeWork has stuck around in less outlandish form without Neumann.</p><p>And last week, federal authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/nikola-trevor-milton-fraud.html" title="">charged</a> Milton with duping investors in his electric truck start-up Nikola into believing that the company’s battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicle technology was far more capable than it really was. Among the allegations are that Milton ordered the doctoring of a promotional video to make a Nikola prototype truck appear to be fully functional when it was not. (Milton’s legal team has said that the government was seeking to “criminalize lawful business conduct.”)</p><p>It’s easy to shake your head at these people and others — including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-patients-the-emerging-wild-card-in-the-trial-of-elizabeth-holmes-11627915111?mod=hp_lead_pos5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes</a> who will soon be on trial for fraud — and wonder what personal failures led them to mislead, hype, and crash and burn.</p><p>But people like Holmes, Neumann and Milton are not oopsies. They are the extreme outcomes of a start-up system that rewards people who have the biggest and most outrageous ideas possible, even if they have to fudge a little (or a lot).</p></div></div><div><div><p>I am constantly furious about this system that seems to force start-ups to shoot for the moon, or else. WeWork had a basically smart, if not entirely original, idea to remove many of the headaches of commercial office leasing. But that wasn’t enough, and I almost don’t blame Neumann for that.</p><p>Disproportionate rewards go to the entrepreneurs and companies that can sell a vision of billions of users and values in the trillions of dollars. This is why Airbnb doesn’t merely say that it lets people rent a home in an app. The company says that Airbnb helps “<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people satisfy a fundamental human need for connection</a>.” It’s why delivery companies like Uber and DoorDash are aiming to deliver any possible physical product to anyone, and companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/technology/virtual-reality.html" title="">﻿think they have to make virtual reality</a> become as popular as smartphones. Merely earthbound ambitions aren’t good enough.</p><p>Those conditions tempt people to skirt the edges of what’s right and legal. But I also wonder if curtailing the excesses would also curb the ambition that we want. Sometimes the zeal to imagine ridiculously grand visions of the future brings us Theranos. And sometimes it brings us Google. Are these two sides of the same coin?</p><p>Elon Musk shows both the good and the bad of what happens when technologists dream outlandishly big. Perhaps more than any single person, Musk has made it possible for automakers, governments and all of us to imagine electric cars replacing conventional ones. This is a potentially planet-transforming change.</p><p>But Musk has also endangered people’s lives by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/opinion/self-driving-cars-tesla-elon-musk.html" title="">overhyping driver-assistance technology</a>, has repeatedly over-promised technology that hasn’t panned out and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/business/tesla-musk-sec-settlement.html" title="">has skirted both the law</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/elon-musk-cant-lose" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human decency</a>.</p><p>I used to half-jokingly ask a former colleague: Why can’t Musk just make cars? But maybe it’s impossible to separate the reckless carnival barker who deludes himself and others from the bold ideas that really are helping to change the world for the better.</p><p>I hate thinking this. I want to believe that technologies can succeed without aiming to reprogram all of humanity and without the associated temptations to engage in fraud or abuse. I want the good Musk without the bad. I want the wonderful and empowering elements of social media without <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" title="">the genocide</a>. But I just don’t know if we can separate the wonderful from the awful.</p></div></div><div><div><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>The next target of China’s tech crackdown? </strong>The authorities showed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/technology/china-video-game-tencent.html" title="">they may be unhappy with video game companies</a>, my colleague Cao Li reported, and stock prices crashed for some big Chinese game makers.

Redoing the competition would most likely have taken months.</p></div></div><div><div><p>NASA officials can now decide whether to take up Mr. Bezos on an offer he made in <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter to Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator</a>, on Monday: to effectively slice $2 billion off the $6 billion proposal from Blue Origin, which collaborated with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.</p><p>When the competition was announced, NASA officials said they wanted more than one design to ensure both competition and redundancy in case one of the companies stumbled.</p><p>But in April, NASA announced that it was awarding just one contract, to SpaceX. The company will use the money for the development of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/science/spacex-starship-launch.html" title="">Starship, the large reusable spacecraft</a> the company is developing in South Texas, that is central to Mr. Musk’s ambitions of one day sending people to Mars.</p><p>Space agency officials suggested then that they were hemmed in by limited budgets. Congress had provided $850 million in the current fiscal year for the project, one-fourth of what the Trump administration had asked for in its final budget request.</p><p>Both Blue Origin and Dynetics protested the award to the Government Accountability Office, which can review federal contract decisions. The G.A.O. said NASA did not violate any of its rules by making just one award — the announcement of the competition said the space agency reserved the right to make just one award — or none at all.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The G.A.O. also said that NASA had fairly evaluated the three proposals, and although it agreed that NASA had improperly waived one requirement for SpaceX, that mistake was not serious enough to merit redoing the competition.</p><p>“Despite this finding, the decision also concludes that the protesters could not establish any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice arising from this limited discrepancy in the evaluation,” <a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the G.A.O. said in a statement</a>.</p><p>The award to SpaceX is just for the first moon landing, scheduled for 2024, although few expect it will occur that soon. “Importantly, the G.A.O.’s decision will allow NASA and SpaceX to establish a timeline for the first crewed landing on the moon in more than 50 years,” NASA said in a statement.</p><p>NASA officials have said they would have another moon lander competition open to Blue Origin, Dynetics and any other company.</p><p>In his letter, Mr. Bezos said NASA should choose now to ensure competition. “Competition will prevent any single source from having insurmountable leverage over NASA,” he wrote.</p><p>After the decision, Blue Origin said in a statement: “We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the G.A.O. wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction. We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution.”</p><p>In an effort to prod NASA into reopening the competition, the chairwoman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, where Blue Origin is headquartered, added a bipartisan provision requiring the agency to pick a second contractor into a sprawling research and technology bill that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/us/politics/china-bill-passes.html" title="">overwhelmingly passed the Senate in June</a>. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, chafed at the measure, claiming that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/24/us/joe-biden-news-today#sanders-proposes-strict-conditions-for-semiconductor-companies-that-receive-federal-funds" title="">amounted to a “bailout”</a> for Mr. Bezos’ company. But powerful senators on the Commerce Committee backed it, arguing that NASA had always intended to give out two awards.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“The American taxpayers invest too much in these space programs not to apply these lessons about the importance of resiliency and redundancy,” Ms. Cantwell said in a May speech from the Senate floor. “The same lesson should be applied to the programs developed here as we approach this new project to land people back on the moon.”</p><p>But that legislation has since stalled in the House, despite a call from President Biden to send the bill to his desk. And while House-led committees have passed a series of piecemeal bills intended to counter the Senate-passed legislation, lawmakers have yet to approve similar measures relating to NASA, frustrating proponents of the lunar lander provision and leaving the fate of the bill uncertain.</p><p>In turning to private companies to help undertake its moon program, known as Artemis, NASA hopes to recreate successes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/science/space-station-reality-tv-movies.html" title="">outsourcing transportation of cargo and now astronauts to the International Space Station</a>. In the past, NASA designed and operated its own spacecraft, but that approach was more expensive.</p><p>Because this was not a typical federal contract competition where companies vie for one set task, Mr. Bezos and Blue Origin officials say NASA is still free to make additional awards if it so wished. By waiving its fee for the next two fiscal years, up to $2 billion, Mr. Bezos said that adjustment addressed NASA’s financing constraints.</p><p>The current bids by Blue Origin and Dynetics remain valid until Aug. 9. A Blue Origin spokesman said the company has requested that NASA extend that deadline to Nov. 1 “to ensure NASA has every chance to award a second provider and restore competition.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company’s role in facilitating stock trades, its mission to upend Wall Street and its string of recent controversies have made it a symbol of Silicon Valley disruption and the challenges that come with it.

      <title>Can Paramount+ Succeed? One Producer Hopes to Make It So.</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Like so many other writer-directors, Alex Kurtzman grew up worshiping film.</p><p>But he is adaptable — and in the streaming era, that is a very lucrative trait.</p><p>Mr. Kurtzman, the onetime writer of the “Transformers” movies and the director of the 2017 film “The Mummy,”<span>  </span>recently renegotiated his deal at CBS Studios into one of the richest there. Under the $160 million, five-and-a-half-year agreement, he will continue to shepherd the growing “Star Trek” television universe for ViacomCBS’s Paramount+ streaming platform.</p><p>He will also create shows, including a limited series based on “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” which he will direct for Showtime, and the long-awaited adaptation of Michael Chabon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay.” That limited series is likely to be sold to an outside streaming service.</p><p>Mr. Kurtzman’s deal is the latest in a string intended to give prolific producers, like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy for Netflix and Jordan Peele with Amazon Studios, free rein to create content that can feed insatiable consumer appetites and hopefully boost subscriptions for streaming. This one puts the ambitions of CBS Studios — the production arm for the networks and channels under the ViacomCBS umbrella — squarely in the hands of the 47-year-old Mr. Kurtzman.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“From the first meeting I had with Alex, it was so obvious to me that he’s our future,” George Cheeks, the president and chief executive of CBS, said in an interview. “The guy can develop for broadcast. He can develop for premium streaming, broad streaming. He understands the business. He’s got tremendous empathy. He’s creatively nimble.</p><p>“When you make these investments,” Mr. Cheeks continued, “you need to know that this talent can actually deliver multiple projects at the same time across multiple platforms.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/business/01ALTkurtzman1-print/merlin_166803144_f76397dd-bdd6-4441-9c72-ac71a43821ad-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/business/01ALTkurtzman1-print/merlin_166803144_f76397dd-bdd6-4441-9c72-ac71a43821ad-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/business/01ALTkurtzman1-print/merlin_166803144_f76397dd-bdd6-4441-9c72-ac71a43821ad-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">“Star Trek: Discovery” is one of five “Star Trek” shows that Mr. Kurtzman has produced.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Michael Gibson/CBS</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The road ahead won’t be easy for ViacomCBS. Its fledgling Paramount+ was a late entry into streaming, and is essentially a rebranded and expanded version of CBS All Access. The company promotes the service’s news and live sports, including National Football League games, along with “a mountain of movies.” (“A Quiet Place 2” debuted on it on July 13.) But Paramount+, in combination with a smaller Showtime streaming offering, had just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/business/media/viacomcbs-earnings-paramount-streaming-viac.html" title="">36 million subscribers as of May</a>.</p><p>While it hopes to reach 65 million to 75 million global subscribers by 2024, that’s still a far cry from Netflix’s worldwide total of almost 210 million and the nearly 104 million for Disney+. Even NBCUniversal announced on Thursday that it had 54 million sign-ups for its Peacock streaming service, thanks to an Olympic push.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And with consolidation mania consuming Hollywood, many analysts are not confident that ViacomCBS will be able to continue to compete with the larger companies on its own.</p><p>“I think it’s hard to imagine any of these companies going it alone; I think they are all too small,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. “The challenge, whether it’s Peacock, Paramount+, Disney+ or Hulu, is that all of these companies are still conflicted over what do they put on linear TV, what do they put in a movie theater and what do they put on streaming.</p><p>“Netflix, Amazon and Apple do not have that debate every day,” he added. “All their assets go into one thing. Here, they have to balance, and that makes all of their streaming services suboptimal.”</p><p>Those corporate considerations don’t seem to bother Mr. Kurtzman. Rather than bemoaning the diminished state of movies or anguishing over the lack of viable buyers as the market shrinks, he said he was finding the current climate to be creatively invigorating and remarkably fluid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mr. Kurtzman said he wanted to make the “Star Trek” universe as expansive as the Marvel universe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“I do believe that the line between movies and television is gone now, and that to me is a tremendous opportunity,” he said in an interview. “For me and for showrunners like me, we can tell stories in a new way. We are not limited by the narrow definition of how you tell a story — something must be told in 10 hours, or something must be told in two hours.”</p><p>Mr. Kurtzman began working with CBS in 2009 when he developed the reboot of “Hawaii Five-0” with his former writing partner, Roberto Orci. In 2017, he began reimagining the “Star Trek” universe for the company, building on his familiarity with the franchise after co-writing the two J.J. Abrams-directed “Star Trek” movies several years earlier.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Since then, he has produced five shows in the universe initially imagined in the 1960s by Gene Roddenberry, and all will be on Paramount+. They are “Star Trek: Discovery”; “Star Trek: Picard”; “Star Trek: Lower Decks”; “Star Trek: Prodigy,” which will debut in the fall; and “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,” set for release in 2022. ViacomCBS says “Star Trek: Discovery” and “Star Trek: Picard” are among the most watched original series on Paramount+.</p><p>Also in the works are “Section 31,” starring Michelle Yeoh, and a show built around the “Starfleet Academy,” which will be aimed at a younger audience.</p><p>But how much “Star Trek” does one planet need?</p><p>“I think we’re just getting started,” Mr. Kurtzman said. “There’s just so much more to be had.”</p><p>He recently finished a four-month shoot in London for the first half of “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” a 10-episode series based on the 1976 David Bowie film. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a new alien character who arrives on Earth at a turning point in human evolution.</p><p>Mr. Kurtzman said he loved the experience of working on the series, buoyed by the fact that the pandemic allowed him and his writing partner, Jenny Lumet, the opportunity to complete all the episodes before production began.</p><p>“I would absolutely not be doing anything differently if we were making this as a film,” he said. “I’m working with movie stars in three different countries, shooting sequences that are certainly not typical television sequences, all of which I can only do because of my experience working in films.”</p><p>Ms. Lumet met Mr. Kurtzman in 2015. He requested getting together after seeing the film “Rachel Getting Married,” which she wrote. Ms. Lumet said she was surprised that this “sci-fi robot guy in khakis” was interested in meeting her at all.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“All he wanted to do was talk about tiny moments, tiny real moments in movies and tiny moments in television shows, and he was so gentle and willing to listen,” she said. “Usually, the robot guys aren’t willing to listen to anything, and that’s all he wanted to do. It was really cool.”</p><p>The two have worked on everything from “Star Trek: Discovery” and “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” to the short-lived “Clarice” and “The Man Who Fell to Earth.” Next, they plan to tackle the story of Ms. Lumet’s grandmother Lena Horne in a limited series for Showtime.</p><p>Those around Mr. Kurtzman credit his early experience in television (“Alias,” “Fringe,” “Sleepy Hollow”) for giving him the ability to manage multiple projects at one time without appearing to be overwhelmed.<span>  </span>“He has an almost supernatural ability to keep separate train tracks in his head, this show, this show and this show, and he can jump from one to the other,” Ms. Lumet said. “He is one of the few people who can keep all the trains running.”</p><p>His work as a film screenwriter began on Michael Bay’s 2005 film, “The Island.” Soon, he and Mr. Orci were being called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2011/05/17/celebrity-100-11-roberto-orci-alex-kurtzman-films-secret-weapons.html?sh=7c8527567f68" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Hollywood’s secret weapons”</a> for their ability to crack scripts on lucrative existing properties that others couldn’t (like “Transformers”). That led him to consider “Star Trek” in the same expansive terms that Marvel Studios views its cinematic universe. It’s a strategy that CBS Studios thoroughly endorses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mr. Kurtzman wrote two “Star Trek” films with Roberto Orci, right. J.J. Abrams, middle, directed both.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, points to “Star Trek: Prodigy” as an example. The animated show, one of the first animated “Star Trek” shows geared at children, is set to debut in the fall on Paramount+ before moving to Nickelodeon.</p><p>“It obviously builds fans at a much younger generation, which helps with consumer products,” Mr. Stapf said. “But it’s also a smart way to look at building an entire universe.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>To Mr. Stapf, who has overseen CBS Studios since 2004, the “Marvelization” of “Star Trek” can mean many things.</p><p>“Anything goes, as long as it can fit into the ‘Star Trek’ ethos of inspiration, optimism and the general idea that humankind is good,” he said. “So comedy, adult animation, kids’ animation — you name the genre, and there’s probably a ‘Star Trek’ version of it.”</p><p>That’s good news to Mr. Kurtzman, who wants to get much weirder with the franchise, which will celebrate its 55th birthday this year. He points to a pitch from Graham Wagner (“Portlandia,” “Silicon Valley”), centered on the character Worf, that he calls “incredibly funny, poignant and touching.”</p><p>“If it were up to me only, I would be pushing the boundaries much further than I think most people would want,” he said. “I think we might get there. Marvel has actually proven that you can. But you have to build a certain foundation in order to get there and we’re still building our foundation.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>LOS ANGELES — Ellie Zeiler, 17, a TikTok creator with over 10 million followers, received an email in June from Village Marketing, an influencer marketing agency. It said it was reaching out on behalf of another party: the White House.</p><p>Would Ms. Zeiler, a high school senior who usually posts short fashion and lifestyle videos, be willing, the agency wondered, to participate in a White House-backed campaign encouraging her audience to get vaccinated against the coronavirus?</p><p>“There is a massive need to grow awareness within the 12-18 age range,” Village Marketing wrote to Ms. Zeiler’s business email. “We’re moving fast and have only a few available slots to fill, so please let us know ASAP.”</p><p>Ms. Zeiler quickly agreed, joining a broad, personality-driven campaign to confront an increasingly urgent challenge in the fight against the pandemic: vaccinating the youthful masses, who have the lowest inoculation rates of any eligible age group in the United States.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Fewer than half of all Americans age 18 to 39 are fully vaccinated, compared with more than two-thirds of those over 50, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/us/virus-unvaccinated-americans.html" title="">about 58 percent</a> of those age 12 through 17 have yet to receive a shot at all.</p><p>To reach these young people, the White House has enlisted an eclectic army of more than 50 Twitch streamers, YouTubers, TikTokers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/fashion/olivia-rodrigo-white-house-suit.html" title="">the 18-year-old pop star Olivia Rodrigo</a>, all of them with enormous online audiences. State and local governments have begun similar campaigns, in some cases paying “local micro influencers” — those with 5,000 to 100,000 followers — up to $1,000 a month to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEVRP-0o0y_EEQ7H1Hc2n3SsmhlxVulD/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promote Covid-19 vaccines</a> to their fans.</p><p>The efforts are in part a counterattack against a rising tide of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/technology/joseph-mercola-coronavirus-misinformation-online.html" title="">vaccine misinformation</a> that has flooded the internet, where anti-vaccine activists can be so vociferous that some young creators say they have chosen to remain silent on vaccines to avoid a politicized backlash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/30/business/00vaccine-influencers4/merlin_192092613_ff82b420-487f-44a8-95cb-91c84b0e1f00-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/30/business/00vaccine-influencers4/merlin_192092613_ff82b420-487f-44a8-95cb-91c84b0e1f00-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/30/business/00vaccine-influencers4/merlin_192092613_ff82b420-487f-44a8-95cb-91c84b0e1f00-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">“I didn’t worry about the backlash,” said Christina Najjar, 30, a TikTok star known online as Tinx.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Alyson Aliano for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“The anti-vaccine side of the internet is still set on all this vaccine news,” said Samir Mezrahi, the administrator of several “meme pages” such as Kale Salad, which has nearly 4 million followers on Instagram and posts viral videos and other content. “We’re posting about J. Lo and Ben Affleck.”</p></div><div><div><p>Renee DiResta, a researcher who studies misinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said that while influencer campaigns can be useful, they may be no match for mass, organic online movements. She noted the contrast between creators who have been asked to spread pro-vaccine messaging versus vaccine skeptics, who have made it a personal mission to question the injections.</p><p>“That’s the asymmetric passion,” she said. “People who believe it’s going to hurt you are out there talking about it everyday. They’re driving hashtags and pushing content and doing everything they can do.”</p><p>But even if the influencer campaigns amount to a sprinkler in a wildfire, some creators said, they felt compelled to join in.</p><p>“I didn’t worry about the backlash,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/style/tinx-tiktok.html" title="">Christina Najjar</a>, 30, a TikTok star known online as Tinx. “Helping spread the word about the importance of getting vaccinated was the right thing to do.”</p><p>Ms. Najjar said she was thrilled when the White House reached out to her through her manager in June. She soon posted a question-and-answer video about the vaccines with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Instagram.</p><p>Their banter was light. Discussing what she called a “happy vaxx girl summer,” Ms. Najjar peppered Dr. Fauci with questions: Was it safe to go out for a drink? Should we be concerned about getting pregnant after getting the vaccine? Do I look 26? “You have an ageless look to you,” he replied.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I’ll tell my Botox doctor that,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Najjar called the session “a great time,” adding, “I think I flirted with Dr. Fauci, but in a respectful way.” A White House official said Dr. Fauci was not available for comment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Public health officials have used celebrities to reach people since <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-elvis-got-americans-to-accept-the-polio-vaccine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elvis Presley rolled up his sleeve</a> on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in 1956 to get the polio vaccine. These days, young people are more likely to trust the advice of their favorite content creator than a mainstream celebrity, according to a 2018 study by the marketing agency <a href="https://musefind.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MuseFind</a>.</p><p>As a result, “we need to get an influencer army to push the pro-vaccine message out there,” said Jason Harris, chief executive of the advertising agency Mekanism, which is an authority on influencer marketing. “That’s the only way we’re going to have loud enough voices on social to drown out all the misinfo that’s happening.”</p><p>The White House began considering the power of online creators in January, repurposing the influencer marketing tactics that Mr. Biden had used on the campaign trail toward promoting vaccinations, said Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy.</p><p>Mr. Flaherty said he and Clarke Humphrey, the White House’s Covid-19 digital director, teamed up with Village Marketing and Made to Save, a national campaign aimed at promoting access to coronavirus vaccines. In June, they hosted several off-the-record briefings over Zoom so online creators could ask questions about the vaccines and how they worked.</p><p>Since then, the Biden administration has rolled out influencer discussions with Dr. Fauci and brought Ms. Rodrigo to the White House, where she urged people to “actually get to a vaccination site.”</p><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The 18-year-old pop star Olivia Rodrigo was recently tapped by the White House to persuade the youthful masses to get vaccinated.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>White House, via Reuters</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>In March, the White House also orchestrated an Instagram Live chat between Dr. Fauci and Eugenio Derbez, a Mexican actor with over 16.6 million Instagram followers who had been openly doubtful of the vaccines. During their 37-minute <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMQOqwxDNy0/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a>, Mr. Derbez was upfront about his concerns.</p><p>“What if I get the vaccine, but it doesn’t protect me against the new variant?” he asked. Dr. Fauci acknowledged that the vaccines might not completely shield people from variants, but said, “It’s very, very good at protecting you from getting seriously ill.”</p><p>Mr. Flaherty said the whole point of the campaign was to be “a positive information effort.” </p><p>State and local governments have taken the same approach, though on a smaller scale and sometimes with financial incentives.</p><p>In February, Colorado awarded a contract worth up to $16.4 million to the Denver-based Idea Marketing, which includes a program to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXD0VUo4qpwd5IidjSmxLpx7mY0YXxk8/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pay creators</a> in the state $400 to $1,000 a month to promote the vaccines.</p><p>Jessica Bralish, the communications director at Colorado’s public health department, said influencers were being paid because “all too often, diverse communities are asked to reach out to their communities for free. And to be equitable, we know we must compensate people for their work.”</p><p>As part of the effort, influencers have showed off where on their arms they were injected, using emojis and selfies to punctuate the achievement. “I joined the Pfizer club,” Ashley Cummins, a fashion and style influencer in Boulder, Colo., recently announced in a smiling selfie while holding her vaccine card. She added a mask emoji and an applause emoji.</p><p>“Woohoo! This is so exciting!” one fan commented.</p><p>Posts by creators in the campaign carry a disclosure that reads “paid partnership with Colorado Dept. of Public Health and Environment.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Patricia Lepiani, president of Idea Marketing, said local micro influencers are in demand because they can seem more authentic than national social media stars. “Vaccination campaigns will only be effective if you know your community,” she said.</p><p>Colorado officials recently said the state has <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/24/colorado-has-2-months-to-use-350000-doses-of-stockpiled-covid-19-vaccine-before-they-expire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just two months left</a> to use 350,000 doses of stockpiled Covid-19 vaccines before they expire.</p><p>Other places, including New Jersey, Oklahoma City County and Guilford County, N.C., as well as cities like San Jose, Calif., have worked with the digital marketing agency XOMAD, which identifies local influencers who can help broadcast public health information about the vaccines.</p><p>Governments’ interest in the campaigns has spiked sharply in the past week, said Rob Perry, chief executive of XOMAD, as concerns have grown about the spread of the Delta variant of the virus. He added that “when large numbers of influencers post in the same time period, vaccination rates go up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Ms. Zeiler, who signed on to the White House-backed campaign, also had an online conversation with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci in June.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Maggie Shannon for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>For Ms. Zeiler, the TikTok star, things moved quickly after she signed on to the White House-backed vaccination campaign. In June, she held an online conversation with Dr. Fauci, using the time to squash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/technology/pfizer-vaccine-infertility-disinformation.html" title="">the false rumor that vaccines cause infertility</a>. It was a conspiracy theory that she had heard from friends and that she had seen videos of on her TikTok “For You” page.</p></div><div><div><p>“When I saw that I was like, OK, I need to ask him about it,” she said. “It was kind of sad to see him be like, no, that’s not true.”</p><p>Ms. Zeiler has since used her footage with Dr. Fauci for other platforms, including Instagram, and created original content for YouTube promoting the vaccines. In one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpc_tL11oLQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">47-second video</a>, she spoke directly into the camera, ticking through the reasons she had gotten vaccinated and why others should too. “Reason one,” she declared, was “you can go wherever you want.”</p><p>Ms. Zeiler said in an interview that her work was not done. “I know I won’t stop until all my followers are safe and vaccinated,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the article, Dr. Mercola inaccurately likened the vaccines to “gene therapy” and argued against their usefulness.</p><p>A month later, The Freedom’s Phoenix and The Atlanta Business Journal also published another article by Dr. Mercola. This time, he blamed the billionaire Bill Gates for the pandemic, claiming Mr. Gates had “shadow control” of the World Health Organization.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html" title="">Facebook</a> and other social platforms have in recent weeks attracted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html" title="">attention for vaccine misinformation</a>, as Covid cases surge from the infectious Delta variant and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html" title="">vaccination rates slow</a>. But The Freedom’s Phoenix and The Atlanta Business Journal are two small publications — along with dozens of radio and television stations, and podcasts aimed at local audiences — that have also become powerful conduits for anti-vaccine messaging, researchers said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Mercola and other superspreaders of anti-vaccine content, who have been listed by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate as the “<a href="https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Disinformation Dozen</a>,” have appeared in articles in local publications or as guests on local radio shows and podcasts, according to a review by The New York Times. Some of their articles are regularly published by small-town newspapers or they are quoted as experts, The Times found.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/business/anti-vaccine-ppp-loans.html" title="">Sherri Tenpenny</a>, an osteopathic physician and vaccine skeptic, was recently <a href="https://coachdavelive.video/v/3035" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Coach Dave Live</a>, a podcast in Ohio aimed at local audiences, misleadingly claiming that coronavirus vaccines disrupt people’s fertility. Christiane Northrup, a physician and anti-vaccine activist, showed up <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/tXQ9afzmUDW7/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the Lillian McDermott radio show</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/world/florida-covid-cases.html" title="">Florida</a> and inaccurately said the vaccines would “change human DNA.” Ty Bollinger, another vaccine skeptic, was featured on News4 WSMV Nashville, an NBC-affiliated station in Tennessee, where he discussed why people should not get vaccinated.</p><p>Their appearances on local media can have an impact since Americans are more likely to believe what they read and hear from local news outlets. A 2019 <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/reports/state-of-public-trust-in-local-news" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Knight-Gallup study</a> found that 45 percent of Americans trust reporting by local news organizations “a great deal” or “quite a lot,” compared with 31 percent for national news organizations.</p><p>“People think they are trusting their local news, something reliable and familiar, when in fact they are trusting misinformation,” said Rachel Moran, a fellow at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington. “It is a huge problem and growing.”</p><p>The Freedom’s Phoenix, The Atlanta Business Journal, Coach Dave Live, Lillian McDermott show and News4 WSMV did not return requests for comment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In an email, Dr. Mercola wrote, “Local communities must come together when the federal health agencies and mainstream media are under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry.”</p><p>Dr. Tenpenny sent links to several reports about the human reproductive system. Dr. Northrup and Mr. Bollinger didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Many local media publications and stations have reported responsibly and factually on the pandemic. Gannett, the publisher with 100 daily newspapers and nearly 1,000 weekly publications across 43 states, has dedicated resources to fact-checking and teaching journalists that accuracy matters more than speed, said Amalie Nash, senior vice president for local news and audience development at USA Today, which is owned by Gannett.</p><p>The investment was crucial because in the pandemic, “people turned to us in record numbers to get information about lockdowns, mask policies and vaccines,” Ms. Nash said.</p><p>But as the local news industry has been hit by declining advertising revenues and cuts, some outlets have sometimes unknowingly run vaccine misinformation because they have fewer employees or less oversight than in the past, said Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst. Without the resources to publish original, independent journalism, they may also rely on whatever can be freely repurposed from online material, he said.</p><p>In total, local media remains a significant force. There were 1,762 local television stations and 3,379 radio stations operating in the United States last year, according to the Radio Television Digital News Association and Syracuse University. While print publications have been decimated, there are still about 1,300 daily papers and 5,800 weekly publications, with roughly half located in small rural communities, according to <a href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> from the University of North Carolina.</p><p>Jo Lukito, an assistant journalism professor who studies disinformation at the University of Texas at Austin, said local media is often a starting point that creates a “trading up the chain” effect.</p></div></div><div><p>It starts when a rumor is covered or published in local media, she said, where it can gain a sheen of credibility. Then “when you pitch it to a Fox News or a larger news platform, you can say that this other outlet covered it, so it must be real,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">George Noory, host of the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM, in his studio in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ivan Kashinsky for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>One radio show that appears to have been part of that effect is Coast to Coast AM, which is syndicated on 640 local stations and reaches nearly three million weekly listeners. Its host, George Noory, has in recent years interviewed Dr. Tenpenny, Robert Kennedy Jr., a lawyer and anti-vaccine activist, and Erin Elizabeth, the founder of the website Health Nut News and a vaccine skeptic.</p><p>The activists have used their segments on the show to reinforce their messages. In a promotion for Dr. Tenpenny’s appearance to discuss the coronavirus in April 2020, for example, Coast to Coast AM’s website said, “She contends that there are so many unknowns in regards to testing, tracking, symptoms, and other factors, that the information we’re being told about the disease is meaningless.”</p><p>That line was shared on Dr. Tenpenny’s social media accounts and tweeted by some of her followers.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Noory said, “We give all views on my program and that includes people who are opposed to vaccines.”</p><p>Vaccine misinformation has also been published on sites that purport to be local news, but which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/technology/timpone-local-news-metric-media.html" title="">pay-for-play content</a> websites. These sites, where articles are ordered up and paid for by conservative think tanks, political operatives, corporate executives and public-relations professionals, have sprung up to fill the vacuum left by the loss of local publications.</p><p>Recent articles on some of those sites, such as Last Frontier News in Alaska and Bowling Green Today in Kentucky, highlighted people who died after receiving the Covid vaccines without saying that it was unclear if the vaccines were responsible, according to a review by The Times. The stories followed a pattern established on anti-vaccine blogs of pulling data from a national database of post-vaccine deaths without explaining the limitations of the data.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Last Frontier News and Bowling Green Today did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>At least one local radio host has recently recanted his anti-vaccine stance. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/world/phil-valentine-hospitalized-coronavirus.html" title="">Phil Valentine</a>, a conservative radio host in Tennessee, had declared <a href="http://philvalentineblog.blogspot.com/2020/12/the-vax-facts.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a blog post</a> in December that he would not get the vaccine because his chances of dying from the virus were “way less than one percent.”</p><p>But Mr. Valentine was diagnosed with Covid-19 in July and has been hospitalized in critical condition. He has since issued a statement advising others to get vaccinated.</p><p>“Phil would like for his listeners to know that while he has never been an ‘anti-vaxxer’ he regrets not being more vehemently ‘pro-vaccine’, and looks forward to being able to more vigorously advocate that position as soon as he is back on the air, which we all hope will be soon,” <a href="https://twitter.com/997wtn/status/1418543604159684614" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his station, 99.7 WTN, said</a> on July 23.</p></div></div><div><p>Last Wednesday, Mr. Valentine was put on a ventilator, <a href="https://twitter.com/997wtn/status/1420481609313263620" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">99.7 WTN</a> said. The station has added a hashtag to its posts about the host: #prayforphil.</p></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the absence of that, I also enjoy the company of comedians. Unfortunately, like tragically overbred dogs, comedians are high maintenance. It can be difficult to navigate their neediness because they are needy in such specific and unfixable ways. The audience may have laughed, but did they laugh enough? At the correct moments? Did the laughs compare favorably with the previous night’s? Or a fondly remembered night’s months ago? What about that one woman in the club who sat with her arms crossed? What was her problem? When I was a standup, there was an expression I heard too often from other comics, sometimes grumbled directly to an unresponsive audience: “That should have gotten more.”</p><p>And doesn’t anyone in search of a laugh have basically the same need, merely to a less grotesque and pathological degree? Thankfully, back in 2016, Apple was kind enough to create a democratic way for every person’s joke to get more, or at least enough: the “HA HA” Tapback. Apple’s Tapback feature allows users to smother an incoming text in iMessages with their finger until it coughs up a shortcut menu of cute little symbols, each mapped to some kind of basic emotional response. There’s a thumbs up or down, a heart, some exclamation points, a question mark — and a little “HA HA” bubble. </p><p>When the company introduced the feature, it was done with the appropriate amount of fanfare — which is to say, very little. Tapback, according to Apple, is a way to “quickly reply to messages with expressions,” but it’s often better suited for shutting down conversations altogether. Each is a variation on “Got it. We done here?”</p><blockquote><h2>The ‘HA HA’ Tapback’s special kind of magic is the way it meets your expectations as it lowers them.</h2></blockquote></div></div><div><div><p>That is where “HA HA” stands alone. This perfect little blue pill solves a problem that has always vexed my relationships with comedians or anyone trying to tell me a joke — a perceived unwillingness on my part to adequately “give it up.” It’s no exaggeration to say that this Tapback has saved many of my friendships.</p><p>I love comedy, but, to my great detriment, I react to jokes the same way my 6-year-old son appreciates his toys — by taking them apart and trying to figure out what makes them work. I’ve also never been an “LOL” person, especially over text. It’s uncomfortably performative, like typing “Ouch!” when you accidentally sit on your car keys. Though I have my own deep well of need tethered to every joke I attempt, it still makes me anxious when people use “LOL” too generously. Its motive feels questionable, like transactional flattery. When someone sends more than one “LOL” in a text thread, I can’t help thinking this person is about to ask me for a ride to the airport.</p><p>For a while I preferred a simple “Ha,” until I learned, through some negative feedback, to upgrade to the more emotive “Ha!” That felt like a commensurate response to a joke told over text, until the well became poisoned by that formless string of “HA”s. You’ve seen it, and you’ve probably done it: “HAHAHAHAHAHA.” Looks great on paper, feels great in a text thread, but it’s anarchic. Not only does it make the “Ha!” suddenly appear patronizing, it sets a terrible new standard, because there is no standard. How many “HA”s are enough? In any group thread, the “HA” string quickly leads to nightmare scenarios like this one:</p><blockquote><p>PERSON A: [JOKE!]</p><p>PERSON B: HAHAHA </p><p>[<em>A fine response; all is well.</em>]</p><p>PERSON C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA </p><p>[<em>Wow, I guess Person B hates jokes!</em>]</p></blockquote><p>When you’re improvising those “HA”s like jazz music, it becomes hard to track your work and easy to hurt feelings. Set the bar too high with a dozen or more, and, at any point in the future, even one fewer “HA” may suggest a curdling of your support.</p><p>That’s the joy of the “HA HA” Tapback’s neat, attractive uniformity: just a large “HA,” and one of diminished size beneath it, suggesting there’s probably no more where that came from. Gone are long, competing “HA” strings of varying lengths. Also gone are the overbearing “LOL” and the “streaming tears of laughter” emoji, which is, let’s face it, a bit much. The Tapback shifts the entire joke-grading system to “pass/fail,” and any professor tasked with grading that way knows more people are likely to pass — maybe even a few who don’t deserve to. The “HA HA” Tapback’s special kind of magic is the way it meets your expectations as it lowers them.</p><p>I once saw a comedian present his entire act to an audience that responded, perfectly appropriately, with a dense wall of silence. At one point, after yet another limp joke was received by nothing more than room tone, a member of the audience, possibly moved by the absurdity of it all, expelled a tickled snort. The comic onstage cocked his head slightly, like a cat hearing a can opener three rooms away, and said: “I heard a laugh. I’ll take it.” The “HA HA” Tapback streamlines a vast network of complicated and exhausting needs to just the one: <em>I saw a laugh. I’ll take it.</em></p></div></div><div><div><hr/><p>Todd Levin is an Emmy-nominated writer and comedian.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

Where is the testing bad? Where should we improve? Where should we invest our resources?”</p><p>To find answers, Dr. Rajashekharaiah used geospatial data, brandishing brightly colored maps that pinpointed the exact neighborhoods where cases were rising or where testing rates were lagging.</p><p>And after inoculations began, he started using digital mapping tools — commonly known as geographic information system, or G.I.S., software — to explore how vaccination rates varied across the county and how they correlated with a variety of demographic factors.</p></div></div><div><p>Several patterns soon emerged on the color-coded maps. In March, for instance, magenta splotches on the western side of the county made it clear that vaccination rates were low in neighborhoods with a high share of residents who did not speak English well. After he presented the map to his colleagues, they quickly added Spanish and Haitian Creole language assistance to their county vaccine hotline.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Maps produced by Suffolk County show vaccination rates in late March, left, and early June.

But, he added, “G.I.S. has been a very, very powerful tool for us to communicate these barriers.”</p><p>Amid the highly uneven rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, many health officials and community organizations are drawing upon geospatial data to plan their vaccination campaigns and track their progress in fine-grained detail.<strong> </strong>Esri, a California-based company that makes widely used G.I.S. software, says that hundreds of organizations around the world — including many U.S. states and more than 20 national governments — are using its digital mapping tools to help them get shots into arms.</p><p>“G.I.S. and mapping tools have been really important to helping these health departments get people vaccinated — to be more organized in the process, more streamlined and strategic and even tactical,” said Dr. Este Geraghty, the chief medical officer of Esri.</p></div></div><div><div><p>By allowing officials to quickly spot vaccine deserts, pinpoint high-risk populations and target their resources more efficiently, digital maps have become crucial tools in the effort to ensure that vaccination campaigns leave no neighborhood behind.</p><h2 id="link-5b69f5f5">Location, location, location</h2><p>As the virus raced across Wisconsin in the spring of 2020, officials in Milwaukee County became concerned about its unequal toll. In late March and early April, for instance, Black residents accounted for 69 percent of the Covid deaths in the county despite making up just 27 percent of its population, according to <a href="https://dc.uwm.edu/ced_pubs/54/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee report</a>.</p><p>These disparities were front of mind when the Covid-19 vaccines were finally authorized. “We wanted to make sure that we were equitably distributing this vaccine,” said David Crowley, the Milwaukee County executive.</p><p>They began categorizing census tracts according to their vaccination rates and their scores on a national “<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social vulnerability index</a>.” The index uses data on 15 different social, economic and demographic factors — including the age, minority status and education levels of residents, as well as local poverty and unemployment rates — to calculate how susceptible a given<strong> </strong>community would be in the event of some kind of disaster, like a hurricane or a pandemic.</p><p>Then the officials displayed the results online on <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/018eedbe075046779b8062b5fe1055bf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a color-coded map</a>. In mid-March, when the county first released it, much of the city of Milwaukee was colored dark orange, signaling that the area had high levels of social vulnerability but low vaccination rates.</p><p>On the other hand, the suburbs, where the population is wealthier and whiter, were shaded a pale yellow, indicating that they had low scores on the vulnerability index but climbing vaccination rates. “And so there was this story of the haves and have-nots, or two different cities,” said<strong> </strong>Dr. Ben Weston, who oversees the medical aspects of the county’s Covid-19 response.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Maps produced by Milwaukee County show vaccination rates in mid-March, left, and late July.

They also started a community ambassador program — the Crush Covid Crew — to train volunteers from those deep orange census tracts to talk to their neighbors about the vaccines and dispel misinformation about them.</p></div><div><div><p>Although vaccination rates in the most vulnerable areas still lag behind, they have more than tripled since mid-March. “The darkest orange communities are now gone,” Dr. Weston said. “So we’re making progress.”</p><h2 id="link-7bd07eb">Delivering doses</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A vaccine being prepared at the Grant Chapel A.M.E.

But instead of focusing on vaccination rates, it <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/southern.economic.advancement.project.seap./viz/GeorgiaVaccinationSitesDashboardFinal/Example1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mapped vaccination sites</a> across the state and then overlaid data on potential barriers to vaccination, including a lack of computer access and low rates of car ownership.</p><p>The map revealed numerous potential trouble spots, particularly in rural, southwest Georgia. “We saw this very large concentration of folks that had very limited vaccine access,” said Ali Bustamante, a senior research associate at the Southern Economic Advancement Project, which runs the initiative with the nonprofit organization Fair Count.<strong> </strong>“There were very few vaccination sites, while at the same time they were facing huge access constraints.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Southern Economic Advancement Project and Fair Count mapped vaccination sites in Georgia along with different types of demographic information.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>SEAP, via Tableau</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The groups partnered with vaccine providers to send mobile clinics to some of these vaccine deserts and began an all-out canvassing effort, borrowing the tools of a political campaign to encourage people to get shots. Volunteers ultimately made 79,000 phone calls, delivered vaccine information to 17,000 doors and helped book 4,500 vaccine appointments. “Particularly in rural areas, we have seen the vaccination gap close considerably,” Dr. Bustamante said.</p></div><div><p>Geospatial data is also critical for logistics. Carto, a cloud-based platform for analyzing geospatial data, has helped dozens of logistics companies around the world optimize their vaccine storage and transportation networks to get the shots distributed more quickly and efficiently, said Luis Sanz, the company’s chief executive.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A Carto map of Spain shows the optimal layout of vaccine distribution centers and delivery locations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Miguel Álvarez and Dan Rushton, Carto</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>And in Clackamas County in Oregon, G.I.S. data has become the backbone of efforts to vaccinate people who are homebound. “Because we are a large county with somewhat rural areas, we do have some transportation issues and access is a challenge for many of our residents,”<strong> </strong>said Kim La Croix, a public health program manager for the county. “Those mass vaccination sites were just not accessible to homebound seniors and homebound people with mental, developmental or physical disabilities.”</p><p>When residents call or email the county to request an at-home vaccination, staff members log their location, which pops up on a digital map. Then, when assigning specific appointment slots, they review the map, which displays the number and type of vaccines that have been requested across the county. The goal is to reduce nurses’ travel time, maximize the number of shots they give in a day and to minimize waste, by ensuring that the number of doses a nurse gives in a shift matches the number of doses in a vial<em>.</em></p><h2 id="link-7827a73f">Following directions</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Health officials examined a GRID3 map for Kuje, Nigeria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>GRID3</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In low and middle-income countries, basic geospatial data — about how many people need to be vaccinated and where they live — has been critical to the success of prior mass vaccination campaigns. About a decade ago, for instance, government officials and global health experts realized that polio vaccination teams in northern Nigeria <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/210/suppl_1/S102/2194326" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were using inaccurate, hand-drawn maps</a>.</p><p>“There were missing settlements, wrong settlement names,” said Emilie Schnarr, the Nigeria project manager for the Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development, or GRID3, program. “And that was one of the reasons children were being missed.”</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A hand-drawn map used by polio vaccination teams shows settlements, health care facilities, mosques and roads near Dundubus, Nigeria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Inuwa Barau et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Without reaching these children, the highly contagious polio virus was likely to continue circulating. So in the years that followed, the Nigerian government, in partnership with several global health organizations, used satellite imagery and local field teams to create detailed, high resolution maps, filling in missing buildings, settlements, and local points of interest.</p><p>The maps helped Nigeria eradicate polio, which the country <a href="https://grid3.org/news/outside-the-box-how-nigeria-won-the-fight-against-polio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finally achieved last year</a>. And GRID3, which grew out of these efforts, recently distributed updated maps to local officials across Nigeria, who are using them to help plan and track their Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A detail from a map of Kaltungo, Nigeria, shows estimated population density and distances to Covid-19 vaccination sites.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>National Primary Health Care Development Agency</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>They’re not alone. In March, five organizations that specialize in geographic data and information management — Alcis, CartONG, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, iMMAP and MapAction — joined forces to launch the Geographic Information Management Initiative for Covid-19 Vaccine Delivery. Their goal is to help 15 low-income countries, including Haiti, Sudan and Bangladesh, fill gaps in their geospatial data and then harness that information to get vaccines out to their residents.</p><p>The work, the say, will be of use not just for this pandemic, but for the delivery of all sorts of essential services, ensuring that local health authorities know where their citizens live and<strong> </strong>can<strong> </strong>help them meet their needs.</p><p>“To be on the map is to be acknowledged,” said Ivan Gayton, the senior humanitarian adviser to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. “Every community in the world should be able to put themselves on the map.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

That pressure has moved global investors to pull billions of dollars out of Chinese technology stocks, on fears that tighter regulation could hurt company prospects.</p><p>The Economic Information Daily article did not declare that any specific policy changes would be made, and it was unclear whether it reflected the views of Beijing officials or merely those of the publication’s editors.</p><p>Adding to the uncertainty, the link to the article went dead later on Tuesday, though a copy could <a href="http://news.xinhua08.com/a/20210803/1996101.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still be found</a> on the site of Xinhua, the official state news agency, which controls Economic Information Daily.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Despite the uncertainty, nervous investors were quick to sell shares.</p><p>Shares of Tencent, a technology conglomerate with a big presence in social media and entertainment in addition to video games, dropped about 10 percent at one point, though the losses later moderated and ended down about 7 percent. Shares of NetEase, another mainland video game company, fell nearly 9 percent.</p><p>The article’s headline — “A ‘spiritual opium’ has grown into an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars” — left little doubt at the thrust of the piece. It cited a litany of threats posed by video games, including diverting attention from school and family and causing nearsightedness.</p><p>“No industry or sport should develop at the price of destroying a generation,” it said.</p><p>The article singled out Tencent, which owns games popular in China like Honor of Kings as well as titles popular around the world, like League of Legends.</p><p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/65RUvnhl4HzOHhEk9Lgz4Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tencent</a> released a statement on Tuesday on its WeChat social media network describing some of the limits it recently decided to put into place, like limiting game time for minors and increasing efforts to ferret out those who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/china-honor-of-kings.html" title="">lie about their age</a> to play.</p><p>The scrutiny isn’t new to Tencent or the industry.

Many start-ups aim for this, but few have actually pulled it off. The company made stock trading as easy as playing Candy Crush. It made trades free, and it brought a lot of young people into stock investing. It forced other online brokers like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and E-Trade to change more than they had in years.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But in the same way that people are discussing the trade-offs of companies like Google and Facebook, people are also pointing out that Robinhood has created dangerous downsides.</p><p><strong>What are those downsides?</strong></p><p>Robinhood can feel to users more like a video game or a casino than an investment account, and that can sometimes compel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html" title="">inexperienced investors to take big risks</a>, especially when doing a type of trading that involves borrowing money. The investment managers Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/cnbc-transcript-billionaire-investors-warren-buffett-charlie-munger-sit-down-with-cnbcs-becky-quick-for-cnbcs-buffett-munger-a-wealth-of-wisdom-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> Robinhood, with Munger calling it “beneath contempt” and “a ​​sleazy, disreputable operation.”</p><p>Robinhood also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-08/someone-is-going-to-drill-the-oil?sref=Qk91czAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes more money when its users trade more,</a> but a lot of research has found that such behavior doesn’t generate the best investment returns. (The company’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial documents</a> say that a “vast majority” of its customers don’t fit the definition of “day traders” who do a lot of rapid-fire trades.)</p><p><strong>Professional investors can be reckless, too, and what they do sometimes is indistinguishable from gambling. Is the criticism of Robinhood just </strong><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-17/robinhood-is-opening-markets-not-disrupting-them?sref=Qk91czAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an elitist attitude</a></strong><strong> that most people can’t be trusted to invest their own money?</strong></p><p>That’s what Robinhood believes, as evidenced by a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ipo-public-stock-founder-letter-to-investors-2021-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defiant letter</a> that the company’s founder wrote to potential IPO investors. But people who follow the company have also asked whether Robinhood’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev.html" title="">zeal for growth and shaking up the system </a>has led to a pattern of serious errors.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>What kinds of errors?</strong></p><p>The app has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/technology/trading-app-robinhood-outage.html" title="">crashed at some crucial moments</a>. It recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html" title="">paid a record amount</a> to the securities industry’s self-regulatory body for that and other mistakes including not doing enough to screen out customers that weren’t suited for a type of higher-risk trading.</p><p>Last year, a young man killed himself <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance/?sh=436ac1c21638" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after a misunderstanding</a> that led him to believe that he was in the hole by more than $700,000 from Robinhood trades, and he couldn’t reach the company to sort it out. A traditional broker might not have allowed that type of investment without guidance, or it might have been easier for a customer to find help.</p><p><strong>You’ve written that we’re in </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/technology/fintech-startups-wall-street.html" title="">a golden age for new types of financial companies</a></strong><strong> including Robinhood, the payments start-up Stripe and semi-automated financial advisers. What’s going on?</strong></p><p>Many people have wanted something other than big, traditional financial institutions, but they didn’t have many good or reliable alternatives. When Simple, one of the first mobile banking companies, crashed all the time, the attitude nearly a decade ago was: This is what happens when your bank is just an app.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and now the technology building blocks for newer financial companies have become more solid, and trust in them is building among the public and regulators. It’s great for people to have more choices for banking and finance, but again there are trade-offs.</p><p>A number of these companies have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chime" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggled with repeated outages</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/coinbase-bitcoin-complaints.html" title="">frozen accounts</a>, hacks and other major issues. Conventional financial institutions have many problems, but they’re also not likely to lock you out of your money without recourse.</p></div></div><div><div><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Words fail to capture how rich these companies are. </strong>The combined profits of<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/apple-q3-earnings.html" title="">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/microsoft-q4-earnings.html" title="">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/alphabet-google-q2-earnings.html" title="">Google</a> for three months were four times Walmart’s profit for a whole year. Yeah, they’re rich.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kids use the internet. How do we keep them safe?</strong> Facebook’s Instagram <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/instagram-teenagers-privacy.html" title="">outlined new measures</a> to keep teenagers from unwelcome interactions with adults in the app, and it won’t allow advertising targeted to kids’ interests or online activity, my colleague Erin Woo reported. But as the company was touting its new protection measures, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-adds-more-protections-for-teenagers-11627390800?mod=hp_featst_pos4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> automated Instagram recommendations of horrifying sexualized hashtags and comments about children.</p></li><li><p><strong>Look, we NEED mindless TV: </strong>The HBO Max streaming video app has been glitchy, particularly on the Roku streaming gadget for TVs. Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/hbo-max-glitches-on-roku-frustrate-customers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke to frustrated customers</a>, some of whom have left 37 pages of HBO app gripes or workarounds on Roku’s website. (The root cause of all this is a streaming TV business model that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/technology/streaming-cable-tv.html" title="">replicated all of the old TV habits</a>.)</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1e910efa"><span>Hugs to this</span></h3><p>You gotta watch the TikTok star James “Bear” Bailey <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bearbailey1/video/6986818274503773445" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enchanting people at a convenience store</a> by singing the R&amp;B song “All My Life.” (Bailey regularly posts videos of himself singing in a gas station store near his home.)</p><hr/><p><em>We want to hear from you.

By midmorning, the shares had fallen somewhat and were up about 35 percent. It was a second day of sharp gains after jumping 24 percent on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/robinhood-stock.html" title="">Robinhood became a publicly traded company only last week</a>.

The lawsuit marked a sharp escalation in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/media/warner-bros-hbo-max-movies-pay.html" title="">festering standoff</a> between movie actors and media companies over compensation in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/business/media/wonder-woman-1984-hollywood-streaming.html" title="">streaming age</a>.</p><p>The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that Disney breached her contract when it released “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/movies/black-widow-review.html" title="">Black Widow</a>” simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ this month. Ms. Johansson’s suit said that Disney had promised that “Black Widow” would receive an exclusive release in theaters for approximately 90 to 120 days and that her compensation — based largely on bonuses tied to ticket sales — was gutted as a result of the hybrid release. Simultaneous availability on Disney+, where subscribers could watch the film instantly (and have permanent access to it) for a $30 surcharge, “dramatically decreased box office revenue,” Ms. Johansson said in the suit.</p><p>“There is no merit whatsoever to this filing,” Disney said in a statement.</p><p>Over its first three days in theaters, “Black Widow” collected $158 million at theaters worldwide and took in about $60 million on Disney+ Premier Access. Total ticket sales now stand at $327 million, the lowest total for a Marvel Studios release since 2008, when “The Incredible Hulk” collected $265 million (or $341 million in today’s dollars). Disney has not given a running total for Disney+ sales of “Black Widow.”</p><p>Making “Black Widow” available on Disney+ could cost Ms. Johansson more than $50 million, according to two people briefed on her contract, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private agreement. That is how much Ms. Johansson would have made if “Black Widow” had approached $1 billion in global ticket sales; “Captain Marvel” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/movies/black-panther-700-million-globally-box-office.html" title="">Black Panther</a>” both exceeded that threshold in prepandemic release.</p></div></div><div><p>Films released during the pandemic — including those that have received exclusive theatrical releases — have largely disappointed at the box office, with many consumers demonstrating a reluctance to return to theaters. The entire film ecosystem has been hurt as a result: cinema chains, stars, studios.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Disney has cited the coronavirus as a reason for releasing movies like “Black Widow” simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jay Maidment/Marvel Studios, via Disney</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“First, Disney wanted to lure the picture’s audience away from movie theaters and towards its own streaming service, where it could keep the revenues for itself while simultaneously growing the Disney+ subscriber base, a proven way to boost Disney’s stock price,” the suit, which was first reported on by The Wall Street Journal, claimed. “Second, Disney wanted to substantially devalue Ms. Johansson’s agreement and thereby enrich itself.”</p><p>Disney’s statement called the lawsuit “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The company added, “Disney has fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of ‘Black Widow’ on Disney+ with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20 million she has received to date.”</p><p>“Black Widow” was initially scheduled for exclusive theatrical release in May of last year. Disney ended up postponing the film’s release three times as the pandemic dragged on.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Disney, citing the continuing coronavirus threat, ultimately decided to release several major movies simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access. It used the strategy in May for “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/movies/cruella-review.html" title="">Cruella</a>,” which starred Emma Stone and took in $221 million worldwide. (Disney has kept Disney+ revenue for “Cruella” a secret.) On Friday, Disney will give the same treatment to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/movies/jungle-cruise-disney.html" title="">The Jungle Cruise</a>,” a comedic adventure that stars Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson. It is not known if Ms. Stone, Ms. Blunt and Mr. Johnson renegotiated their contracts with Disney as a result.</p><p>In December, WarnerMedia kicked a hornet’s nest by abruptly announcing that more than a dozen Warner Bros. movies — the studio’s entire 2021 slate — would each arrive in theaters and on HBO Max. The decision prompted an outcry from major stars and their agents over the potential loss of box office-related compensation, forcing Warner Bros. to make new deals. It ultimately paid roughly $200 million to thwart the rebellion.</p><p>The deeper question is this: If old-line studios are no longer trying to maximize the box office for each film but instead shifting to a hybrid model where success is judged partly by ticket sales and partly by the number of streaming subscriptions sold, what does that mean for how stars are paid — and where they make their movies?</p><p>The traditional model, the one that studios have used for decades to make high-profile film deals, involves paying small fees upfront and then sharing a portion of the revenue from ticket sales. The bigger the hit, the bigger the “back end” paydays for certain actors, directors and producers.</p><p>The streaming giants have done it differently. They pay more upfront — usually much, much more — in lieu of any back-end payments, which gives them complete control over future revenue. It means that people get paid as if their projects are hits before they are released (or even made).</p><p>Ms. Johansson’s suit also took direct aim at Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, and Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chairman, by citing the stock grants given to them as rewards for building Disney+, which has more than 100 million subscribers worldwide. “Disney’s financial disclosures make clear that the very Disney executives who orchestrated this strategy will personally benefit from their and Disney’s misconduct,” the complaint said.</p><p>According to the suit, Ms. Johansson’s representatives approached Disney and Marvel in recent months with a request to renegotiate her contract. “Disney and Marvel largely ignored Ms. Johansson,” the suit said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a separate civil case filed on Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission also accused Mr. Milton of securities fraud.</p><p>The twin legal filings are the biggest lightning bolts that prosecutors and securities regulators have delivered to the supercharged market for the investment vehicles known as special-purpose acquisition companies, which regulators and some investors have argued are rife with potential problems. More such cases could be filed in the coming months; regulators are investigating several other companies and executives in similar circumstances.</p><p>The investment vehicles, called SPACs, have raised nearly $200 billion in initial public offerings for the express purpose of finding and buying an operating business. If SPACs don’t buy a company within two years, their sponsors, often professional investors or Wall Street bankers, have to return the cash they raised — a provision that critics argue encourages them to buy shaky or unproven businesses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The boom in SPACs has coincided with and been spurred on by retail investors who share trading tips and strategies on social media, often deciding en masse to buy the shares of companies they believe are undervalued or are destined for greatness. These individual traders, often with the encouragement of professional investors or corporate executives, have helped drive up the stock prices of various companies, including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and Tesla.</p><p>Prosecutors and the S.E.C. said that for nearly a year, Mr. Milton had used social media, television and podcasts to spread “false and misleading statements regarding Nikola’s product and technology.”</p><p>One such misleading statement, the charging document filed by prosecutors said, concerned the company’s Nikola One long-distance truck prototype. The prototype did not work, contrary to the glowing statements Mr. Milton made about it.</p><p>Federal prosecutors and securities regulators started investigating Nikola last fall around the time an investment firm published a report questioning its products and some of Mr. Milton’s claims. That firm, Hindenburg Research, said the company had put out a promotional video to suggest it had a working prototype — but never disclosed that the truck was moving forward only because it was rolling down a hill in neutral gear. Mr. Milton resigned a few weeks later.</p><p>The S.E.C. also noted in its complaint that a Bloomberg News article, published in June 2020, said Mr. Milton had “exaggerated” the truck’s abilities.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Yet Nikola went public in June 2020 in a $700 million merger with a SPAC called VectorIQ, which was founded by Steve Girsky, a former General Motors executive and board member who has also worked at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Girsky put Mr. Milton and Nikola in touch with G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, and the two companies agreed to work together on heavy-duty and pickup trucks; that deal was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/business/gm-nikola-electric-trucks.html" title="">greatly scaled back in November</a>.</p><p>Some young, untested businesses have opted to merge with SPACs because doing so is usually faster, requires fewer disclosures and attracts less scrutiny from investors and regulators than a conventional initial public offering. Nikola, for example, managed to go public just five years after Mr. Milton founded it.</p><p>“In carrying out his fraudulent scheme, Milton exploited features of the SPAC structure,” Audrey Strauss, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Thursday.</p><p>Federal prosecutors contend that retail investors were hurt by the stock’s sharp drop, which started last summer, but not early investors in the company, including Mr. Milton. Nikola’s shares fell about 15 percent on Thursday, to around $12, compared with more than $65 in the middle of last year, a point at which the company had a valuation in excess of Ford Motor’s.</p><p>The S.E.C.’s complaint said Mr. Milton had held about 25 percent of Nikola’s stock after the SPAC deal and “ultimately reaped tens of millions of dollars in personal benefits as a result of his misconduct.” Securities regulators noted that Mr. Milton had “embarked on a relentless public relations blitz aimed at a class of investors he called ‘Robinhood investors’” — a reference to the popular retail brokerage firm, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/robinhood-stock.html" title="">just raised $2.1 billion in its own initial public offering</a>.</p><p>Mr. Milton’s legal team said in a statement that the government was seeking to “criminalize lawful business conduct.” The team added, “Mr. Milton has been wrongfully accused following a faulty and incomplete investigation in which the government ignored critical evidence and failed to interview important witnesses.”</p><p>Mr. Milton was taken into custody in Manhattan on Thursday morning and was released on a $100 million bond co-signed by two other people and secured by two properties worth $40 million.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Nikola said in a statement that Mr. Milton had not been involved with the company since resigning in September. “Today’s government actions are against Mr. Milton individually, and not against the company,” the company said. “Nikola has cooperated with the government throughout the course of its inquiry.”</p><p>The authorities did not charge other individuals, including other executives, or the company itself with wrongdoing. The S.E.C.’s complaint appeared to justify its sole focus on Mr. Milton by noting that even after he had become executive chairman of Nikola after the merger with VectorIQ, he had firm control over the company and remained its primary spokesman and gave orders to others. The complaint called him a hands-on executive who “engrossed himself in the details of Nikola’s technology and product development process.”</p><p>Mr. Milton, who dropped out of high school and college, started Nikola with the aim of becoming the Tesla of trucking. Like Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, he cultivated a reputation as a charismatic showman with a grand vision for revolutionizing an industry. “We’re going to completely control trucking in America,” he <a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/articles/were-going-to-completely-control-trucking-in-america-nikolas-trevor-milton/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Automotive World last year</a>.</p><p>Mr. Milton even named his company after the inventor whose last name Mr. Musk’s business uses, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/technology/nikola-tesla.html" title="">Nikola Tesla</a>.</p><p>Enticed by the prospects of finding the next Tesla, big and small investors poured money into start-ups like Nikola in recent years. They came to believe that the world would rapidly switch from fossil fuel cars and trucks to electric and hydrogen vehicles, and that start-ups, not established automakers like G.M. and Daimler, would lead the way. But unlike Tesla, which has produced and sold hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles over several years, many of the newer entrants have struggled to make even a few thousand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Audrey Strauss, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that Mr. Milton surrendered on Thursday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Richard Drew/Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The S.E.C. has been warning investors beginning this year about the dangers of SPACs and the businesses they acquire, specifically that people should not be lulled by overly optimistic claims. A handful of companies that completed mergers have disclosed investigations by the S.E.C., federal prosecutors or both.</p></div><div><div><p>The Stanford Law School Securities Clearinghouse <a href="https://securities.stanford.edu/current-trends.html#collapse1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found that at least 30 companies</a> that went public through a merger with a SPAC had been sued by shareholders since 2019.</p><p>Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said authorities “are sending a message they think SPACs are breeding ground for things more serious than just sloppy disclosure.” He added, “They think it is breeding ground for fraud and misrepresentation.”</p><p>Just two weeks ago, the S.E.C. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/business/sec-spac-momentus-stable-road.html" title="">reached a settlement </a>with several parties involved in the planned merger of Momentus, a company that said it had developed a unique propulsion technology, and Stable Road Acquisition, a SPAC. The regulators said investors were misled into believing the propulsion system had been successfully tested in space when it had in fact failed.</p><p>Federal prosecutors and securities regulators are also investigating Lordstown Motors, a company that hopes to make electric pickup trucks and merged with a SPAC last year.</p><p>Lordstown, based in Ohio, said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/business/lordstown-motors-yorkville-advisors.html" title="">raised much-needed cash this week</a>, but it has yet to begin commercial production. Federal authorities are investigating whether the company and its founder, Steve Burns, who resigned as chief executive in June, exaggerated claims about customer interest in its truck, which is meant to be used by businesses like contractors and utilities.</p><p>Federal prosecutors are also investigating Lordstown’s merger with DiamondPeak, a SPAC put together by David Hamamoto, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/business/lordstown-motors-dealmaker.html" title="">former Goldman Sachs partner</a> and a Wall Street real estate investor.</p><p>But proponents of SPACs said the charges against Mr. Milton and other investigations should not be used to tar the reputation of these investment vehicles, which some people on Wall Street assert are innovative. Douglas Ellenoff, a New York lawyer whose firm has specialized in representing the founder of SPACs, said some regulators had been “putting out statements that are stigmatizing the industry at large.”</p><p>Julie Creswell<!-- --> and <!-- -->Neal E.

But challenges to the company’s labor practices are growing quickly, too.</p><p>Those challenges were underscored when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/business/amazon-union-alabama-nlrb.html" title="">a hearing officer for the National Labor Relations Board recommended</a> a new union election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/amazon-defeats-union.html" title="">at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama</a>, saying the company’s conduct during the organizing campaign had precluded a fair vote.</p><p>The board’s regional office will rule on the recommendation in the coming weeks. If it leads to a new election, as seems likely, the union would face long odds of victory. But Amazon faces a widening campaign to rein in the power it wields over its employees and their workplace conditions.</p><p>Those efforts include a campaign by the Teamsters that would generally circumvent traditional workplace elections and pressure the company through protests, boycotts and even fights against its expansion efforts at the local level. Legislation in California would force Amazon to reveal its productivity quotas, which unions contend are onerous and put workers at risk.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Amazon warehouse workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html" title="">have protested</a> what they consider unsafe conditions, sometimes resulting in embarrassment for the company, as with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the disclosure of notes from an internal meeting</a> in which an Amazon executive called a worker-turned-protester “not smart, or articulate.”</p><p>In April, the general counsel of the labor board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html" title="">found merit to charges</a> that Amazon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/business/stock-market-covid-coronavirus.html#link-b8bac86" title="">fired two white-collar workers</a> who had raised concerns last year about the conditions facing the company’s warehouse workers during the pandemic. </p><p>The election in Alabama brought intense scrutiny of the company’s labor practices, with even President Biden taking it as an opportunity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/business/economy/joe-biden-unions.html" title="">to warn employers</a> that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda” during such a campaign.</p><p>In a statement after the hearing officer’s recommendation was reported on Monday, Amazon said, “Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers.”</p><p>Since the results were announced in early April, showing that Amazon won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/amazon-defeats-union.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">more than two to one</a>, many unions and union supporters have argued that the outcome points to the need for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/business/economy/amazon-labor-unions.html" title="">new tactics</a> to organize the company.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Perhaps the most prominent voice in this discussion is the more than one-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which approved a resolution <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/business/economy/amazon-union-teamsters.html" title="">at its convention in June</a> committing the union to “supply all resources necessary” to organize workers at the company and help them win a union contract.</p><p>The Teamsters argue that holding union votes at individual work sites is typically futile at a company like Amazon, because labor law allows employers to wage aggressive anti-union campaigns, and because high turnover means union supporters often leave the company before they have a chance to vote.</p><p>Instead, the Teamsters favor a combination of tactics like strikes, protests and boycotts that pressure the company to come to the bargaining table and negotiate a contract covering wages, benefits and working conditions. While the union hasn’t laid out its tactics in detail, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/terminal-at-port-of-la-impacted-by-truck-driver-strike/2573504/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it recently organized</a> walkouts involving drivers and dockworkers at a port in Southern California to protest the drivers’ treatment there.</p><p>They hope to enlist the help of workers at other companies, sympathetic consumers and even local businesses threatened by a giant like Amazon, partly to mitigate the challenges presented by high employee turnover.</p><p>“Building our relationships within the community itself is the way to deal with that,” Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official from Southern California who is the union’s national director for Amazon, said in a recent interview. “We could have filed for an election in a number of places in the last more than a year, gotten into that process, but we realize that the election process has its shortcomings.”</p><p>The union believes that it can pull a variety of political levers to help put the company on the defensive. Mr. Korgan cited a recent vote by the City Council in Fort Wayne, Ind., denying Amazon a tax abatement after <a href="https://teamster.org/2021/07/after-sustained-push-from-local-414-fort-wayne-city-council-nixes-amazon-tax-abatement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a local Teamsters official</a> spoke out against it, and a vote by the City Council in Arvada, Colo., <a href="https://teamster.org/2021/06/colorado-teamsters-unite-to-say-no-to-amazon-in-their-backyards/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to reject</a> a more than 100,000-square-foot Amazon delivery station. While the Arvada vote centered on traffic concerns, Teamsters played a role in drumming up opposition.</p><p>In California, the Teamsters have joined forces with the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, an advocacy group, to back a bill that would require certain employers to disclose the often opaque productivity quotas applied to workers, which they can be disciplined or fired for failing to meet. The legislative language makes it clear that Amazon is the main target.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The bill, offered by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the author of a 2019 law effectively requiring gig companies to classify workers as employees, would also direct the state’s occupational safety and health agency to develop a regulation ensuring that such quotas don’t put workers at high risk of injury. It passed the State Assembly in May and will be considered by the State Senate later this summer.</p><p>Other labor groups are pressing ahead with less orthodox efforts to increase the power of Amazon workers. Over the first six months of this year, a group called the Solidarity Fund, which raises money from individual tech workers, distributed over $100,000 in grants to workers seeking to organize their colleagues to push for workplace improvements.</p><p>About half the money, in $2,500 increments, went to workers at Amazon. It funded a laptop to assist with organizing, as well as hiring a freelance graphic designer to help make pamphlets, among the varied efforts. Later this month, the fund will begin accepting applications for a second round of grants.</p><p>The group’s sister organization, called Coworker.org, is putting together a detailed report on workplace surveillance measures, including a number of technologies that it says Amazon either developed or pays other companies to use. </p><p>Along with these efforts, the company is likely to face another high-profile election at its warehouse in Bessemer, Ala. Labor law experts said that in such cases a regional director typically accepts the recommendation of the hearing officer, who argued for setting aside the results.</p><p>The officer recommended the dismissal of many of the union’s objections to the election, including the contention that Amazon illegally threatened workers with a loss of pay or benefits if they unionized. But she found that a collection box that Amazon pressured the U.S. Postal Service to install near the warehouse entrance gave workers the impression that the company was monitoring who was voting, thereby tainting the outcome.</p><p>A union brief described how Amazon surrounded the collection box with a tent, on which it printed a company campaign message (“Speak for Yourself”) and the instruction “Mail Your Ballot Here.” The union noted that Amazon’s surveillance cameras could record workers entering and leaving the tent. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If the labor board’s regional office accepts the recommendation to order a new election, Amazon has vowed to appeal to the five-member board in Washington. A recent shift there may affect the outcome: Democrats were assured control of the board in late July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/senate-approves-union-lawyer-wilcox-nlrb-seat-2021-07-28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when the Senate confirmed</a> two of President Biden’s nominees.</p><p>Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which oversaw the union campaign at the Amazon warehouse, acknowledged in an interview after the first election that high turnover at Amazon and the company’s ability to hold mandatory anti-union meetings made winning a vote difficult. But he said that a long-term campaign could be victorious.</p><p>“I think that we’re going to be able to build on this,” Mr. Appelbaum said. “We pushed the ball downfield. Maybe it’s not the first election. Maybe it’s the second or third election.”</p><p>Workers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/business/economy/amazon-warehouse-labor-robots.html" title="">long complained</a> that one of the most fundamental features of an Amazon warehouse is the amount of control the company exerts — over the pace of work, the way workers perform it, the frequency of their breaks, the time they must spend waiting at metal detectors on their way home.</p><p>In its objection to the election results, the union argued that Amazon had tried to assert a similar level of control over the voting itself, through measures like the collection box. Now the labor board appears on the verge of clawing some of that power back.</p><p>The board’s role in administering union elections was “usurped” by Amazon’s conduct in obtaining the box, the hearing officer said. That conduct, she said, “justifies a second election.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

She was paid $1,000.</p><p>Ms. Lugrin was thrilled. But after seeing her face plastered on billboards and in ads across the internet, she realized she had undervalued herself.</p><p>As she spoke with more influencers, who create social media posts for brands in exchange for payment or a cut of advertising fees, Ms. Lugrin became aware of other pay disparities. Male creators earned an average of $476 per post and women $348, according to an analysis last year by <a href="https://klear.com/blog/the-2020-influencer-pricing-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Klear</a>, an influencer marketing platform.</p><p>Ms. Lugrin, now 30, was determined to change that. So in June, she and Isha Mehra, 25, a former Facebook data scientist, introduced an app with an unprintable name: <a href="https://www.fypm.vip/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F*** You Pay Me</a>. It functions as a kind of <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> for influencers, where creators can leave reviews of brands they have worked with, share ad rates, and give and get other crucial information for negotiating sponsored content deals. The aim: to have creators be paid more equitably.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The in-your-face name was deliberate, Ms. Lugrin said. “I didn’t want there to be any doubt from the creator side of things who this is for,” she said. “The name is an ode to the frustration I experienced myself many times over as a creator.”</p><p>FYPM, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., is one of several companies now aiming to bring pay transparency to influencers, whose field is one of the fastest growing among small businesses in the United States. It’s part of a shift where creators are increasingly trying to assert themselves in their business dealings with brands and gain a more level playing field.</p><p>Among the tools that have proliferated is <a href="https://collabstr.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collabstr</a>, a marketing platform that lets creators post brief biographies about themselves and list their pay rates. Social media pages like <a href="https://brandsbehavingbadly.carrd.co/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brands Behaving Badly</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wedontworkforfree/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">We Don’t Work for Free</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/influencerpaygap/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Influencer Pay Gap</a> call attention to bad deals and potentially exploitative brands.</p><p>Creators have also bonded in online communities like <a href="https://kelseyinlondon.com/creativegalgang/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creative Gal Gang</a>, where female influencers in Britain and Ireland trade horror stories and offer peer support. Some creators have also begun <a href="https://branddealwizard.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">selling courses</a> to teach others how to negotiate better rates.</p><p>“Creators need to realize we have the power,” River Johnson, 29, a creator in Half Moon Bay, Calif., said of the relationship between influencers and brands. “They need us, not the other way around.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Brands have long had an upper hand with influencers. Most creators operate without a manager or an agent. There are no standard pay rates for creating a post for a brand or running digital advertising alongside their videos and posts. Brand deals are negotiated through a messy mix of direct messages and emails.</p><p>Creators are also typically single-person businesses that act as media and marketing mini-agencies all in one. They conceive, shoot, edit, promote and write all of their own content, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/instagram-husbands-are-no-longer-ashamed/580033/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sometimes with the support of a spouse or partner</a>, across multiple social platforms every day. It can be time-consuming and grueling work that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/style/creator-burnout-social-media.html" title="">results in burnout</a>.</p><p>And while brands generally have a lot of information on creators — influencer marketing platforms allow companies to sort and filter through millions of influencers by follower count, demographic and social media platform — creators have little information on brands and what they pay.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Screenshots of the FYPM platform.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>FYPM</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>That ruffled Ms. Lugrin. A native of Houston, she earned a master’s degree in finance from the University of Houston in 2018 and became an equity analyst. Outside her day job, she built up her online persona with the handle <a href="https://www.instagram.com/msyoungprofessional/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@msyoungprofessional</a>, posting relatable humor and memes about being a woman in the business world.</p><p>Ms. Lugrin eventually gained over 16,000 followers and started making brand deals with fashion companies and start-ups. But the lack of information for negotiating pay frustrated her.</p><p>When she lost her job in the spring of last year during the pandemic, she decided to do something about it. She began conducting market research and harvesting information from creators about their brand deals.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In October, Ms. Lugrin posted a blog post announcing FYPM, which, <a href="https://msyoungprofessional.com/?p=622" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she wrote</a>, was “birthed out of rage.” Taking aim at influencer marketing platforms, she said most were “really just another platform designed to help more business owners exploit influencer talent, but in a new ‘innovative’ way!”</p><p>After building a prototype of FYPM, she was accepted in March into a 10-week start-up incubator program in Taiwan led by Backend Capital, a venture capital firm. There she met her co-founder, Ms. Mehra, who was on the hunt for her next challenge.</p><p>“I wanted to use technology for good,” Ms. Mehra said. “I saw FYPM as a perfect way to tackle pay inequality.”</p><p>FYPM is already on the radar of brands. James Nord, chief executive and founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing company that has paid out over $65 million to creators in the past five years, said he supported Ms. Lugrin’s mission but hoped more nuance could be incorporated into the platform as it grew.</p><p>“It can lead to some creators having false expectations of what their pay could be because they hear about one person who booked one job at one specific price,” he said.</p><p>FYPM, which is still being tested, allows users to filter brand deals by platform such as Twitter, Clubhouse, Substack, Instagram and OnlyFans. Creators can also sort by location, niche and brand category, such as travel or food and drink.</p><p>So far, about 1,500 creators have posted more than 2,000 reviews of 1,300 brands on FYPM. Ms. Lugrin and Ms. Mehra have raised a small amount of funding and plan to do more fund-raising.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On the app, a review of Fishbowl, a networking platform, recently told creators to ask for more money. “There’s room in the budget, so make sure to negotiate,” it said.</p><p>Another review, of the Coldest Water, a water-bottle company, warned creators about the pay: “Offered $600 for 6 videos on my tiktok account with over 2 million followers. ‘free’ water bottle included and then a 10 percent commissions sale. turned it down because they had low pay and it felt borderline scammy.”</p><p>Kyle McCarthy, head of growth at the Fishbowl, said the company was “committed to fair pay.” </p><p>Daniel Herrold, 47, a creator in Tulsa, Okla., who is focused on divorce and lifestyle content, said FYPM had been a lifeline.</p><p>“I started to get approached six months ago by random brands,” he said. “The challenge for me and anyone else in the space is that I don’t even know what a market deal is.”</p><p>Data collected by FYPM so far shows that meme pages, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/style/the-clout.html" title="">post</a> humorous or visually oriented content, and pet influencers are most likely to undersell themselves. YouTube creators earn the most.</p><p>Food and beverage brands pay the most, beating out beauty, lifestyle and fashion companies. About 55 percent of creators on FYPM reported being paid in cash, while others were offered “exposure” or free products. Half received nothing for their work, Ms. Lugrin said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Ms. Lugrin and Ms. Mehra at their office in Santa Monica, Calif. They met in March at a start-up incubator program led by Backend Capital.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Amanda Hakan for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Creators who speak out about lack of payment can be attacked. When a brand tried to lowball Tori Dunlap, 27, a TikTok creator with over 1.6 million followers, in November, she created a TikTok about it.</p></div><div><div><p>“I went on TikTok and was like, ‘Brands, you need to stop doing this,’” she said. But “I got death threats. I got people messaging me, ‘Sit down and shut up’ and ‘You entitled insert-terrible-word here.’”</p><p>Many creators are women and people of color, Ms. Dunlap added, so brands are taking advantage of these broader communities.</p><p>“We all have to talk to each other and say, ‘This brand reached out to me — what did they offer you?’” she said.</p><p>Ms. Lugrin said she hoped FYPM would help make life as a creator more profitable for everyone, including those without millions of followers or money to fall back on.</p><p>This “is about the future of work,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the agency will have to wait a little longer.</p><p>A launch of the orbital capsule, scheduled for 1:20 p.m. Eastern time, was postponed on Tuesday morning. A <a href="https://starlinerupdates.com/nasa-boeing-to-delay-starliner-launch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boeing statement</a> said its engineers detected “unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system.” Later in the day, the company said in a second statement that it had “ruled out software as a cause.” That could indicate something is wrong with the valve hardware, and that might take longer to fix.</p><p>The Boeing statement added that it would not proceed with the next scheduled launch window on Wednesday as it needed additional time to assess the issue.</p><p>Boeing is one of two companies that NASA has hired to take its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. (SpaceX is the other, with its Crew Dragon spacecraft.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>Two years ago, Boeing appeared to be on track to be the first to be ready to put astronauts on board.</p><p>About all that remained was a demonstration flight with no astronauts on board, which launched in December 2019. Embarrassingly, things went wrong almost immediately, exposing flawed software, and calling to mind problems that Boeing’s aviation division had with the 737 Max jet, which led to a pair of fatal crashes.</p><p>Not only was Starliner not ready for astronauts, but it took Boeing more than a year to analyze what went wrong, rewrite its software and validate that the spacecraft would be trustworthy.</p><h2 id="link-30a05740">Why was the launch delayed last week?</h2><p>This is actually the second delay in a week: Starliner was scheduled to launch on Friday. But then events in orbit around Earth intervened.</p><p>Russia had launched a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/science/russia-module-space-station.html" title="">new space station module, Nauka, which successfully docked</a> Thursday morning. But then Nauka’s thrusters inadvertently started firing again, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/science/nasa-space-station-zebulon-scoville.html" title="">pushing the International Space Station into a spin</a>, revolving around one and a half times before controllers got it back under control after about an hour.</p></div></div><div><p>The space station appears to have survived no worse for wear from its unplanned gymnastics routine, but NASA managers wanted to take time to make sure. Because of classified military operations at Cape Canaveral over the weekend, the next launch opportunity was Tuesday afternoon.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">An artist’s rendering of Starliner in orbit above Earth.

But the biggest objective is to test the docking system, which remained untested during the first flight.</p><p>Although there will not be astronauts aboard, the capsule will not be empty. In the commander’s seat will be Rosie the Rocketeer, a mannequin outfitted with 15 sensors to collect data on the conditions people will experience during the flight. Rosie was aboard during the first Starliner trip.</p><p>The capsule is also carrying 400 pounds of cargo and supplies to the space station.</p><p>Starliner is to remain docked at the space station for five to 10 days before returning to Earth, landing with parachutes and a large airbag in the desert in the western United States (a contrast to SpaceX’s capsule, which lands in the sea off Florida).</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div></section><div><p>Robinhood’s free stock-trading service has helped create the conditions for wild trading gyrations in meme stocks, driven by investors hyping their trades on social media. The company’s offering is among the largest in a frenzied year for public market debuts, though few others have had the profile and level of controversy — including service outages, fines, congressional hearings, protests and memes — as Robinhood.</p></div><div><div><p>But the tepid trading debut suggested that there may be limits to investors’ euphoria for I.P.O.s, even in a blockbuster year for them. There were 213 in the first six months of the year, more than in any full year for the last decade, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks I.P.O.s. This week alone was set to have 25 companies go public in the United States, making it the busiest in two decades. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/technology/instacart-raises-265-million.html" title="">Instacart</a>, the grocery delivery company, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/06/business/economy-stock-market-news#nextdoor-the-social-network-for-neighborhoods-plans-to-go-public" title="">Nextdoor</a>, the social network, are among the others expected to go public this year.</p><p>A first-day slump like Robinhood’s is rare. On average, shares in I.P.O.s in the United States jumped 39 percent on their first day of trading this year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. But they have since fallen by an average of 1.6 percent, according to Renaissance Capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mr. Tenev, center, and Baiju Bhatt, left, Robinhood’s founders, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sasha Maslov for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/robinhood-ipo.html" title="">unpredictability of Robinhood’s initial trading</a> was exacerbated by an unusual move by the company, which has a mission of democratizing finance. Robinhood decided to sell as much as a third of its offering to retail traders via its own app. Most other companies that have gone public have not done this or have offered only a small amount of shares to retail investors.</p><p>That offering could have suppressed early trading, since first-day stock price “pops” are often driven by demand from retail investors who were shut out of the I.P.O. Only around 20 percent of the offering was sold to retail customers, a person with knowledge of the offering said, indicating less interest than expected.</p></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev.html" title="">Vlad Tenev</a>, Robinhood’s chief executive and a co-founder, said in an interview that the I.P.O. was a “celebration of the individual investor in America.” He added, “We’re just mindful that this is an important moment for our customers as well.”</p><p>Robinhood’s lukewarm public debut raises questions for the Silicon Valley company after a rocky year.</p><p>Early in the pandemic, as the stock market crashed, Robinhood suffered outages at crucial moments. As the year went on and the app became more popular, commentators raised questions about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html" title="">level of risk that traders</a> were taking, especially with highly leveraged options trades.</p><p>Other aspects of Robinhood’s app, including confetti explosions and lottery scratch-offs, have drawn comparisons to gambling. One young customer, Alex Kearns, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance/?sh=3e4ef6e41638" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed himself last year</a> after a misunderstanding over debt in his account. Robinhood has since settled with his family.</p><p>In January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html" title="">stock traders banded together on social media</a> to drive up the share price of meme stocks including GameStop, the gaming retailer, and AMC Entertainment, the movie theater chain.</p><p>Robinhood had to halt some trades and raise rounds of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html" title="">emergency funding</a> to cover the collateral needed for its customers’ trades. Mr. Tenev’s cellphone was seized by the authorities as part of an investigation into the situation. Robinhood was sued more than 50 times, and Mr. Tenev was summoned to testify in Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Robinhood allowed its customers to buy into its initial public offering via its app.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sasha Maslov for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>In June, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html" title="">Robinhood paid a $70 million fine</a> to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for misleading customers and harming them with outages.</p></div><div><div><p>The controversies did not seem to hurt Robinhood’s growth. The company added nearly 10 million customers over the last year, bringing its expected total at the end of June to 22.5 million. It more than quadrupled its revenue to $420 million in the first three months of the year, compared with $96 million a year earlier. It also posted a loss of $1.4 billion, which it attributed to the emergency debt that it had raised as a result of the GameStop trading in January.</p><p>“Robinhood is a growth stock and it has the potential to continue growing, but the market is saying this growth doesn’t come without risk,” said Josh White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University, after Robinhood’s shares started trading. “Maybe it’s not a $32 billion stock.”</p><p>Mr. Tenev, 34, and Baiju Bhatt, 36, founded Robinhood in 2013 with an eye toward disrupting the entrenched interests of Wall Street. They sought to make stock investing fast and free via their mobile app. Rather than charge a commission on each trade like traditional brokerages, Robinhood sold its customers’ orders to Wall Street firms for a small fee per trade. Eventually, many of Robinhood’s traditional competitors lowered their trading fees to zero.</p><p>The company expanded into other areas. It allows people to trade cryptocurrencies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/technology/hes-a-dogecoin-millionaire-and-hes-not-selling.html" title="">the joke currency Dogecoin</a>, which accounted for a third of its revenue from crypto trading in the first quarter. It expanded into checking and savings accounts, though that launch was an embarrassment after it claimed the product was backed by a consumer protection group that does not insure such offerings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A crowd in Times Square viewing the market debut of Robinhood, which was valued at $29 billion at the close of trading.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sasha Maslov for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>More recently Robinhood expanded into I.P.O. offerings, including its own. It also said it would soon introduce retirement saving accounts.</p></div><div><div><p>Along the way, Robinhood attracted more than $2 billion in venture funding. Its largest investors include New Enterprise Associates and Index Ventures.</p><p>Scott Sandell, an investor at New Enterprise Associates who sits on Robinhood’s board, said the I.P.O. had created needed transparency about Robinhood’s business.</p><p>“There has been so much speculation about the company, and much of it is completely false,” he said. “Now that Robinhood is public, it’s all there for everyone to see.”</p><p>In its offering prospectus, Robinhood said Mr. Tenev and Mr. Bhatt together would own 16 percent of Robinhood’s shares after the I.P.O., making their combined stakes in the company worth nearly $5 billion. They own a special class of supervoting shares that give them 65 percent of the voting power over the company.</p><p>Robinhood used its I.P.O. to promote itself as a democratizing force in finance. In a defiant letter, its founders said that “finance is now as culturally relevant as music and the arts,” and that they were pained by news reports that “lambasted” the next generation of investors.</p><p>But in the lead-up to Robinhood’s listing, some traders said they were already plotting to band together to dump the stock or bet against it as retribution for the trading halt in January.</p><p>That simmering frustration did not deter Mr. Tenev and Mr. Bhatt on Thursday.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><figure><figcaption><p><h3>Listen to This Article</h3></p></figcaption><div></div></figure><div><div><p>Mena Yousif wore dark clothing to the protest, with white sneakers and a blue hijab that she could pull over her face, perfect gear during a pandemic. Jose Felan, stocky and tall, wore a baseball cap and a gray T-shirt that showed off a distinctive tattoo on his forearm: “Mena,” with a crown above the “a.”</p><p>The couple had driven an hour north from Rochester to Minneapolis to join a crowd down the street from the State Capitol. It was three days after George Floyd had been killed by a white police officer; the couple was part of a growing protest movement that would send people into the streets across America to express their anger, frustration and pain over Mr. Floyd’s death.</p><p>Ms. Yousif, 22, had moved to Minnesota as a child, after her parents fled war-torn Iraq. She worked a series of retail jobs, including a stint at Chipotle, and was earning a business degree at a community college. Mr. Felan, 34, had bounced between Texas and Minnesota for most of his life, and had run afoul of the law in both places.</p><p>The unrest in Minneapolis had started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/minneapolis-government-george-floyd.html" title="">to get destructive</a> — that night, the National Guard would be called in — and the authorities would later allege in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/02/us/complaint-against-jose-felan.html" title="">court filings</a> that Mr. Felan was one of those to blame. He was carrying a thin white bag, sheer enough that, according to a criminal complaint, three canisters of diesel fuel were visible inside after he walked into a Napa Auto Parts store on University Avenue in St. Paul. Around 6 p.m., as captured on surveillance footage, he and Ms. Yousif entered a Goodwill next door and made their way into a back storage room where Mr. Felan allegedly took one of the diesel fuel canisters out of his bag, poured its contents onto a stack of cardboard boxes, and set them on fire.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Federal authorities assert that Mr. Felan also helped set fires at a school across the street and at a gas station, which were among over <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-st-paul-buildings-are-damaged-looted-after-george-floyd-protests-riots/569930671/?refresh=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,500 buildings damaged that week</a>. The surveillance footage from that day set off a nearly yearlong, international manhunt for the couple, involving multiple federal agencies and Mexican police. The pursuit also involved a facial recognition system made by a Chinese company that has been blacklisted by the U.S. government.</p><p>Ms. Yousif gave birth while on the run, and was separated from her baby for four months by the authorities. To prosecutors, the pursuit of Mr. Felan, who was charged with arson, and Ms. Yousif, who was charged with helping him flee, was a routine response to a case of property destruction. To fellow protesters, it’s part of an extreme crackdown on those who most fervently demonstrated against America’s criminal justice system.</p><p>But beyond the prosecutorial aftermath of the racial justice protests, the eight-month saga of a young Minnesota couple exposed an emerging global surveillance system that might one day find anyone, anywhere, the technology traveling easily over borders while civil liberties struggle to keep pace.</p><h2 id="link-2a813bfd">The Pursuit</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/29/business/29Fugitives-video-01/29Fugitives-video-01-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/29/business/29Fugitives-video-01/29Fugitives-video-01-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/29/business/29Fugitives-video-01/29Fugitives-video-01-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A video of Jose Felan “went viral,” leading to “several tips, including from individuals who wish to remain anonymous,” an A.T.F. agent said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, St. Paul Field Division</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>As the political and corporate worlds wrestled with addressing racial injustice in America, and the events in Minneapolis overtook the Covid-19 crisis and the presidential campaign, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F., got to work trying to find the people who set fires.</p></div><div><div><p>The A.T.F., which is tasked with investigating arson cases, <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/atf-offers-70000-solve-twin-cities-arson-cases" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/persons-interest-twin-cities-arson-cases-imagery-sought" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photos</a> of suspects, offering $5,000 for helpful tips from the public. A <a href="https://twitter.com/ATFStPaul/status/1269764003817050112?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of Mr. Felan “went viral,” leading to “several tips, including from individuals who wish to remain anonymous,” an A.T.F. agent said in a court document. (The A.T.F. has also used facial recognition technology, including the app Clearview AI, to identify unknown people, according to reporting from <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-518" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Government Accountability Office</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BuzzFeed</a>.)</p><p>Mr. Felan and Ms. Yousif could not be reached for comment. Mr. Felan’s lawyer declined to comment as the case is pending, and Ms. Yousif’s lawyer did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him. This report is largely drawn from government documents and sources, and based on the account of their lives there, they were likely panicked. Mr. Felan had previous legal troubles.</p><p>And Ms. Yousif was approximately seven months pregnant.</p><p>So they drove, heading south on Interstate 35, a highway that runs down the middle of the country, stretching from Duluth, Minn., on Lake Superior, to Laredo, Texas, on the Mexican border. They had made their way through Iowa and just hit the northern part of Missouri, 300 miles from Rochester, when police first caught up with them.</p><p>A warrant had been issued for Mr. Felan’s arrest, allowing the authorities to ping his cellphone to locate him. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/02/us/complaint-against-mena-yousif.html" title="">a court document</a>, late on a Monday night, more than a week after the events in St. Paul, local police in rural western Missouri, who were asked to go where the phone was pinging, stopped a black S.U.V. registered to Mr. Felan. Ms. Yousif was driving, and said she didn’t know where Mr. Felan was. The police let her go.</p><p>Ms. Yousif was then charged with helping Mr. Felan flee, and the A.T.F. put out <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/couple-run-10000-reward-info-leading-apprehension" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new request for help</a>, setting the reward at $10,000: “We’re asking the public to be on the lookout for the couple along the Interstate 35 corridor.”</p><p>Over the next week, police kept pinging the location of Mr. Felan’s phone but kept missing him. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/02/us/complaint-against-leeroy-felan.html" title="">a court document</a>, he sent a message to his brother in Texas saying he was turning it off between messages, worried about being tracked; the couple eventually bought new phones.</p><p>They bore west, through Kansas and Oklahoma, making their way toward Mr. Felan’s family. His mother and brothers had heard about the manhunt and were sending one another worried Facebook messages. At some point, the couple exchanged cars with Mr. Felan’s mother.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Yousif’s family declined to speak in detail about what this experience has been like, and her life before she and Mr. Felan met in Minnesota and fell in love. Those who encountered Ms. Yousif as a college sophomore find the events of the past 14 months difficult to reconcile with the young woman they met in 2019. She had earned a scholarship from the American Business Women’s Association of Rochester and the woman who administered it remembered Ms. Yousif as mature and ambitious, wearing funky high heels, and chatting about her work as a bookkeeper for her father.</p><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mena Yousif at a ceremony celebrating her scholarship from the American Business Women’s Association of Rochester.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Brooke Burch</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Ms. Yousif had dreams of starting her own business. She was on the dean’s list at Rochester Community and Technical College.</p><p>And then she was on the run.</p><p>On a Friday night in mid-June 2020, a surveillance camera at a Holiday Inn outside San Antonio captured Ms. Yousif and Mr. Felan driving his mother’s brown Toyota Camry into the hotel’s parking lot. They got out of the car, walked outside the view of the camera and then disappeared.</p><p>The A.T.F. increased its reward to <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2020/062620.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$20,000</a> — $10,000 each for Mr. Felan, describing him as a “felon with multiple convictions,” and for Ms. Yousif, “his accomplice.” Mr. Felan faced a drug possession charge when he was 18 that led to an almost seven year prison sentence, and more recently, convictions for assault and for transporting undocumented immigrants near the Mexican border, for which he also spent time in prison.</p><p>The agency also released more images of them, including what appear to be their wedding photos, and warned that Ms. Yousif, “who appears to be noticeably pregnant, is known to have worn disguises while on the run, including wigs, hair extensions, hats and the absence of a hijab.”</p><p>Michael German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the Justice Department under Attorney General William P. Barr was “very aggressively” seeking to make prosecutions from the George Floyd protests. “It wouldn’t surprise me that this case would have been a high-priority one,” he said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Two weeks after officials lost track of the couple, a deputy U.S. marshal told a Texas news station that the authorities suspected they were trying to get to Mexico.</p><p>“Mena is, we believe to be, between six to eight months pregnant. We’re also taking that into consideration in our investigation,” he <a href="https://abc13.com/george-floyd-arson-fires-couple-on-the-run/6272918/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “The fact that there is an unborn child, an innocent child here involved, as well, at this point, the quicker all of this ends, for everybody’s sake, the better.”</p><p>That “innocent child” would later be separated from his parents or any family member for more than four months.</p><h2 id="link-41e3feda">Blacklisted Technology</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Illustration by Lizzie Gill; photos by the U.S. Department of Justice</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The photo projected on the screen in the conference room leapt out at him, of a woman against a pale blue background, wearing bright red lipstick and a beige hijab. Her name was next to the photo: Mena Yousif. Federico Pérez Villoro, an investigative journalist and artist based in Mexico City, wrote the name down so he could figure out who she was.</p><p>Mr. Pérez Villoro was meeting with law enforcement officials in Coahuila, Mexico last year; they were demonstrating their new equipment: facial recognition software and nearly 1,300 cameras from a Chinese company called Dahua Technology.</p><p>A group of police officers and a government employee in charge of Mexico’s first large-scale facial recognition system, Luis Campos, were explaining how the new $30 million system could flag a face so that police would get an alert in real-time if a camera spotted that person.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The authorities in Coahuila, a state that borders Texas, had bought the system in 2019; in the months since it was installed, they had searched for only about 100 people, said Mr. Campos, and he projected a few of their faces on the screen, including those of Ms. Yousif and Mr. Felan.</p><p>Mr. Campos told Mr. Pérez Villoro that the F.B.I. had learned about Coahuila’s system and asked for help finding people accused of terrorism. Mr. Pérez Villoro did his own research after the meeting.</p><p>“They were anti-racist protesters and not being searched for ‘terrorism’ in the U.S. but for acts of vandalism,” Mr. Pérez Villoro said. He was disturbed to see the technology being used that way, and mentioned it in <a href="https://quintoelab.org/project/vigilancia-biometrica-reconocimiento-facial-coahuila" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article</a> he wrote with Paloma Robles. “They just said that the F.B.I. had called Sonia Villarreal, Coahuila’s secretary of public security, with the request, a sort of informal favor, it seemed.”</p><p>Mr. German, the former F.B.I. agent who now studies civil liberty issues, said that the F.B.I. had a long history of categorizing civil disobedience as terrorism, and that the agency would likely view arson during a protest as a terrorism case. “Lighting any kind of fire at a protest is not something that’s going to be helpful to you in the eyes of the law,” he said. Mr. German also said it would not be unusual for the agency to seek help from Mexican authorities to find the couple. “There is a tremendous amount of cooperation with Mexican law enforcement on a host of law enforcement issues,” he said.</p><p>Part of what bothered Mr. Pérez Villoro was that the company that made the surveillance system, Dahua, had been blacklisted by the U.S. government in 2019. Dahua, based in Hangzhou, is one of the largest video surveillance companies in the world; it is partly state-owned, but also publicly traded, with revenues of $27 billion last year. Under the Trump administration, both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/us-to-blacklist-28-chinese-entities-over-abuses-in-xinjiang.html" title="">Commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/section889.html#:~:text=Section%20889(a)(1)(B)%20prohibits%20Executive%20agencies,of%20any%20system%2C%20or%20as" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Defense</a> departments put Dahua on blacklists as the trade war with China escalated, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-02-09/dahua-facial-recognition-china-surveillance-uighur" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as scrutiny increased</a> on human rights abuses against Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region.</p><p>According to a notice in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Register</a>, Dahua’s products were used in “China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance” against Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups. As a result, the U.S. government <a href="https://www.cov.com/-/media/files/corporate/publications/2020/07/us-government-releases-awaited-section-889-rule-on-prohibition-on-use-of-covered-telecommunications-equipment-by-federal-contractors.pdf?_ga=2.174496550.581207770.1625666607-686375869.1625666607" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cannot use its products</a> and Dahua cannot buy American goods. (American individuals and businesses still can though; Amazon bought <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its thermal cameras</a> last year to help detect Covid-19 symptoms at its warehouses.)</p><p>“Dahua Technology flatly denies the allegations,” the company said in <a href="https://us.dahuasecurity.com/?page_id=60083" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> about the blacklist. “Ultimately, no security solutions company can fully control how its technologies are used by end users.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Federal authorities declined to comment on the use of facial recognition technology in the pursuit of Mr. Felan and Ms. Yousif. “We ask for assistance with fugitive investigations from other countries every day and cannot direct which sources and methodologies they may employ to assist in fugitive investigations,” said Lynzey Donahue, spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals.</p><p>“I have not heard of a story like this before where our government asked another government to do face recognition for it,” said Adam Schwartz, a surveillance lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It’s very upsetting.”</p><p>The cutting-edge system was in use, searching for signs of the couple in Mexico, but it does not appear to be what led authorities to them. A spokeswoman for the ATF said the agency paid the $20,000 to someone who had information on the couple. “That was then used to locate Felan and Yousif while in Mexico, directly leading to their apprehension,” said Ashlee J. L. Sherrill, the spokeswoman.</p><p> In <a href="https://quintoelab.org/project/vigilancia-biometrica-reconocimiento-facial-coahuila" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his article</a>, Mr. Pérez Villoro deemed the real-time facial recognition system both an abuse of civil liberties and a technological failure that hadn’t lived up to its promise. But the technology is spreading globally, in part because China is aggressively marketing it abroad as part of the country’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/china-belt-and-road.html" title="">Belt and Road” initiative</a>, said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Center for A.I. and Digital Policy, a nonprofit in Washington.</p><p>China is marketing mass surveillance technology to its trading partners in Africa, Asia and South America, he explained, pitching it as a way to minimize crime and promote public order in major metropolitan areas.</p><p>“I don’t think they particularly see it as evil,” Mr. Rotenberg said.</p><p>In the United States, facial recognition technology is widely used by law enforcement officials, though poorly regulated. During a congressional hearing in July, lawmakers expressed surprise that<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-518.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 20 federal agencies</a> were using it without having fully assessed the risks of misuse or bias — some algorithms have been found to work less accurately on women and people of color, and it has led to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html" title=""> mistaken</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html" title=""> arrests</a>. The technology can be a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html" title=""> powerful and effective crime-solving tool</a>, though, placing it, for now, at a tipping point.</p><p>At the start of the hearing, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, highlighted the challenge for Congress — or anyone — in determining the benefits and downsides to using facial recognition: It’s not clear how well it works or how widely it’s used. As Ms. Jackson Lee said, “Information on how law enforcement agencies have adopted facial recognition technology remains underreported or nonexistent.”</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-41ae7d3e">The Arrest</h2><p>After crossing into Mexico last summer, Mr. Felan and Ms. Yousif evaded capture for months, long enough for their son to be born there.</p><p>This February, however, the day after Valentine’s Day, they were arrested in Puerto Vallarta, a tourist destination on the Pacific coast, 800 miles south of the U.S. border.</p><p>“Thanks to the skilled investigative work of the A.T.F. and the tireless apprehension efforts of the U.S. Marshals Service, these two defendants, who have been on the run for more than eight months, will be returned to Minnesota to face justice,” U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald said in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/two-rochester-fugitives-arrested-mexico-charged-arson-indictment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>.</p><p>Mr. Felan and Mr. Yousif were transported to San Diego, where they were charged in federal court — three counts of arson for Mr. Felan, which carries a possible prison sentence of 20 years, and two counts of accessory after the fact for Ms. Yousif, with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p><p>They are now back in Minnesota, forbidden from talking to each other while they await federal prosecution.</p><p>But their six-month-old son did not travel to the United States with them; he was taken into custody by Mexican authorities when the couple was arrested and placed in an “international orphanage,” according to Youser Yousif, Mena’s sister, because he was not considered a U.S. citizen. When a child is born abroad,<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/birth-abroad.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> the birth has to be </a>registered with a U.S. embassy or consulate, but that is hard to do when on the run from the law. Youser Yousif said her sister had been filling out paperwork for months trying to secure the return of her son.</p><p>In June, four months after the child was taken from his parents, Mena Yousif’s family traveled to Mexico to try to retrieve him. Ms. Yousif’s lawyer filed a request for the release of her passport, which had been seized by the authorities, so it could be sent to her parents in Mexico “to prove that the mother of the child is a U.S. citizen.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The judge agreed to the request and ordered Ms. Yousif’s probation officer to mail the passport to Mexico.</p><p>“The U.S. Marshals went to great lengths to ensure that the apprehension of this couple was handled in such a way that the child could be placed in the custody of family members,” said Ms. Donahue, spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals.</p><h2 id="link-8f5d1aa">The Fallout</h2></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A facial recognition camera, pointed at the entrance of a Rite Aid in Los Angeles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Surveillance footage and smartphone cameras provided the evidence that investigators needed to look into over <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2021/06/09/this-team-will-find-who-you-are-unrest-arson-investigators-continue-to-probe-dozens-of-cases/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 cases of arson</a> from the three days of unrest in Minneapolis. A handful of people who have been convicted so far face up to four years in prison, and have been ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution.</p><p>Video evidence was crucial, too, in the event that set off the unrest, the murder of George Floyd. It’s how the world knew what had happened to Mr. Floyd, and why Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on his neck, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for killing him.</p><p>We are living in a world where tracking technologies, from surveillance cameras to our smartphones, are recording more and more of our lives, raising urgent questions about the extent to which those recordings should feed into surveillance systems, and how easy we want it to be for governments and companies to track us in real time.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/dawn-robot-surveillance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 report on video analytics</a>, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that millions of surveillance cameras installed in recent decades are “waking up” thanks to automation, such as facial recognition technology, which allows them to not just record, but to analyze what is happening and flag what they see: “That will usher in something entirely new in the history of humanity: a society where everyone’s public movements and behavior are subject to constant and comprehensive evaluation and judgment by agents of authority — in short, a society where everyone is watched.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In this case, U.S. citizens were subject to a real-time tracking system that the U.S. government itself had deemed abusive in China.</p><p>“Real-time face recognition systems are dangerous now and threaten to become even more pervasive and all-encompassing,” said Ashley Gorski, a lawyer at the A.C.L.U. “The claimed benefits to law enforcement should not obscure the privacy harms for millions of people subject to these proliferating systems and government monitoring of their everyday movements.”</p><p>Mr. Felan is awaiting trial in Sherburne County jail on the outskirts of Minneapolis, while Ms. Yousif is on house arrest at her parents’ home in Rochester. A community group assisting people arrested as a result of the protests posted a message from Mr. Felan on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MNuprising/posts/243975254079045" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>: “This is the most difficult time I’ve ever had to go through in my entire life.”</p><p>Natalie Kitroeff<!-- -->, <!-- -->Oscar Lopez<!-- --> and <!-- -->Paul Mozur<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Susan C.

The messages — part of an ongoing pattern of social media bigotry — were condemned by politicians, platforms, teammates and fans.</p><p>They were also blamed, in part, on a familiar figure: the masked troll. He’s been popping up a lot lately. Depending who you are, he may be the source of all political disinformation; one of an army of bots; the leader of an online mob; a hacker or a scammer. He has a mascot — the guy in a hoodie at his keyboard, face obscured in the shadows, except for a little smirk. In the popular imagination, this figure, operating under a name concealed or chosen, is almost always up to no good.</p><p>That could explain why people so often push for unmasking him. In England, this episode renewed calls for tech companies to enforce identity verification for their users. A <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/575833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a> of the British government demanding that it make “verified ID a requirement for opening a social media account” has more than 688,000 signatures. “We have rights to free speech and association, but as real people, not fake people,” <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2021/07/how-end-poison-online-racism" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Paul Mason,</a> a columnist for The New Statesman.</p><p>One optimistic assumption behind these ideas is that racism is so stigmatized, people wouldn’t dare espouse such things under their own names (a curious read of politics, British or otherwise, circa 2021). It implies that to adopt a new identity is to become “fake.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But it is also pretty close to how things already work. After a decade in which online identity came under increasingly centralized control, in which various digital and offline identities were mingled, and during which personal data became a hot global commodity, control over one’s identity is starting to look more like a threatened privilege than a right. To exist online is to be constantly asked to show yourself.</p><h2 id="link-53ad0c15">Whose Space Is This?</h2><p>Online anonymity and pseudonymity have survived accusations of ruining the internet for as long as people have been logging on; they <em>have</em> been abused by bad actors. They’re also widely misunderstood.</p><p>A lot of common assumptions about anonymity are complicated by the literature on how people actually behave online, as <a href="https://coralproject.net/blog/the-real-name-fallacy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> by researcher J. Nathan Matias. In studies, for example, anonymous actors <a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/4037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tend</a> to be more, not less, sensitive to group norms. More than <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/76089/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half</a> of victims of online harassment already know their harassers. While there is scant evidence that “real name” policies mitigate abuse, there is plenty suggesting that asking people to expose more private information can intensify it. Researchers have found that, in some contexts, the most aggressive commenters have been observed to be more likely to <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155923" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reveal</a> their identities.</p><p>An analysis of nearly two decades of British press by Thais Sardá, a researcher at Loughborough University, however, found that coverage of anonymous spaces, often and imprecisely called the “dark web,” was “underpinned by a sharply negative characterization” of anonymity. When represented at all, positive uses of anonymity and pseudonymity are portrayed as narrow and exceptional; it makes sense for dissidents, for instance, but what does everyone else have to hide?</p><p>Writing in response to recent calls for the end of anonymity, the journalist Hussein Kesvani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/15/abolishing-online-anonymity-racist-abuse-id-verification?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated</a> concerns that compelling identifying information from the most vulnerable could leave them worse off. He also pointed to smaller but more universal losses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In a phone conversation, Mr. Kesvani, who recently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Follow-Me-Akhi-British-Muslims/dp/1787381250" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a book</a> on the online life of young Muslims, said his research subjects described anonymity and pseudonymity as ways to avoid the gazes of their families, to explore beyond their denominational communities and to socialize — in other words, more or less the same reasons any young person might desire privacy, online or off.</p><p>“In forums, you could be playful in your identities, but in your real world you’re constricted,” he said, recalling the internet where, and when, he came of age. The rise of universal social platforms, Mr. Kesvani said, has made a sort of privacy he took for granted growing up more scarce. “There’s this expectation that you should act online how you act offline,” he said. “Like, ‘You wouldn’t say that in the real world, why would you say that online?’”</p><p>Cassius Adair, an assistant professor at New York University and the author of a forthcoming history of transgender spaces on the internet, makes the case that conflicts over online identity disclosure are as old as the internet itself.</p><p>In the early ’90s, he said, online spaces were expanding beyond their initial military, industrial and academic roots. “In that moment a lot of people had access to the internet at work, logging in through work, and then accessing things like message boards or mailing lists,” he said. That sharply limited the range of subjects people felt able to talk about on services like Usenet. “If you’re robertjohnson@mil.gov, or tagged with your university, there are a lot of things you might not want to talk about as that person,” he said.</p><p>One early solution was to create relays — basically, trusting a third-party service to mask your information. (Think Craigslist’s <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/help/email-relay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email relay</a> for sellers.) Such services were appealing but also controversial. “There were lots of forums that split over this,” Mr. Adair said. Eventually people found, or created, more amenable spaces. “It was microcosmic,” he said, “and a type of historical evidence. Marginalized people in this time were not like, ‘Hey, protect us from anonymous trolls.’” They just wanted space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mark Pernice</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-bc532a4">A Marketplace for Identity</h2><p>What followed early, credentialed online spaces was, in retrospect, an accidental golden era of online identity construction — a widely accessible web where people adopted handles and chose email addresses, logged into chat rooms and chose their own web domains. </p></div></div><div><div><p>While most of those new identities weren’t strictly anonymous, they assumed a desire for pseudonymity. This extended to early social networks. Of course people might want to construct a new identity on Myspace, out of sight of, say, teachers or co-workers. In this context, asking why someone might say or do something online that they wouldn’t in person is as absurd as asking if they’d act the same way in front of their closest friends as they would in front of their parents.</p><p>Then came Facebook. The web had provided a multitude of spaces that could exist separately from offline social connections; Facebook, instead, began by collecting existing social networks into one big context, where disparate community norms and expectations were woven together, or maybe just thrown in a blender.</p><p>In doing so, Facebook, along with Google, reanimated power struggles that had been simmering for decades, as the researcher Danah Boyd has <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/08/04/real-names.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>. In 2014, during a push to enforce a “real name” policy across its platform, Facebook found itself directly at odds with transgender users, among many others, for whom chosen names were a condition of using the platform safely, or at all.</p><p>“Your ‘real’ name in the trans community is not your legal name,” Mr. Adair said. “You would never think that their name they use in social settings is a pseudonym.” But outside trans circles, those identities are sometimes met with suspicion. “There’s this idea that we’re de facto concealing something about ourselves,” Mr. Adair said.</p><p>And so, he said, legal names became synonymous with “safety, community, closeness and mutual accountability,” even though “it has this other side: exposure, risk, vulnerability.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The purported upsides of “real” names can be elusive. Consider QAnon, a phenomenon seeded in fringe spaces where anonymity is the norm that spread to Facebook. Its users shared so much QAnon content under their “real” names that Facebook eventually resorted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21504890/facebook-qanon-ban-conspiracy-theory-movement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blanket ban</a>.</p><p>Today, it’s hard to overstate just how thoroughly connected a typical internet user’s various identities — legal, chosen, assigned — have become. There are obvious examples in services like LinkedIn, where one’s public-facing, searchable professional identity is associated with their social identities elsewhere. Platforms that ask for legal names are woven through countless other social networks, shopping sites and commenting systems through unified login features. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html" title="">Facial-recognition technology</a> threatens to tie together all of our identities, everywhere and always. </p><p>Beneath all of this is a thriving economy of data in which you might be assigned a variety of new pseudonyms — identities readable and accessible to advertisers, data brokers and untold others, inconsistently and often ineffectively anonymized, and highly correlated with each other. It’s an internet that is less a utility than an open marketplace for identity, an environment in which disclosure is a constant condition of participation. While the centrality of identity has raised the personal stakes for users of popular social networks, people using anonymity and pseudonymity nefariously have provided cover for the platforms themselves.<span>  </span></p><p>The need for control over identity is most evident at the margins of this new economy. OnlyFans, a subscription site where people share exclusive and often explicit content, is a space where identities are concealed and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/magazine/onlyfans-porn.html" title="">constructed</a> for safety, discretion, legality and simple preference. </p><p>But it would be a mistake to assume discretion is a fringe need. Emily van Duyn, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, recently embedded with a group of progressive women in rural Texas. A combination of polarization and years of regional and social sorting had left members of the group, whom Dr. van Duyn described as “very much part of the national mainstream, but marginalized locally,” feeling worried.</p><p>“There’s a lack of anonymity in their community,” Dr. van Duyn said. “You don’t really have any.” So the group turned to discreet digital organizing. “This sort of thing helps you keep your politics and not threaten your other identities and communities and connections.” She refers to the phenomenon as “contextual marginalization,” and expects it to become more common. (A national survey conducted for her research found that 22 percent of American adults felt the need to hide political conversations from others, with no significant difference between party affiliations.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.emilyvanduyn.com/democracy-lives-in-darkness" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">title</a> of her forthcoming book based on this research? “Democracy Lives in Darkness.”</p><h2 id="link-2c290212">The End of an Era</h2><p>Many of the internet’s most powerful firms owe their success to our identities, from which they’ve extracted billions of dollars of value. Some of them, however, are showing their age. The era they defined is, if not coming to an end, colliding with changing habits. Facebook is increasingly associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/technology/why-do-older-people-love-facebook-lets-ask-my-dad.html" title="">older people</a>, many of whom joined during its experiment in “real names.”</p><p>Younger people, for the most part, have gravitated elsewhere, their pseudonyms spread across a variety of games, apps and services, some persistent, some disposable, many carefully tailored to the context in which they’re used. Discord isn’t AIM, but it’s closer in spirit to 2001 than 2021. Snapchat’s assumptions about what its users want to show people, and to whom, are miles from Instagram’s. TikTok is absolutely interested in collecting and monetizing data from its users. But even Bytedance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, knows better than to ask users for their legal names when they sign up.</p><p>Social and commercial technologies peeking over the horizon — virtual and augmented reality, persistent virtual worlds and whatever else people mean when they talk about the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html" title="">metaverse</a>” — promise new ways for people to represent themselves and connect, defaulting, mostly, to pseudonymity. But in their bold claims to being the “next internet,” they also threaten to reset the conversation around online identity once again.</p><p>The desire for semi-anonymity shares one concern: control. A troll wants control over who knows what about him; a master-of-the-universe type wants to decide what gets stuck to the family name; a young person needs a space to figure things out; an older person needs a space to change.</p><p>And yet, the desire to be different to<em> </em>different people is as familiar as family, as common as having friends and living around other people, valuable to the powerful and the weak. Who hasn’t, at some point, yearned for that kind of agency?</p><hr/><p>For Context is a column that explores the edges of digital culture.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

Google eliminated those advertisements last year after Turkish antitrust officials ordered the company to make it easier for competing shopping websites to appear more prominently in the ads.</p><p>The Turkish demands went further to crack down on Google’s shopping service than any other global regulator had to that point. But that was not all. In April, the country’s officials made another bold move, saying the company’s lucrative search function for finding local destinations like “nearby pharmacy” violated antitrust laws, a first-of-its-kind decision that threw that service’s future into question, too.</p><p>The tension between Turkey and Google reflects how growing animosity toward Silicon Valley giants is popping up even in places, like Turkey, with little history of antitrust enforcement against the industry. The efforts threaten to upend conditions — an open global internet and light-touch government regulation — that have helped fuel the growth of those companies in the past two decades. In their place could be a checkerboard of laws and regulations, where the available products and services depend on where a person logs on.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Google has been a constant target. This month, French antitrust authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/business/media/google-france-news-content-fine.html" title="">fined Google</a> 500 million euros, or $593 million, for failing to negotiate in good faith to reach a licensing deal with news publishers to use short blurbs from articles in search results. Last month, Indian competition authorities opened an investigation into claims that Google used its dominant position as owner of the Android mobile operating system to give itself an advantage in the smart-television market.</p><p>In May, Italy’s antitrust authorities fined Google €102 million for barring an electric vehicle services app from access to its Android in-car software system.</p><p>Some attribute Google’s troubles in Turkey in part to the increasingly authoritarian leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his efforts to wrest power from Western internet companies. But the pushback in Turkey and elsewhere is also prodded by Google’s rivals, such as Yelp. Those competitors have spent years lobbying regulators around the world to be tougher than authorities in the United States and Europe, the traditional powers for regulating global businesses. Sometimes, as in Turkey, the rivals work with governments whose politics they may otherwise oppose.</p><p>“Enforcers from around the world think something needs to be done, and they’re not satisfied with what the traditional centralized regimes are doing,” said Harry First, a law professor at New York University.</p><p>In the past, countries focused on domestic industries because they didn’t have the resources or the knowledge to pursue antitrust action against major international firms, said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. But as more countries take action against Big Tech, he said, a “shared intellectual infrastructure” makes it easier to pursue a case. In Turkey, the authorities leaned on European Commission findings.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The number of countries with antitrust laws has surpassed 130, up from 30 in 1990, Mr. Kovacic said.</p><p>“The Turkish experience is going to be important,” he said. “There are going to be other countries similarly situated that say, ‘Why not us?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mr. Erdogan temporarily blocked access to YouTube, which Google owns, in 2007 and 2014</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Burhan Ozbilici/Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Google, which successfully fended off some past antitrust investigations from Turkish regulators related to online advertising and search rankings, said it had removed services like the shopping ads when the changes demanded by the authorities would have made them less beneficial for users.</p><p>“We work constructively with regulators around the world and have been able to find solutions based on facts and evidence to address similar concerns, without removing features that people and businesses find helpful,” Miguel Perez Guerra, senior competition counsel for Google, said in a statement.</p><p>Google’s rivals went to Turkish regulators in 2018 after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html" title="">European Union fined Google</a> €2.42 billion, worth about $2.87 billion today, for favoring its online shopping service over rivals in search results. The fine was a record, but Google’s opponents were angry that regulators did not force the company to change its practices more. Google was still giving its shopping service preferential treatment, they said, reducing web traffic and visibility for their sites.</p></div></div><div><p>Rival services, including Kelkoo, a comparison-shopping site based in London, told Turkish officials that the European penalty had not restored competition. The rivals asked for more of an opportunity for greater visibility in Google search results, some of the internet’s most valuable real estate. The Turkish authorities complied, rejecting a more modest Google proposal.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Turkey’s decision “could have important significance in showing other regulators the way forward,” said Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ben Quinton for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The opponents said Google had then eliminated the ad boxes to avoid setting a precedent that other jurisdictions could follow, similar to the way it <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/google-to-drop-its-news-site-in-spain/" title="">dropped its news service in Spain</a> in 2014 in response to unfavorable regulation.</p><p>“The goal was very much to make sure that they could benefit from our experience in Europe and push for something better,” Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo, said of the efforts to influence Turkey. “Turkey is generally not a huge market by value, but it could have important significance in showing other regulators the way forward.”</p><p>The Turkish Competition Authority credited Google’s competitors, as well as consumer groups, for helping explain how the company unfairly used its “gatekeeper” position in search and mobile software to gain an edge in areas like shopping and local business listings.</p><p>Turkish enforcement is part of a wider push “making competition the norm in markets dominated by the big tech,” the agency said in a statement. “Our decisions are related to the efforts we are observing in the rest of the world.” The antitrust agency is also investigating Facebook’s data-sharing practices.</p><p>Turkey’s position as an important antitrust battlefield is centered on one of Google’s most important services: searches like “restaurants open near me,” which result in a box of information that links to other Google services like maps.</p><p>For years, Yelp tried unsuccessfully to get regulators in the United States, the European Union and Brazil to go after Google’s local search business, arguing that it was being unfairly cut out.</p></div></div><div><p>In 2018, not long after Turkey said it was investigating Google’s shopping service, Yelp’s head of public policy, Luther Lowe, flew to the capital, Ankara, for a meeting with antitrust officials. On a thumb drive, he provided regulators with a copy of an earlier complaint the company had filed with the European Commission, translated into Turkish, along with other evidence. His effort helped start an investigation.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar.

Google broke antitrust laws, regulators said, by displaying local search results that cut off rivals from critical internet traffic.</p><p>The resulting fine, roughly $37 million, was relatively minuscule. More important to Yelp is what could happen next: In the coming months, Google must outline remedies to include listings from competitors in local search results. If the proposed fixes do not satisfy regulators, another showdown could follow, confronting Google with a choice of offering additional changes or shutting down the service.</p><p>Given Mr. Erdogan’s history against Google’s YouTube — he temporarily blocked access in 2007 and 2014 — many question Turkey’s motivations in the antitrust cases.</p><p>The country’s antitrust agency said its actions against Google were not political, and some legal experts said they respected the regulator’s independence. But Mr. Erdogan has tightened his grip over the government bureaucracy. Last year, Turkey adopted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/turkey-social-media-control.html" title="">a law to regulate content on social media</a>, targeting YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

Your local nurse is a stripper, teacher is a stripper, babysitter is a stripper, your dog walker is a stripper,” she said. “I was tired of skipping meals.”</p><p>Now, over two years and 400,000 followers later, Ms. DuBenion, who goes by @PicassoBae, thinks of herself as TikTok’s stripper girlfriend. “You can just run to me in the dressing room whenever you’re having a rough night and just vent,” she said. “I’m like your co-worker or work wife.”</p><p>Ms. DuBenion is part of a growing community of strippers on TikTok who post under the hashtag #Striptok. Instead of gathering around a water cooler, they have built an online network to exchange professional advice, safety tips and good old-fashioned strip club gossip.</p><p>Ms. DuBenion recently made a viral TikTok advising dancers on how to strip while menstruating. She offers punchy yet practical insights, like “double up on panties.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The video had almost half a million views, and the comment section was a chorus of women doling out feminine hygiene tips. “The comment section was flooded with women giving additional advice on what worked for them whether they strip or not,” Ms. DuBenion said. “It was awesome.”</p><p>She believes that many of her female followers who watch her TikTok do not aspire to be strippers, but instead are simply women inspired by her charisma and poise. “I’ve had people message to tell me that they have this newfound confidence whether they want to strip, or in their current job, or life goals they set from themselves,” she said. “All because of the way that I speak about my own life experiences through stripping.”</p><p>Another popular StripTok user is Sky Hopscotch, 27, as she is known on social media, who on a chilly night in her home in Des Moines not long ago, flippantly tossed supplies onto a black shimmering bag and read a checklist: lingerie, makeup, baby wipes, perfume and Tylenol. In a bored, deadpan voice, she delivered each line off-camera: “Who are we kidding? The men you’re dancing on are going to sweat all over you too.”</p><p>She uploaded this tutorial with a caption: “Is your life falling apart? Can’t pay your rent? What you should bring on your first night as an exotic dancer.” The next morning, the video racked up two million views, and her account ballooned to 30,000 followers. “It was then that I started posting exclusively StripTok content,” she said.</p><p>On the platform, she has unearthed an audience eager to inherit her wisdom as a stripper: the good, the bad, the banality of men’s attention. “I discovered there was an entire community of strippers on TikTok,” she said. “A lot of women were sharing their experience as strippers: Some were educating, others were glorifying the industry. I figured, why not share my experience?”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In this enclave of the app, women congregate to document dispatches of their lives as strippers. They show off bruises from twerking, recite locker-room melodramas, boast bill counting and lament sexual harassment. In many ways, StripTok has allowed strippers to reclaim agency in their work, partly because they give advice and encouragement to one another in an industry rife with disappointment.</p><p>When she began her career 10 years ago, Sky Hopscotch was what is commonly referred to in the stripping community as a “baby stripper.” Inexperienced strippers are even more vulnerable to harassment and exploitation at the whims of bosses and customers.</p><p>“Strip club clients would single me out and request lap dances from me because they knew I was unexperienced,” she said. “They could be more handsy, cheat me out of money or try to get me to leave the club with them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Women who work as strippers are posting their experiences as a sex worker to Instagram and TikTok, using the hashtag #striptok.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Many strippers on TikTok are using their platforms with the goal of helping younger dancers avoid troubling experiences. They hope that their advice will be one step in strip clubs becoming safer and more amicable workplaces for women. “It’s vital that veteran dancers share their secrets, like hiring a bouncer to go with you to bachelor parties, so new girls in the industry don’t have to get hurt,” Sky Hopscotch said.</p><p>Under the constraint of catering to male fantasy and competitiveness, strip clubs often become an oppressive environment to strippers. The toll on mental health can be considerable. “I struggled deeply with depression, drug and alcohol addiction, eating disorders — all manners of things,” Sky Hopscotch said. “If I wasn’t pretty, if I wasn’t thin, then I would not be able to pay my bills.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>If the strip club is dominated by the male gaze, then StripTok offers viewers something else: a place where strippers are free to present as themselves. Many videos on StripTok feature strippers in states of casualness — without makeup, stretching in locker rooms, idle at home in sweatpants. Others are in oversize T-shirts counseling strippers on how to write off hair extensions as a tax deduction.</p><p>Katt, 24, a stripper living in Los Angeles, who asked to be identified only by her first name, found refuge in StripTok after feeling disillusioned by her job. She worries that the strip club teases out “the most toxic parts of myself that wants to be man pleasing.”</p><p>When she became active in the StripTok community, she began playfully experimenting with her own gender representation. “You see me in short hair, long hair, different wigs. Different looks of makeup. No makeup,” Katt said. “I feel like people are always there, hyping me up and relating to my experience without making it about what I look like. That’s really validating to me.” </p><p>Katt is Asian American and said she is overly familiar with objectification, both on and off the clock. “That’s something I’ve experienced my whole life, by every kind of man,” she said. “You see yourself in the media as the hot Asian girl or the nerdy Asian girl.”</p><p>Through her online platform, she recounts her experience of being bisexual and Asian in the stripping community, often spurring hundreds of positive comments and a network of support for other strippers from diverse backgrounds.</p></div></div><div><p>Katt, who sometimes raps along to music in her TikToks, hopes that by showing the quotidian lives of strippers, she will help humanize the profession. “You clock in for work at 7 p.m. These girls are just eating a Caesar salad, playing on their phones and talking to each other about their man troubles,” she said, joking.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Ms. DuBenion prepares for work backstage at The Red Leopard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Todd Anderson for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The interest with the interior lives of strippers on TikTok is not without precedent. “It’s because of me,” said A’Ziah King, known as Zola, in a message over Instagram. “I birthed an era and made a lane for sex workers to be vocal about their experiences and I am happy that door is now open.”</p><p>In 2015, Ms. King posted a long thread — 148 tweets — about a debauched weekend she spent stripping. Her posts were filled with enthralling details of betrayal, attempted murder, sex trafficking and friendship lost. The story trended worldwide within hours and was recently adapted into a film, “Zola,” directed by Janicza Bravo.</p><p>“I think it’s crucial for the community to share all angles and experiences within sex work, and only a sex worker can do so,” Ms. King said. “It’s important we share these experiences because it creates a safe space and sense of community.”</p><p>Despite being a reprieve from strip club bureaucracy, TikTok, like other social media sites, often censors strippers and sex workers. TikTok’s guidelines state that it “does not allow nudity, pornography or sexually explicit content.” Yet, strippers say that informational TikToks about sexual health, safety tips and general tutorials are targeted too. Ms. DuBenion had her account banned entirely and recently created a second account. StripTok posts often disappear, accounts are shadow banned, and content is removed without explanations.</p><p>This can affect livelihoods, as some strippers rely on TikTok’s Creator Fund as a second source of income during periods of financial drought at the club. Sky Hopscotch said her account is frequently deleted after educational posts about supporting sex workers. During this time, her secondary income plummets.</p></div></div><div><p>“I was making anywhere from $40 to $60 a day from the Creator Fund and then, the last three weeks, I’ve been making 96 cents a day maybe,” she said. “We have to be very careful about what we say and do on TikTok out of fear that we’ll be deplatformed.”</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Ms. DuBenion checks her iPhone at work.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Todd Anderson for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Many strippers are using their platforms to raise awareness about FOSTA-SESTA, two bills passed in 2018, broadly aimed at curbing sex trafficking online. Many sex workers feel marginalized by the bills. “This has hurt a lot of us in the community even though the intended goal was to stop sex trafficking — statistics say that it hasn’t done that at all,” Sky Hopscotch said. “It has further deplatformed people like myself.”</p><p>Through advocacy, StripTok hopes to gain momentum in raising awareness about the harmfulness of anti-sex-work legislation.</p><p>“One of the legacies of FOSTA-SESTA had been making it much more dangerous for people who engage in sex work to do so in a way that’s safer and healthier,” said Emma Llansó, the director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., dedicated to advocating individuals’ rights in technology policymaking. “There have been a lot of crackdowns on sites where people can share information about health and wellness: all different sorts of information that sex workers were really using to keep themselves safe and to be informed and to help each other.”</p><p>This censorship has spawned a mutated, hidden language on TikTok to discuss sex work. To adapt to TikTok’s policies, strippers refer to their work as “accounting” or “skripping” to camouflage themselves. “Anytime I refer to stripper, I’ll say ‘skrippa,’” Ms. DuBenion said. “Sometimes, if I write it out, I use dollar signs and an exclamation point for the I. There are things you have to finagle to make it work.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Despite the late nights and confining heels, she still loves being a stripper. She is saving the money she earns from stripping to fund a group home for people with Down syndrome, which her sister has.</p><p>“It wasn’t until recently that I started receiving donations from family, friends and even supporters across my social media platform,” Ms. DuBenion said. “I even saved all the money I made from the TikTok Creator fund to go toward a down payment on the house. I would never have thought that stripping, two and a half years ago, would have such a positive impact on my life and the lives around me.”</p><p>Ms. DuBenion recounted times when men have come into her strip club and handed her $100 bills because they’re moved by her acts of charity online. She hopes that this experience will encourage other strippers to tell their stories: express their own vulnerabilities and discontents.</p><p>“I just want everybody to see that I am a real-life person and that I do have purpose in this world,” she said. “I’m doing it for a good cause and I’m relatable. I don’t know — I’m not an object.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thousands signed a letter rebuking their employer. And even as the chief executive apologized, current and former employees said they would not stop raising a ruckus.</p><p>Shay Stein, who used to work at Activision, said it was “heartbreaking.” Lisa Welch, a former vice president, said she felt “profound disappointment.” Others took to Twitter or waved signs outside one of the company’s offices on Wednesday to share their anger.</p><p>Activision, known for its hugely popular <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/arts/video-games/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-stars-kevin-spacey.html" title="">Call of Duty</a>, World of Warcraft and StarCraft gaming franchises, has been thrown into an uproar over workplace behavior issues. The upheaval stems from <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/YJw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an explosive lawsuit</a> that California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed on July 20, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/business/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit.html" title="">accusing the $65 billion company</a> of fostering a “frat boy workplace culture” in which men joked about rape and women were routinely harassed and paid less than their male colleagues.</p><p>Activision publicly criticized the agency’s two-year investigation and allegations as “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable state bureaucrats.” But its dismissive tone angered employees, who called out the company for trying to sweep away what they said were heinous problems that had been ignored for too long.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The intense reaction was unusual. Of all the industries that have faced sexism charges in recent years — including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" title="">Hollywood</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/dining/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct.html" title="">restaurants</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/matt-lauer-today-show.html" title="">media</a> — the male-dominated video game sector has long stood out for its openly toxic behavior and lack of change. In 2014, feminist critics of the industry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/technology/gamergate-women-video-game-threats-anita-sarkeesian.html" title="">faced death threats</a> in what became known as Gamergate. Executives at the gaming companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/business/Nicolo-Laurent-Riot-Games.html" title="">Riot Games</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/technology/gaming-harassment.html" title="">Ubisoft</a> have also been accused of misconduct.</p><p>Now the actions at Activision may signal a new phase, where a critical mass of the industry’s own workers are indicating they will no longer tolerate such behavior.</p><p>“This could mean some real accountability for companies that aren’t taking care of their workers and are creating inequitable work environments where women and gender minorities are kept at the margins and abused,” said Carly Kocurek, an associate professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology who studies gender in gaming.</p><p>She said California’s lawsuit and the fallout at Activision were a “big deal” for an industry that had traditionally shrugged off claims of sexism and harassment. Other gaming companies are most likely watching the situation, she added, and considering whether they need to address their own cultures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, at an Allen &amp; Company gathering this month in Sun Valley, Idaho.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Brian Losness/Reuters</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, apologized to employees on Tuesday, saying that the responses to the lawsuit were “tone deaf” and that a law firm would investigate the company’s policies.</p></div><div><div><p>Activision, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said in a statement for this article that it was committed “to long-lasting change, listening and continuing the important work to create a safe and inclusive workplace that we can all be proud of.”</p><p>In interviews, seven current and former Activision employees said egregious behavior had taken place at the company, up and down the hierarchy, for years. Three current employees declined to be named out of fear of retaliation. Their accounts of what happened at work largely align with what is laid out in the state lawsuit.</p><p>Ms. Stein, 28, who worked at Activision from 2014 to 2017 in a customer service role, helping gamers with problems and glitches, said she had consistently been paid less than her ex-boyfriend, who joined the company at the same time she did and performed the same work.</p><p>Ms. Stein said she had once declined drugs that her manager offered at a holiday party in 2014 or 2015, which soured their relationship and hampered her career. In 2016, a manager messaged her on Facebook, suggesting she must be into “some freaky stuff” and asking what type of pornography she watched. She said she had also overheard male colleagues joking that some women had their jobs only because they performed sexual favors for male superiors.</p><p>“It was really hurtful,” Ms. Stein said, adding that she felt like she had to “endure it.”</p><p>Ms. Welch, who joined Activision in 2011 as vice president of consumer strategy and insights, said she had known that the company was reputed to have a combative culture but had been intrigued by the prominent role.</p><p>Then at a hotel on a work trip that year, Ms. Welch said, an executive pressured her to have sex with him because she “deserved to have some fun” after her boyfriend had died weeks earlier. She said she had turned him down.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other co-workers suggested she “hook up” with them, she said, and regularly commented on her appearance over the years. Ms. Welch, 52, also said she had been repeatedly passed over for promotions in favor of less qualified men.</p><p>She did not report the incidents, she said, partly because she did not want to admit to herself that her gender was a “professional liability” and she loved her work. But by 2016, she said, her doctor had persuaded her to leave because the stress was hurting her health.</p><p>Until the lawsuit came out, Ms. Welch said, she thought her experience was unique at the company. “To hear that it’s at this scale is just profoundly disappointing,” she said.</p><p>Addressing the former employees’ accusations, Activision said that “such conduct is abhorrent” and that it would investigate the claims. The company said it had distanced itself from its past and improved its culture in recent years.</p><p>California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which protects people from unlawful discrimination, said it did not comment on open investigations. But its lawsuit against Activision, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/business/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit.html" title="">spared little detail</a>. Many of the misconduct accusations focused on a division called Blizzard, which the company merged with through a deal with Vivendi Games in 2008.</p><p>The lawsuit accused Activision of being a “a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.” Employees engaged in “cube crawls” in which they got drunk and acted inappropriately toward women at work cubicles, the lawsuit said.</p><p>In one case, a female employee died by suicide during a business trip because of the sexual relationship she had been having with her male supervisor, the lawsuit said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>WINDSOR, Conn. — The town of Windsor has developed a niche in the world of warehouses and manufacturing, taking advantage of wide open spaces and crisscrossing interstates in nearby Hartford. Walgreens has a large facility here, as does Dollar Tree.</p><p>So when Amazon approached the town last year with a proposal to add a large distribution center — adding up to 1,000 jobs — local officials considered it a great opportunity.</p><p>“There are other mayors and selectmen that would give their left arm to have Amazon in their town,” Mayor Donald Trinks said in a recent interview. “It was worthy of our attention and our support of the project.”</p><p>But instead of uplifting the community of nearly 30,000 people, more than a third of whom are Black, the development has sent the town up in arms.</p></div></div><div><p>On at least four separate occasions in the past three months, workers building the Amazon warehouse found ropes that looked like nooses at the construction site. Their discoveries have set off clashes involving Black workers, racial justice activists, town officials and the numerous companies involved, raising questions about the responsibility of out-of-town companies to be responsive to local concerns as well the ability of workers to challenge people in power.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/27/business/00amazon-windsor4/merlin_190483698_6a629dad-49dd-4d22-a5c7-848d8db9242f-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/27/business/00amazon-windsor4/merlin_190483698_6a629dad-49dd-4d22-a5c7-848d8db9242f-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/27/business/00amazon-windsor4/merlin_190483698_6a629dad-49dd-4d22-a5c7-848d8db9242f-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Windsor town green and town hall, which have been the site of recent protests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Yehyun Kim for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The disagreements have spilled into coffee shops and bars, the local press and town hall meetings, generating coverage from national and international news organizations. A rally in the middle of town meant to promote unity <a href="https://www.journalinquirer.com/connecticut_and_region/protestors-hijack-rally-at-windsor-town-green-watch-video/article_dc9e53f2-cb26-11eb-bd54-cb8496ee431f.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turned instead into a shouting match</a> between the mayor and a local activist, with protesters crying out, “Who hung the noose?” Another protest by racial justice activists is planned for Saturday.</p><p>The workers and activists say their concerns about the nooses are not being taken seriously enough by many officials and the companies, including Amazon, the developer and the construction firm tied to the project. And the workers say they worry that if they speak up more, they will face retribution.</p><p>Town officials, including the police chief and the mayor, say the nooses are a serious problem. But the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have not pinned down the culprits. And some officials say the problem has been blown out of proportion by activists and the news media because of the public’s fascination with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/business/economy/amazon-faces-wider-fight-over-labor-practices.html" title="">Amazon</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Representatives for Amazon and the other companies involved say they have done everything they can, delaying construction twice, adding security and cameras at the site and putting up $100,000 in award money for anyone who can provide information about the nooses. Those are unusual steps, particularly for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/technology/amazon-new-york-politics-jobs.html" title="">Amazon, which often avoids getting caught up in local affairs</a>. The companies also say their power is somewhat limited, because there are dozens of subcontractors that have a hand in the project and are not under their direct control.</p><p>Adding to the turmoil is disagreement about even some of the most basic facts of the case, like how many nooses have been found. The N.A.A.C.P., which has held multiple news conferences in Windsor, says there were up to eight nooses. The police say two were actual nooses, while the six others were ropes with the kind of loop often used in construction projects.</p><p>“I don’t recall anything like this ever happening before,” Mr. Trinks said about his town. “I don’t know what the message is” that the perpetrators are trying to send, he said, “but it’s an offensive and disgusting statement.”</p><p>The site of the future Windsor Amazon fulfillment center — part of a huge building spree by the company — sits four miles from the center of town, near Interstate 91. It is surrounded by rolling farm fields with few buildings across the landscape, and is expected to serve the greater New York and Connecticut area.</p><p>As with many of its new warehouses, Amazon will not take ownership until the project is complete, which is expected next spring. Until then, the site is owned by Scannell Properties, a developer based in Indiana. Scannell has hired RC Andersen, a New Jersey company, to handle the construction, including hiring around three dozen subcontractors.</p><p>The steel frame of the building, which will end up standing five stories tall with 3.8 million square feet of space for Amazon goods, was rising by December.</p><p>The problems began a few months later. In late April, a local television reporter, acting on a tip, asked the town’s police chief whether his department would look into a noose found on the second floor of the rising building. The local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. was sent a similar tip as well as a photograph of the noose hanging.</p></div></div><div><div><p>By the time police officers arrived, the noose had already been taken down by the site’s safety team, said Donald Melanson, the Windsor chief of police.</p><p>Scot X. Esdaile, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., who had spoken to several Black workers about the nooses, said workers had told him that they felt the noose was taken down in an attempt to prevent the public from learning about it.</p><p>Robert Andersen, the president and owner of RC Andersen, said that was never the intention.</p><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Robert Andersen, president of the construction company RC Andersen, which is building the Amazon warehouse.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>RC Andersen</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>“We immediately contacted the police,” Mr. Andersen said. “Then from that point forward, we followed their lead on whatever we should do.”</p><p>The worker concerns grew over the next couple of days, when they found five more ropes that the police said “could be interpreted as nooses.” But the outrage really escalated two weeks later — after many people thought the problems at the site had been addressed — when workers found a seventh noose-like rope hanging from a beam.</p><p>It was “the discovery that drew the ear of many, many others that this had happened,” Chief Melanson said in an interview.</p><p>The N.A.A.C.P. held a news conference at the construction site the next day, on May 20, calling the acts “hate crimes.” The group said Amazon needed to do a better job of answering questions about what was happening at the site.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Carlos Best, a Black worker who had worked on the project until January, said during the news conference that racism at the site extended beyond the nooses. He had “personally heard racial remarks made toward my people, and other races as well,” he added. “It was a daily thing.”</p><p>Despite all the attention, workers reported an eighth noose a week later.</p><p>By that point, Amazon and Scannell had added security measures and said they were committed to holding the perpetrators accountable.</p><p>But many activists said this wasn’t enough. Keren Prescott and the Rev. Cornell Lewis, local community organizers who started groups called PowerUp CT and the Self Defense Brigade to advocate social justice, organized several demonstrations to demand that Amazon take stronger action to ensure the safety of Black construction workers. At one demonstration, Mr. Lewis, along with members from the Huey P. Newton Gun Club and the New Black Panthers, showed up at the construction site, some of them carrying guns. Mr. Lewis said the activists were there to defend the Black workers and make them feel empowered to speak their mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">“We want to have them answer some questions,” said the Rev. Cornell Lewis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Yehyun Kim for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Their anger intensified when the police made a startling statement: The department believed only two of the eight ropes were actually nooses — the first one they had investigated, and the last one.</p><p>Chief Melanson said a hangman’s noose has “a very specific knot” that tightens and “is made to withstand the strength of a human body.” He said the other ropes had a loop tied on the end that is used on construction sites for “many different reasons, like lashing down equipment.”</p><p>Ms. Prescott, the community organizer, said the police’s conclusion was “the biggest slap in the face.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Don’t make it seem as if Black people don’t work in construction,” Ms. Prescott said. “We know what typical knots and cables look like.”</p><p>Other local residents have also voiced their opposition to how the episodes at the construction site were being handled.</p><p>The nooses symbolize “one of the most detrimental issues to Black people in the United States,” Leroy Smith, a Windsor resident, said at one Town Council meeting. “To bring up that reminder, and to have this going on in 2021, is totally unjustifiable.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Windsor train station.

But he said the nooses, while serious symbols of hate, didn’t leave anyone physically harmed.</p><p>“Racism anywhere is wrong,” Chief Melanson said. “But I think it’s important to realize that there’s many other things where people are killed, and people shot, you know, with real victims.”</p><p>He added: “There’s a lot of people trying to do the right thing here, and blame needs to be placed on the people who hung the noose, not the people who are trying to stop it.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Amazon, which has met several times with the N.A.A.C.P., said it would continue to provide enhanced security and free counseling for workers at the site.</p><p>“Hate, racism or discrimination have no place in our society and are certainly not tolerated by Amazon,” said Kelly Nantel, a company spokeswoman.</p><p>Mr. Lewis, however, is not satisfied. He said that he, Ms. Prescott and other activists had asked repeatedly for a meeting with Amazon and its construction partners, and that they had yet to secure one.</p><p>If they do not get a meeting, Mr. Lewis said he and other activists would occupy the construction site.</p><p>“They need to know we’re serious,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

If the regional director rules against Amazon, the company can appeal to the labor board in Washington.</p><p>The union campaign at the warehouse, which had more than 5,000 eligible workers, was the highest-profile domestic organizing effort so far at Amazon, which has a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html" title="">aggressively deterring</a> worker activism.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The challenge by the union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, accused Amazon of engaging in unfair labor practices to keep workers from unionizing.</p><p>“Throughout the N.L.R.B. hearing, we heard compelling evidence how Amazon tried to illegally interfere with and intimidate workers as they sought to exercise their right to form a union,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the union’s president, in a statement. “We support the hearing officer’s recommendation that the N.L.R.B. set aside the election results and direct a new election.”</p><p>The union first filed paperwork for the election in November, and the voting took place by mail between early February and late March.</p><p>The union complained frequently during the campaign that the company was intimidating and threatening workers.</p><p>Amazon disputed the accusations and continues to do so. </p><p>“Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement on Monday. “Their voice should be heard above all else, and we plan to appeal to ensure that happens.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Wilma B. Liebman, who was chairwoman of the labor board under President Barack Obama, said regional directors typically followed the recommendations of hearing officers in such cases.</p><p>About one week after the labor board announced the results in April, the union filed a formal objection to the conduct of the election and asked the board to overturn it. An officer for the board held hearings over three weeks in which both sides called and questioned witnesses.</p><p>The union objection contended that Amazon consultants and employee relations managers had created an atmosphere of fear by identifying and removing workers from mandatory anti-union meetings if they questioned company officials, and by telling employees they risked losing pay, benefits or even their jobs if a union was established.</p><p>The union also contended that Amazon consultants and managers had illegally asked workers how they intended to vote, and that Amazon fired a union supporter for distributing union cards. It said the company took several measures — such as increasing pay and giving away merchandise — to defuse pressure for a union. It is <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-184/election.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">illegal to begin to take such steps</a> once a union campaign is underway.</p><p>The union objection focused heavily on an on-site collection box that Amazon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had repeatedly pushed</a> the U.S. Postal Service to install shortly before the voting began. The union said the box was not authorized by the labor relations board. Amazon has said that it pushed for the box to make it easier for employees to vote and that it did not have access to ballots that workers placed inside.</p><p>The union argued that the presence of the collection box gave workers the impression that Amazon was monitoring who voted, and possibly even how they voted. </p><p>It is not clear whether the union would improve its showing if the election were rerun. Labor law allows companies to hold frequent mandatory anti-union meetings, and Mr. Appelbaum, the retail workers’ president, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/technology/amazon-workers-against-union.html" title="">said</a> that high turnover at the warehouse was a significant obstacle to the union campaign.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They had met Mr. Musk several years ago during a private tour of <a href="https://www.spacex.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif.</p><p>A week later, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> dialed in to discuss the future of augmented reality.

Fans include Calvin Harris and Paris Hilton, and just about anyone who wants to hear tech entrepreneurs discuss cryptocurrency buyouts or the latest wrinkle in human-robot relations.</p><p>Three nights a week (the schedule is random), the roughly hourlong audiocast combines the casualness of a conference call among tech titans with the friendly small talk of happy hour. The show starts around 10 p.m. West Coast time, or whenever they’ve put Indra, their 2-year-old daughter, to bed.</p><p>Shows are live and prone to technical snafus. In an episode from January, the former Microsoft chief executive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Xy81Vt0i8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Ballmer</a> had to be reminded to mute himself because of background noise. Mr. Ballmer, it turns out, was phoning in from his hot tub. “I don’t know if you can hear the water splashing, but I have to say, it’s a pretty good way to do a discussion,” he said.</p><p>In person, Mr. Krishnan, who stands at 6-foot-6, and Ms. Ramamurthy, who is 5-foot-3, have a charmingly mismatched visual appearance. But they share the same age (both are 37) and a friendly bedside manner that allows them to make even the cagiest of chief executives feel at home.</p><p>On a crisp April afternoon in San Francisco, the couple settled into a picnic table outside <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/dining/boulangerie-revival-france-pascal-rigo.html" title="">La Boulangerie</a>, a French cafe near their house in the city’s Noe Valley neighborhood.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We’ve always been obsessed with the stories that make the people,” said Mr. Krishnan, who wore a hooded sweatshirt with the diamond logo for <a href="https://jemi.app" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jemi, a free website builder. </a>(Both are angel investors in the start-up, naturally.)</p><p>Ms. Ramamurthy, who wore an ankle-length camel coat from Comptoir des Cotonniers, nodded in agreement. “We get so many DMs and replies from people starting out their careers in India, or some other country where it’s really important to see somebody like me or Sriram,” she said. “You know, you look like me and you have an accent.”</p><p>Both were born in Chennai in South India, where they were raised in “typical middle-class Indian upbringings,” Ms. Ramamurthy said, but did not meet until 2003, when they were in college studying to become software engineers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">“When we tell people we met online, everyone thinks it’s a dating app,” Ms. Ramamurthy said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kelsey McClellan for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>A mutual friend added them to a Yahoo! chat room to help with a coding project. The collaboration fizzled, but the couple continued swapping messages despite having no idea what the other one looked like.</p><p>“When we tell people we met online, everyone thinks it’s a dating app,” Ms. Ramamurthy said with an amused sigh.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It’s a far nerdier story,” Mr. Krishnan said.</p><p>When they finally met a year later, “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, he’s so tall,” Ms. Ramamurthy said.</p><p>Not long after, the couple caught the attention of <a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/s-somasegar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S. Somasegar</a>, the storied Indian American technology executive, who was at Microsoft at the time. Impressed by the gawky digital savants, Mr. Somasegar hired them both in 2005.</p><p>“A lot of people in the industry join companies like Facebook or Twitter and are happy to be there for decades,” said Mr. Somasegar, who spent 27 years at Microsoft before joining Madrona Venture Group in 2015. “But Sriram and Aarthi are not content with the status quo. They have a restlessness that drives their curiosity and a need to ask questions.”</p><p>The pair became romantically involved in 2006. The following year, they relocated to Microsoft’s American headquarters in Seattle. They eloped in 2010 and moved to Palo Alto a year later.</p><p>Mr. Krishnan went on to hold managerial positions at Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook and Snap. Earlier this year, he was hired as a general partner at the powerful venture capital firm <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/03/sriram-krishnan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, one of Clubhouse’s lead investors. “When I meet founders now, they feel like they already ‘know’ me from listening to the show, and that really helps,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Ramamurthy worked at Netflix before introducing two start-ups: <a href="https://trueandco.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">True and Co.</a>, a lingerie e-commerce site in 2012; and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lumoid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lumoid</a>, a service that allows people to try gadgets before buying. She went to Facebook in 2017 as a product director before leaving in May to head up Clubhouse’s efforts to expand to other countries. As with Clubhouse’s other 40 employees, she will receive equity.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Clubhouse now enjoys a market valuation of $4 billion, but its metrics fluctuate wildly. At its peak in February, it had about 10 million global downloads, according to the app analytics firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/news-feed/clubhouse-surpasses-10-million-installs-globally-from-the-app-store-alone/602fd41b9faa19397c8ebed4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sensor Tower</a>, largely thanks to the appearances by Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg on “The Good Time Show.” That number nose-dived <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clubhouse-downloads-900000-in-april-2021-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to around 900,000 downloads in April </a>— a free-fall of about 90 percent. The release of an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/clubhouse-has-million-more-on-wait-list-after-android-launch-ceo.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a> version in May helped reverse the slide, with around seven million downloads in June, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/android/in/alpha-exploration-co/app/clubhouse-the-social-audio-app/com.clubhouse.app/overview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sensor Tower</a>.</p><p>The couple are not concerned about headlines declaring that “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Clubhouse party is over</a>” or competition from companies like Spotify, which recently announced its own live audio hub, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/greenroom/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greenroom</a>.</p><p>“If you look at Facebook from 16 years ago or Twitter from 12 years ago, those platforms are going to be unrecognizable from today,” Ms. Ramamurthy said between sips of tea. “Clubhouse is just one year old. I have so much faith in the platform that I literally left my job to work there.”</p><p>The couple have always been technology’s true believers. Mr. Krishnan recounted that “big weekend activities” often entailed walking around <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Park</a> or taking nosy jogs by the Tudor-style home once belonging to <a href="https://pursuitist.com/steve-jobs-home-in-palo-alto/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>“We would do a few laps around his house — I’m sure people thought we were sick,” Ms. Ramamurthy said, appearing slightly mortified.</p><p>With a big smile, Mr. Krishnan placed his hand on his wife’s shoulder. “We really have been fanboys forever,” he said. “What else can we say? We just love tech.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

This was in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, a vast area about an hour northwest of Las Vegas where the American military tested bombs. I was working for EG&amp;G, a military contracting company that, among other atomic chores, supplied all the instrumentation for the test site; it is now part of a company called Amentum. My job, to study the effects of nuclear explosions on the atmosphere, was sufficient to keep me out of the Vietnam War draft.</p><p>Cabriolet, as the test was called, contained the force of 2,300 tons of TNT. Detonated hundreds of feet underground, it was louder than I thought anything could ever be. The ground bulged, and a line of torches marking ground zero flew into the air. From a shaking trailer four miles away, my boss and I filmed tongues of fire erupting from the earth and congealing into an elephant-shaped cloud of dust that drifted off in the general direction of Montana.</p><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The author’s pass to the Nevada Test Site, circa 1968.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>via Dennis Overbye</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Those were heady days in the atomic business, when people thought they could build harbors in a few microseconds of fury, or dig a new Panama Canal overnight in a domino of blasts, or even propel spaceships. Cabriolet was part of the Plowshare Program, which looked for peaceful civilian uses of nuclear explosions. Turns out all they are good for is terror.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-2c69cf35">Where it all began</h2><p>Twice a year, on the first Saturdays of April and October, the U.S. Army opens the gate to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, allowing in civilians to tour a patch of sand known as the Trinity Site, where the very first atomic explosion was set off and the history of nuclear dread began. It was so named by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project to build the bomb, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44106/holy-sonnets-batter-my-heart-three-persond-god" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inspired by lines like these in the poems of John Donne</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Batter my heart, three-person’d God, for you</em></p><p><em>As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;</em></p><p><em>That I may rise and stand, o’erthrow me, and bend</em></p><p><em>Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.</em></p></blockquote><p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsmr.army.mil/Trinity/Pages/Home.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trinity website</a>, the Stallion Gate would open promptly at 8 a.m.; when we arrived not long after the crack of dawn, a four-mile-long caravan of cars was ahead of us. The idea to visit came from Michael Turner, an old friend and cosmologist recently retired from the University of Chicago and now with the Kavli Foundation in Los Angeles.</p><p>Dr. Turner had grown up under the Promethean promise of that mushroom cloud and 20th-century science. Everybody who was anybody in physics had worked on the Manhattan Project. As a young physicist in the 1960s and ’70s, Dr. Turner was part of a young band of physicists who invaded astronomy and turned cosmology into particle physics or perhaps vice versa. He had never visited the Trinity Site — he hadn’t known you could go there until recently, he said. And being open only two days a year presented a logistical challenge.</p><p>He brought along an old pal from his undergraduate days at the California Institute of Technology, Robert J. Miller, who had helped invent the computer touch pad. Because visiting day coincided with the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta the hotels were full, and the three of us had to share a single room. I don’t remember who paid for the room; I paid for the rental car. Nobody snored.</p><p>Once inside the gate, we drove for a half-hour, past desert hills dotted with radar and telescope domes, to a dusty parking lot manned by fresh-faced young men in Army camo fatigues. A line of port-a-potties occupied one corner of the lot, arrayed as if for an outdoor rock concert.</p></div></div><div><p>The first thing on display was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX0e0vSVMac" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Jumbo</a>, a steel barrel 12 feet or so wide with walls as much as 16 inches thick; it rested on its side like a culvert, allowing visitors to walk through. The original plan was to detonate the Gadget — the Manhattan Project physicists’ term for the bomb — inside the Jumbo. If the bomb fizzled, the Jumbo would <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2008/AndrewMorel.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corral the $250 million worth of plutonium</a> that was the explosive core of the device.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The physicist Norris Bradbury with the Gadget at the Trinity Site in July 1945.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>United States Department of Energy</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The author at ground zero.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dennis Overbye</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">An old observation tower for instruments at the McDonald ranch, two miles from ground zero.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dennis Overbye</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>We continued through a gate and down a path lined with barbed wire, Keep Out signs and warnings about rattlesnakes, to a fenced-in area littered with glassy gravel, sand and tufts of sagebrush and sparse grass. It was here at 5:29:45 a.m. on July 16, 1945, that arguably the most consequential physics experiment of the 20th century took place.</p><p>The bomb would use explosives to squeeze a softball-size lump of plutonium to critical density, ideally resulting in a soul-rattling explosion. It worked, lighting up the New Mexico landscape a few minutes before dawn and causing Dr. Oppenheimer to mutter to himself a verse from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds.”</p><p>Three weeks later, on Aug. 6, 1945, a bomb of slightly different design was dropped on Hiroshima, killing an estimated 140,000 people. It shot two hunks of uranium together, creating the critical mass needed for a chain reaction to occur; scientists were so certain the design would work that they did not even bother testing it before it was deployed. Fat Man, a plutonium bomb of the kind tested at Trinity, was used on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, and the end of World War II soon followed.</p><h2 id="link-7e7ecc21">Trinkets of the Apocalypse</h2><p>At Trinity’s ground zero, hundreds of people were milling around as if at a county fair, but there was little to see. The detonation created a crater eight feet deep, a half-mile wide and lined with glassy pebbles called trinitite: sand that had been swept up in the fireball, vaporized and then fell back down in molten radioactive droplets. But gradually the pebbles were shoveled out and the hole filled with scrubby sand, weeds and rocks. Now display stands sold snacks and souvenirs; at one table, docents were using a Geiger counter to show off mildly radioactive rocks.</p><p>The Gadget was detonated atop a 100-foot tower. All that remained was an inch-long stub of metal sticking out of the ground. An obelisk of black rocks, with a plaque commemorating the event, marked the exact point of ground zero; we took turns posing in front of it and a life-size model of Fat Man, which resembled a short, bulbous submarine with enormous tail fins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Jumbo device in 1945.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Science History Images/Alamy</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Michael Turner of the Kavli Foundation holding a piece of what might be Trinitite.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dennis Overbye</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Robert Miller, inside the present-day remains of the Jumbo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Dennis Overbye</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>The ground below our feet was littered with green shards of trinitite. They were allegedly radioactive, and signs warned that removing any stones constituted theft of government property and could lead to fines or even jail time.</p><p>The signs seemed to remind visitors to bend down and retie their shoelaces, perhaps to gather a promising souvenir or two of the original sin in the process. Some days later, in an email, Dr. Turner wrote that his piece of trinitite “has a proud place in my rare gem collection, kept two meters away from me (for radioactive safety. :-).”</p><p>Any such caution was unnecessary for me. On returning home, I took my bounty of trinitite to the office and gave it to a colleague whose spouse taught chemistry and had access to a Geiger counter. I was hoping that my pebbles would be at least as radioactive as a banana, but my friend’s verdict came the next day. “Pathetic,” he said.</p><p>Two miles away, amid the scrubby brush and sand and accessible by a bus ride, was a property known as the McDonald Ranch. It was in the main bedroom of the ranch house that the youngsters who would become the physics elders of Dr. Turner’s generation gingerly finished assembling the Gadget, inserting the plutonium core.</p><p>In their down time they went swimming in a cistern that had held water for the horses and other animals. Rising above the sagebrush was a wooden observation tower looking lonely and ancient against the blue sky, keeping a rustic vigil on the past.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6c71a1a1">An emerging history of near-misses</h2><p>There are now <a href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 13,000 nuclear warheads on Earth</a>, according to a recent compilation by the Federation of American Scientists. Perhaps miraculously, not one has been detonated in anger since 1945, although stories keep emerging of close calls.</p><p>Recently it was revealed that when the Chinese Communists seemed to be threatening Taiwan in 1958, the American military drew up plans to bomb mainland China. Another near-tragedy occurred on Sept. 26, 1983, three weeks after Soviet fighters had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/stanislav-petrov-nuclear-war-dead.html" title="">Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces</a>, was in charge that day of a command center called Oko (“eye,” in Russian), an early-warning system that relied on a network of satellites to detect attacks. The system reported that a half-dozen missiles had been launched from the United States and were headed toward the Soviet Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Colonel Stanislav Petrov in 2004.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Tom Parfitt/South China Morning Post, via Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Colonel Petrov’s task was to relay the warning to his superiors in Moscow, who were likely to order a retaliatory strike. But Colonel Petrov, an engineer by training, held back, worried that the signal might be a false alarm. Several tense minutes in the early-warning command center passed by until finally ground-based radar confirmed that no missiles were incoming. The error was later traced to unusual reflections from high-altitude clouds.</p><p>Colonel Petrov was later reprimanded for insufficiently documenting his work on that day. To the rest of the world he was a hero. In 2006 he was invited to address the United Nations and tour the United States, a trip that was documented in a film, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/movies/review-the-man-who-saved-the-world-recounts-a-cold-war-near-miss.html" title="">The Man Who Saved the World</a>.”</p><p>In the course of his United Nations visit, he visited a Minuteman missile silo and its deactivated missile.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Wow,” the former Soviet colonel says in the film. “You’re beautiful.”</p><p>Then his guide, a friendly young man, begins to explain that, according to policy, the weapon would have been launched only in response to a Soviet attack. Colonel Petrov erupts. “Brainless goat,” he says. “We were doing the same thing. We weren’t creating weapons to attack you, we were creating them for defense.”</p><p>Asked if atomic bombs would ever be used in war again, Colonel Petrov pauses. “I think so,” he says. “It’s absurd.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

This might feel like old news. Tech’s Titanic 5 have been big and rich for a long time, and they’ve gotten even more so as people and organizations have needed their products during the coronavirus pandemic. Yadda, yadda, yadda. We get it.</p><p>But no, we really don’t get it. American’s technology superstars have launched into a completely different stratosphere than even other wildly successful companies in tech and beyond.</p><p>Let me give you a flavor of the bonkers-ness:</p><ul><li><p>The current stock market value of the Big Five ($9.3 trillion) is more than the value of <em>the next 27</em> most valuable U.S. companies put together, including corporate giants like Tesla, Walmart and JPMorgan Chase, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/apple-q3-earnings.html" title="">Apple’s profit</a> just from the past three months ($21.7 billion) was nearly double the combined annual profits of the five largest U.S. airlines in prepandemic 2019.</p></li><li><p>Amazon’s stock price increases have made Jeff Bezos<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=Qk91czAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> so rich</a> that he could buy a new model iPhone for 200 million people — and he would still be a billionaire.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/technology/alphabet-google-q2-earnings.html" title="">Google’s $50 billion in revenue</a> from selling advertisements from April to June was about what Americans — <em>all of the Americans</em> —<a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> spent on gasoline</a> and gas station purchases last month.</p></li><li><p>The annual revenue of one of Microsoft’s side businesses, LinkedIn, is nearly four times that of Zoom Video Communications, a star of the pandemic, in the past year.</p></li><li><p>Facebook expects to dole out more cash outfitting its computer hubs and offices in 2021 than Exxon spends around the world to dig oil and gas out of the ground in a year.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/amazon-q2-earnings-profit.html" title="">Amazon</a> fell short of investors’ expectations on Thursday. But in the past year, Amazon’s e-commerce revenue still climbed by $109 billion — an increase in a single year that Walmart needed the past nine years to reach.</p></li></ul><p>I know that lots of odd things are happening in the U.S. economy right now. But I cannot adequately explain how not normal these numbers are from the tech superpowers. Maybe that’s why Bezos wanted<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/science/jeff-bezos-astronaut-definition.html" title=""> to touch outer space;</a> the Big 5 tech giants have outgrown Earth.</p></div></div><div><div><p>What’s clear more than ever is that America’s tech titans have formed a separate universe in which they are the sun, and everyone else — billions of humans, other companies, entire countries and governments — are mere planets that revolve around them.</p><p>Perhaps even more surprising than the size and scale of these companies is how they have mostly grown more profitable in what could or should have been economic conditions that hurt their profits.</p><p>I have been befuddled that Amazon and Apple have shown higher profit margins than those companies have had for years — possibly ever. That has happened even though the pandemic has forced those companies to reorganize factories or warehouses, deal with disrupted global shipping, scramble for parts in short supply and spend a fortune to keep their workers safe.</p><p>That chaos and unplanned spending should have made the companies less profitable, not more so. (Apple did spook investors a little by saying this week that it was having trouble getting all the parts it needs for the next few months.)</p><p>What does all this mean? Well, for one thing, members of Congress or state attorneys general might look at the numbers and ask: If, as the Big Tech companies say, they face stiff competition and could die at any moment, how could profit margins keep going up like this?</p></div></div><div><div><p>Logic would suggest that if the companies are fighting off lots of rivals, they might have to cut prices and profit margins would shrink. So<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/facebook-q2-earnings.html" title=""> how does Facebook</a> turn each dollar of revenue, nearly all from ads it sells, into 43 cents of profit — a level that most companies can only dream of, and higher than Facebook posted before the pandemic?</p><p>I’ve asked over and over in this newsletter whether America’s Big 5 tech titans are invincible. As the gap keeps widening between the super rich tech superstars and the merely super, I’m starting to believe that the answer is yes.</p><hr/><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Every country wants to regulate Big Tech: </strong>Turkey has forced Google to make major changes to its search engine in the country.

But they have also been decisive trend setters in keeping their workers and the rest of us safer from the virus.</p><p>Last year, some high-profile tech companies were relatively early to close their corporate offices as coronavirus outbreaks started in the United States, and they continued to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/silicon-valley-s-blue-collar-workers-remain-edge-months-pandemic-n1247444" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pay many hourly workers</a> who couldn’t do their jobs remotely. Those actions from companies including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/technology/microsoft-coronavirus-response.html" title="">Microsoft</a>, Salesforce, Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-04-22/how-tech-s-empty-offices-helped-san-francisco-bend-the-curve-k9b7nj3b?sref=Qk91czAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">probably helped save lives in the Bay Area</a> and perhaps beyond.</p><p>Now many of the same tech companies — along with schools and <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/health/covid-vaccine-hospitals.html" title="">health care institutions</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/biden-vaccine-mandates.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">some government</a> employers in the United States — have started to announce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/google-return-to-office-masks.html" title="">vaccine mandates for staff</a>, the resumption of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/technology/apple-return-to-office-delay.html" title="">requirements to wear masks</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/23/business/return-to-office-vaccine-mandates-delta-variant.html" title="">delayed reopenings of offices</a> or <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-begins-on-site-covid-19-vaccinations-for-front-line-employees" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on-site workplace vaccinations </a>to help slow the latest wave of infections.</p><p>America’s tech companies, which deserve criticism for misusing their power, also should get credit for using their power to take decisive action in response to virus risks.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Those steps helped make it palatable for other organizations to follow. And in some cases, tech companies have acted more quickly in response to health threats and communicated about them more effectively than federal or local government leaders.</p><p>I get that readers will disagree over whether employers should require vaccinations or other health measures. I also get that tech companies have many advantages over other kinds of employers, including workers who can largely do their jobs away from an office. Companies that manufacture cars or airplanes, serve food or run hospitals don’t have that luxury.</p><p>And tech companies based in left-leaning parts of the United States including the Bay Area and Seattle are less likely to encounter backlash from staff or local politicians for requiring vaccinations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/big-tech-profits.html" title="">Having infinite dollars</a> also gives tech companies the ability to do what they believe is best.</p><p>But other affluent corporations mostly haven’t been as visible in leading the way for how large employers should aid in the country’s pandemic response.</p><p>Technology companies cannot and should not replace effective government. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/upshot/coronavirus-capitalism-vaccine.html" title="">collaboration of private industry and the U.S. government</a> was instrumental in the development and delivery of extremely effective vaccines, and it was the federal government’s actions that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/us/politics/covid-poverty-aid-programs.html" title="">significantly reduced poverty in America</a> in a time of crisis.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It’s appropriate to worry that tech superpowers and other private companies have too much influence. But in this case, technology companies have been flexing their might to make us all a little safer.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>A MeToo reckoning in video games: </strong>Many employees of the video game company Activision Blizzard are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/activision-walkout-metoo-call-of-duty.html" title="">protesting</a> what they say is routine workplace harassment and unfair pay for women.

Everyone was posting. They seemed a little stressed, but that’s normal. The Greenwich Mean fights were dispersing. Eastern Standard discourses were shuffling into formation. Main character auditions were underway. All of the little mixed-metaphor icons — the birdhouse, the magnifying glass, the bell, the envelope, the quill (?) with a plus sign (??) — seemed to be in order.</p><p>Everything was in its right place. That’s what had changed. Fleets — those disappearing posts, presented in bubbles, that resembled Instagram and Snapchat Stories — were permanently gone.</p><p>In July, Twitter announced that the feature, which rolled out publicly in November 2020, would disappear on Aug. 3. “We built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting,” the company said. Though that isn’t usually understood to be Twitter’s main problem, the company decided that, after seeing little increase in people “joining the conversation,” it would shelve the feature.</p><p>Aside from the implication that Fleets were something other than an attempt to incorporate a competitor&#39;s feature in the hopes of increasing engagement, the announcement was unusually frank. <em>We tried! Users didn’t use. Lessons learned. Better luck next time, to us.</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>But as anyone who uses Twitter knows, recalcitrance reigns.</p><p>Twitter is influential. It’s also relatively small. Its user base is just a fraction of Facebook’s, YouTube’s, TikTok’s or Instagram’s. The company reports substantially fewer users than Snapchat and slightly fewer than Reddit. It’s the least-used social network that everyone knows about, seemingly talked about more than it’s talked on.</p><p>Twitter’s situation would seem more bizarre if hadn’t been this way for so long. Its stagnant-to-slow growth, its incremental approach to adding new features and its adherence to formal limitation would be deemed intolerable or absurd in other corporate contexts. In 2005, nobody could have guessed what Facebook would become. Show 2021 Twitter to a time-traveling 2007 Twitter user, though, and they wouldn’t likely have many questions — at least not about the platform itself.</p><p>When Twitter has committed to major change, it has done so in a gradual, piecemeal fashion, experimenting with capabilities outside its main app before integrating them (see: Periscope, Vine). It took more than a decade to get from 140 to 280 characters. When new big-deal features stick around — live video, for example — they remain subordinate to the core experience.</p><p>This slow process can leave users feeling unheard, or a bit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/style/social-media-stuck.html" title="">stuck</a>. The platform’s history, however, is uniquely bound up with their participation.</p><p>In “Twitter: A Biography,” Jean Burgess and Nancy K. Baym describe Twitter’s product as we know it today as a result of “a set of conventions” that “emerged through user experimentation.” Early adopters, in other words, came up with ways to get more out of Twitter’s primitive feed — an @ symbol, a hashtag, the RT — and then Twitter turned those practices into features. </p></div></div><div><p>That Twitter’s users come up with its core capabilities is both well known and ongoing — quote tweets and threads are more recent examples — but it misses half the story. Some of the other social platforms can feel like massive experiments, where users are subjected, with varying degrees of awareness, to constant tests. A button is there one day, and not the next. You’re nudged between news and then live video and then chats and then Groups.</p></div><div><div><p>Twitter, by contrast, when it’s not recognizing and sanctioning new habits — not all of them good for the community — is more often in the position of merely applying a brake, or fiddling with a knob that turns between “Less Twitter” and “More Twitter,” with “Twitter” defined not by Twitter itself, but by hundreds of millions of people who will simply not log off, lest they lose their chance to see or be seen in the One True Feed.</p><p>Part of this comes down to how Twitter works, on a basic level. “Twitter has preserved an architecture for publics to emerge around any issue, including how Twitter works,” said Prof. Burgess, who works in the digital media research center at the Queensland University of Technology. “It makes it difficult for the company to institute any major changes because there’s this really active mobilized user community,” particularly, she said, “when they don’t seem to emerge out of user practices or norms, and seem to just mimic features of other platforms three years later.”</p><p>In their book, Prof. Burgess and Prof. Baym suggest that, for nearly a decade now, Twitter has been in transition away from its “open innovation” paradigm — the one where Twitter, awed by its users, turns the knob toward “More Twitter” — and into a terminally advertising-driven one, where “user metrics need to be contained and controlled.” If an openly top-down Twitter can’t work, in other words, the company can at least make sure it’s monetized.</p><p>Twitter, of course, can do whatever it wants. It’s frequently humbled by its collective users, but it frequently disappoints them, too. (In some contexts, “more Twitter” equates with harassment.) It’s also a profitable company that extracts billions of dollars from this process; what Twitter users insist on doing, collectively, isn’t actually an awesome mystery, it’s just surprisingly specific and, it turns out, extremely sticky.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Still, it’s at least a little bit gratifying to find parallels between Twitter the company and its most devoted and conflicted users, who are constantly coming to terms with the limits of their autonomy within the cascade. Twitter never really changes; instead, it keeps becoming more itself, and all the company can do is decide how far to let that go. The crowd doesn’t exactly run things, bit its presence is what makes the whole undertaking worthwhile, so it must be heeded. Sound familiar? (If not, congratulations on your healthy relationship to posting.)</p><p>Twitter, like each of its users, has two options for the long term: double down or draw back. Any attempt at a third way will never be more than fleeting.</p><hr/><p>For Context is a column that explores the edges of digital culture.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

If the coalition is successful, Massachusetts voters will decide next year whether gig workers should be considered independent contractors.</p><p>The employment classification of gig workers has been the subject of legal battles in several states. Labor activists argue that companies like Uber do not pay fair wages to their workers and shortchange them on expenses, health care and unemployment benefits. The companies say their workers enjoy too much flexibility to be considered employees. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/technology/massachusetts-sues-uber-lyft.html" title="">Massachusetts sued Uber and Lyft</a>, claiming they misclassified drivers as independent contractors. That litigation is ongoing.</p><p>The group of gig companies, called the Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, proposes exempting gig workers from being classified as employees but offering them some limited benefits, including minimum pay of $18 per hour spent transporting a rider or delivering food.</p><p>“This is the best of both worlds,” Pam Bennett, a DoorDash courier, said in a statement provided by the coalition. “This measure will help every driver by preserving our ability to work whenever and however we want, and also give us access to brand-new benefits that will really help.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The ballot proposal mirrors an initiative that the companies proposed last year in California. The companies poured $200 million into the California ballot initiative, making it the most expensive effort in state history, and ultimately prevailed in exempting their workers from a California law that would have effectively classified them as employees.</p><p>“They are going to try to get this ballot measure by deceiving the public into thinking that this is somehow for the benefit of the workers,” said Shannon Liss-Riordan, a labor attorney who represents gig workers in Massachusetts. “It’s going to take away their responsibilities under Massachusetts law and substitute these fake benefits.”</p><p>The effort in Massachusetts comes as Uber and other companies that rely on gig workers face increased scrutiny from the Biden administration,<strong> </strong>which earlier<strong> </strong>this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/11/business/stock-market-today#the-labor-department-moves-to-undo-trump-era-rules-weakening-worker-protections" title="">rolled back a Trump-era rule</a> that would likely have classified gig workers as independent contractors.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT" title=""><em>sign up here</em></a><em> to receive it weekdays.</em></p><p>An all-you-can-eat buffet can be glorious. (Uh, at least before Covid-19.) Pay a single price and get options to tuck into roast beef, pizza, green beans, a chocolate fountain and more. It’s gluttony made easy.</p><p>Many of the subscriptions to digital services work the same way. Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime typically charge one fee for access to a collection of goodies.</p><p>There are signs, however, that the all-you-can-eat digital subscriptions are becoming more nuanced. Some companies including Disney and Whole Foods, the grocery chain that is owned by Amazon, are charging subscribers more for compelling extras. Others including Spotify and YouTube are experimenting with subscriptions that cost less but come with compromises. Both strategies may show that the endless digital buffet is changing for good.</p><p>I don’t know whether the subscription strategies will stick, or how we might respond to having more choices. Maybe you’d like the option to pay less at the buffet because you always skip dessert or to pay a little more for filet mignon. Or it could ruin the simple appeal of the buffet.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Either way, we should get used to more experiments. This week, The Verge reported that both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607203/spotify-plus-ad-supported-tier-unlimited-skips-on-demand-listening" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and YouTube are trying out lower-priced subscription offers with limitations. YouTube, which charges $12 a month in the United States for its video and music service without commercial breaks, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605455/youtube-premium-lite-pilot-benelux-nordics-experiment-ad-free-subscription" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testing an offer in some European countries</a> at less than half the usual rate. This offer excludes some of the typical features that paying customers receive, including the ability to download a video for later when you won’t have an internet connection. Spotify is also experimenting with a limited offering for as low as 99 cents a month compared with a typical $10 monthly subscription.</p><p>Disney is going the other way by charging extra to Disney+ streaming subscribers who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/business/black-widow-theaters-streaming.html" title="">want to watch at home some of its newly released movies</a>. Bloomberg News reported this week that Whole Foods is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/amazon-s-whole-foods-tacks-on-delivery-fee-in-some-u-s-cities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testing a $9.95 delivery fee</a> in some U.S. cities. Until now, both Whole Foods and Amazon’s Fresh grocery service have mostly not charged an additional delivery fee to Prime members. (Fresh will apparently not require a separate delivery fee. I don’t get it, either.)</p><p>Many of the all-you-can-eat digital subscription services are a little nuanced already, with higher prices for households with more devices and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/netflix-tests-new-low-cost-subscription-plan-in-india/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less expensive subscriptions with limitations</a> in some lower-income countries.</p><p>Mostly, though, these companies have a relatively straightforward proposition of a single price for everything that they offer. And there are potential risks when companies shift away from the all-you-can-eat model. People who already pay for Prime or Disney+ might feel ripped off when they’re asked to pay even more. Lower-cost subscription options might entice users who had been paying full price.</p><p>One of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/technology/no-the-best-doesnt-win.html" title="">overlooked superpowers</a> is that there’s (mostly) just one version, without add-ons for sports or new-release movies, or different prices with and without commercials. The simplicity of a single subscription offer removes the need to evaluate a bunch of options before deciding to sign up.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But the advantage of adding more subscription permutations is they might offer more people what they want. I don’t pay for a subscription to Spotify, but I might be tempted if I could pay a little less even if I don’t get all the goodies of full paying members. I could also imagine that an electronica fan might like a cheaper Spotify subscription that includes only the music that he’s likely to listen to.</p><p>It can feel as if online subscriptions have been around forever, but they’re a relatively new and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/technology/google-and-facebook-killed-free.html" title="">still evolving</a> feature of online life. I’m still not sold that subscriptions to everything are the best path, for either our wallets or the companies and people trying to earn a living online. </p><p>But it makes sense that subscription offers will start to fragment because not everyone wants the same thing. We might get more of exactly what we want, and we may come to miss the gluttony made simple.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Humanity’s collective power is needed to fix our biggest problems. </strong>But my Opinion colleague Farhad Manjoo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/opinion/technology-internet-cooperation.html" title="">asks</a>, “What if humanity’s capacity to cooperate has been undone by the very technology we thought would bring us all together?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-driving cars aren’t mainstream, but they’ve already changed the labor market: </strong>Rest of World looks at <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/self-driving-cars-outsourcing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how outsourced work has been altered </a>as fleets of people in lower-income countries are training software to think more like human drivers — and that includes tasks such as labeling digital images of drops of water.

But challenges to the company’s labor practices are growing quickly, too.</p><p>Those challenges were underscored when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/business/amazon-union-alabama-nlrb.html" title="">a hearing officer for the National Labor Relations Board recommended</a> a new union election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/amazon-defeats-union.html" title="">at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama</a>, saying the company’s conduct during the organizing campaign had precluded a fair vote.</p><p>The board’s regional office will rule on the recommendation in the coming weeks. If it leads to a new election, as seems likely, the union would face long odds of victory. But Amazon faces a widening campaign to rein in the power it wields over its employees and their workplace conditions.</p><p>Those efforts include a campaign by the Teamsters that would generally circumvent traditional workplace elections and pressure the company through protests, boycotts and even fights against its expansion efforts at the local level. Legislation in California would force Amazon to reveal its productivity quotas, which unions contend are onerous and put workers at risk.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Amazon warehouse workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html" title="">have protested</a> what they consider unsafe conditions, sometimes resulting in embarrassment for the company, as with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the disclosure of notes from an internal meeting</a> in which an Amazon executive called a worker-turned-protester “not smart, or articulate.”</p><p>In April, the general counsel of the labor board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html" title="">found merit to charges</a> that Amazon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/business/stock-market-covid-coronavirus.html#link-b8bac86" title="">fired two white-collar workers</a> who had raised concerns last year about the conditions facing the company’s warehouse workers during the pandemic. </p><p>The election in Alabama brought intense scrutiny of the company’s labor practices, with even President Biden taking it as an opportunity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/business/economy/joe-biden-unions.html" title="">to warn employers</a> that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda” during such a campaign.</p><p>In a statement after the hearing officer’s recommendation was reported on Monday, Amazon said, “Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers.”</p><p>Since the results were announced in early April, showing that Amazon won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/amazon-defeats-union.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">more than two to one</a>, many unions and union supporters have argued that the outcome points to the need for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/business/economy/amazon-labor-unions.html" title="">new tactics</a> to organize the company.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Perhaps the most prominent voice in this discussion is the more than one-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which approved a resolution <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/business/economy/amazon-union-teamsters.html" title="">at its convention in June</a> committing the union to “supply all resources necessary” to organize workers at the company and help them win a union contract.</p><p>The Teamsters argue that holding union votes at individual work sites is typically futile at a company like Amazon, because labor law allows employers to wage aggressive anti-union campaigns, and because high turnover means union supporters often leave the company before they have a chance to vote.</p><p>Instead, the Teamsters favor a combination of tactics like strikes, protests and boycotts that pressure the company to come to the bargaining table and negotiate a contract covering wages, benefits and working conditions. While the union hasn’t laid out its tactics in detail, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/terminal-at-port-of-la-impacted-by-truck-driver-strike/2573504/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it recently organized</a> walkouts involving drivers and dockworkers at a port in Southern California to protest the drivers’ treatment there.</p><p>They hope to enlist the help of workers at other companies, sympathetic consumers and even local businesses threatened by a giant like Amazon, partly to mitigate the challenges presented by high employee turnover.</p><p>“Building our relationships within the community itself is the way to deal with that,” Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official from Southern California who is the union’s national director for Amazon, said in a recent interview. “We could have filed for an election in a number of places in the last more than a year, gotten into that process, but we realize that the election process has its shortcomings.”</p><p>The union believes that it can pull a variety of political levers to help put the company on the defensive. Mr. Korgan cited a recent vote by the City Council in Fort Wayne, Ind., denying Amazon a tax abatement after <a href="https://teamster.org/2021/07/after-sustained-push-from-local-414-fort-wayne-city-council-nixes-amazon-tax-abatement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a local Teamsters official</a> spoke out against it, and a vote by the City Council in Arvada, Colo., <a href="https://teamster.org/2021/06/colorado-teamsters-unite-to-say-no-to-amazon-in-their-backyards/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to reject</a> a more than 100,000-square-foot Amazon delivery station. While the Arvada vote centered on traffic concerns, Teamsters played a role in drumming up opposition.</p><p>In California, the Teamsters have joined forces with the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, an advocacy group, to back a bill that would require certain employers to disclose the often opaque productivity quotas applied to workers, which they can be disciplined or fired for failing to meet. The legislative language makes it clear that Amazon is the main target.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The bill, offered by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the author of a 2019 law effectively requiring gig companies to classify workers as employees, would also direct the state’s occupational safety and health agency to develop a regulation ensuring that such quotas don’t put workers at high risk of injury. It passed the State Assembly in May and will be considered by the State Senate later this summer.</p><p>Other labor groups are pressing ahead with less orthodox efforts to increase the power of Amazon workers. Over the first six months of this year, a group called the Solidarity Fund, which raises money from individual tech workers, distributed over $100,000 in grants to workers seeking to organize their colleagues to push for workplace improvements.</p><p>About half the money, in $2,500 increments, went to workers at Amazon. It funded a laptop to assist with organizing, as well as hiring a freelance graphic designer to help make pamphlets, among the varied efforts. Later this month, the fund will begin accepting applications for a second round of grants.</p><p>The group’s sister organization, called Coworker.org, is putting together a detailed report on workplace surveillance measures, including a number of technologies that it says Amazon either developed or pays other companies to use. </p><p>Along with these efforts, the company is likely to face another high-profile election at its warehouse in Bessemer, Ala. Labor law experts said that in such cases a regional director typically accepts the recommendation of the hearing officer, who argued for setting aside the results.</p><p>The officer recommended the dismissal of many of the union’s objections to the election, including the contention that Amazon illegally threatened workers with a loss of pay or benefits if they unionized. But she found that a collection box that Amazon pressured the U.S. Postal Service to install near the warehouse entrance gave workers the impression that the company was monitoring who was voting, thereby tainting the outcome.</p><p>A union brief described how Amazon surrounded the collection box with a tent, on which it printed a company campaign message (“Speak for Yourself”) and the instruction “Mail Your Ballot Here.” The union noted that Amazon’s surveillance cameras could record workers entering and leaving the tent. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If the labor board’s regional office accepts the recommendation to order a new election, Amazon has vowed to appeal to the five-member board in Washington. A recent shift there may affect the outcome: Democrats were assured control of the board in late July, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/senate-approves-union-lawyer-wilcox-nlrb-seat-2021-07-28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when the Senate confirmed</a> two of President Biden’s nominees.</p><p>Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which oversaw the union campaign at the Amazon warehouse, acknowledged in an interview after the first election that high turnover at Amazon and the company’s ability to hold mandatory anti-union meetings made winning a vote difficult. But he said that a long-term campaign could be victorious.</p><p>“I think that we’re going to be able to build on this,” Mr. Appelbaum said. “We pushed the ball downfield. Maybe it’s not the first election. Maybe it’s the second or third election.”</p><p>Workers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/business/economy/amazon-warehouse-labor-robots.html" title="">long complained</a> that one of the most fundamental features of an Amazon warehouse is the amount of control the company exerts — over the pace of work, the way workers perform it, the frequency of their breaks, the time they must spend waiting at metal detectors on their way home.</p><p>In its objection to the election results, the union argued that Amazon had tried to assert a similar level of control over the voting itself, through measures like the collection box. Now the labor board appears on the verge of clawing some of that power back.</p><p>The board’s role in administering union elections was “usurped” by Amazon’s conduct in obtaining the box, the hearing officer said. That conduct, she said, “justifies a second election.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company’s revenue in the second quarter grew 105 percent from the same period last year, to $3.9 billion, slightly higher than analysts expected. Uber also recorded a rare profit of $1.1 billion, thanks to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/didi-wall-street-initial-public-offering.html" title="">initial public offering of the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi</a>, of which Uber owns an 11 percent stake.</p><p>Excluding that one-time gain, Uber said its adjusted losses were $509 million. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/technology/uber-finds-profits-in-leaving-tough-overseas-markets.html" title="">Uber last recorded a profit</a> in the first quarter of 2018, when it sold off parts of its businesses in overseas markets where it faced challenges. The company remains on track to reach its goal of adjusted profitability in the last three months of 2021, Nelson Chai, its chief financial officer, said in a statement.</p><p>Uber and other ride-hailing companies still face uncertainty as the Delta variant causes a surge of Covid-19 cases in the United States and elsewhere. Uber’s food delivery business, Uber Eats, provided a lifeline to the company during earlier lockdowns, when customers stopped taking rides but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/technology/restaurant-delivery-takeout-orders-covid-coronavirus.html" title="">started ordering more food</a>.</p><p>Riders returned to Uber this spring more quickly than drivers, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/uber-lyft-surge.html" title="">long wait times and higher prices</a>. To tempt drivers back to the platform, Uber increased incentives and bonuses. Uber also said it temporarily had lowered the amount it takes from ride hail fares to 18.7 percent, from its usual rate of roughly 20 to 25 percent.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The move worked, according to Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi. “We invested in recovery by investing in drivers, and we made strong progress, with monthly active drivers and couriers in the U.S. increasing by nearly 420,000 from February to July,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement.</p><p>Uber said it attracted 101 million monthly active consumers.</p><p>On Tuesday, Lyft, Uber’s largest competitor in the United States, said it had revenue of $765 million in the second quarter, a 125 percent increase from the previous year. The company narrowed its losses to $251.9 million from $437.1 million and attracted 17 million active riders, a nearly 97 percent increase from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Lyft attributed the growth to its recovery from the peak of the pandemic and said that it had reached its goal of adjusted profitability.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For months, these records — also known as health passes or digital health certificates — have been under discussion around the world as a tool to allow vaccinated people, who are less at risk from the virus, to gather safely. New York will be the first U.S. city to include these passes in a vaccine mandate, potentially setting off similar actions elsewhere.</p><p>But the mainstreaming of these credentials could also usher in an era of increased digital surveillance, privacy researchers said. That’s because vaccine passes may enable location tracking, even as there are few rules about how people’s digital vaccine data should be stored and how it can be shared. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/hipaa-law.html" title="">existing privacy laws</a> limit the sharing of information among medical providers, there is no such rule for when people upload their own data onto an app.</p></div></div><div><p>The moment is reminiscent of the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, privacy advocates said. That was when changes made in the name of national security led to lasting effects including taking off shoes in airports and data collection enabled by the Patriot Act.</p></div><div><div><p>Without safeguards now, presenting a digital vaccination passport every time people enter a public place could lead to a “global map of where people are going,” said Allie Bohm, a policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. The information could be used by third parties for profit or be handed over to law enforcement or immigration authorities, she said.</p><p>“How do we make sure that in 20 years we’re not saying, ‘Well, there was Covid, so now I’ve got this passport on my phone that is also my driver’s license and also has every health record I’ve ever had and every time I go into a store I have to swipe it?’” Ms. Bohm said.</p><p>She added that the passes could particularly disadvantage groups that are more concerned about privacy, including those who are undocumented. The New York Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups have supported legislation to prevent vaccination data from being shared with law enforcement officials and to ensure that the passes do not become permanent health trackers.</p><p>Vaccine passports have largely been rolled out without a national framework in the United States. President Biden has ruled out a national vaccine pass, leaving states, cities and private companies to determine whether and how to have their own electronic systems to keep track of vaccinated people.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Some companies that have developed digital vaccine passes have tried to pre-empt privacy concerns. Over 200 private and public organizations recently joined the Vaccination Credential Initiative, a coalition that aims to standardize how vaccine data is recorded and protected.</p><p>Many developers said they had taken pains to make sure the passports do not cross privacy boundaries. Clear Secure, a security company that has created a health pass used by over 60 organizations, many of them sports venues, said health data about its users was “handled with the utmost care” and protected by a variety of tools. Employers or venues can see only a red or green signal showing whether a user has been inoculated, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The digital health passport CommonPass at Haneda Airport in Tokyo in April. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Yoshikazu Tsuno/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The Commons Project, a nonprofit that has developed a vaccine pass called the CommonPass, stores vaccination and testing data on users’ phones and uploads the information only temporarily to a server to check that a traveler has met requirements, it said. Airlines that have adopted CommonPass, including JetBlue and Lufthansa, can see only whether a passenger has been cleared for travel, it said.</p><p>JP Pollak, a co-founder of the Commons Project, said the group’s vaccine pass was “trustworthy” and kept user data private.</p><p>But while vaccine passports remain nascent, Covid-19 contact-tracing apps that were introduced earlier in the pandemic have already been used by more authoritarian countries in ways that raise privacy questions. That gives researchers little confidence about how these vaccine passes might be used later.</p><p>In China, for example, a program called “reportInfoAndLocationToPolice” within the Alipay Health Code, used by the Chinese government to assess people’s health status, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html" title="">sends a person’s location</a>, city name and an identifying code number to a server as soon as the user grants the software access to personal data.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Singapore, officials said in January that data from the country’s coronavirus contact-tracing system had been used in a criminal investigation, even though leaders had initially said it would be used only for contact tracing. In February, Singapore <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-tech-lawmaking/singapore-to-limit-police-access-to-covid-19-contact-tracing-data-idUSKBN2A20ZI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed</a> a law limiting such use only to “serious” criminal investigations.</p><p>“One of the things that we don’t want is that we normalize surveillance in an emergency and we can’t get rid of it,” said Jon Callas, the director of technology projects at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.</p><p>While such incidents are not occurring in the United States, researchers said, they already see potential for overreach. Several pointed to New York City, where proof of vaccination requirements will start on Aug. 16 and be enforced starting on Sept. 13.</p><p>For proof, people can use their paper vaccination cards, the NYC Covid Safe app or another app, the Excelsior Pass. The <a href="https://www.stopspying.org/excelsior-pass-contract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excelsior Pass</a> was developed by IBM under an estimated $17 million contract with New York State.</p><p>To obtain the pass, people upload their personal information. Under the standard version of the pass, businesses and third parties see only whether the pass is valid, along with the person’s name and date of birth.</p><p>On Wednesday, the state announced the “Excelsior Pass Plus,” which displays not only whether an individual is vaccinated, but includes more information about when and where they got their shot. Businesses scanning the Pass Plus “may be able to save or store the information contained,” according to New York State.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Excelsior Pass app, which people in New York State can download to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>New York Governor&#39;s Press Office, via Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The Excelsior Pass also has a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine-passport.html" title="">Phase 2,</a>” which could involve expanding the app’s use and adding more information like personal details and other health records that could be checked by businesses upon entry.</p><p>IBM has said that it uses <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockchain</a> technology and encryption to protect user data, but did not say how. The company and New York State did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/the-brian-lehrer-show-2021-04-09/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told WNYC in April</a> that he understands the privacy concerns around the Excelsior Pass, but thinks it will still “play an important role.”</p><p>For now, some states and cities are proceeding cautiously. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027768/us-vaccine-passport-guide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More than a dozen states</a>, including Arizona, Florida and Texas, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/us/politics/vaccine-passports-coronavirus.html" title="">in recent months</a> announced some type of ban on vaccine passports. The mayors of San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle have also said they were holding off on passport programs.</p><p>Some business groups and companies that have adopted vaccine passes said the privacy concerns were valid but addressable.</p><p>Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said it supported vaccine passes and was pushing the federal government to establish privacy standards. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, which is helping its members work with Clear, said using the tools to ensure only vaccinated people entered stores was preferable to having businesses shut down again as virus cases climb.</p><p>“People’s privacy is valuable,” said Rodney Fong, the chamber’s president, but “when we’re talking about saving lives, the privacy piece becomes a little less important.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company’s revenue in the second quarter grew 105 percent from the same period last year, to $3.9 billion, slightly higher than analysts expected. Uber also recorded a rare profit of $1.1 billion, thanks to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/didi-wall-street-initial-public-offering.html" title="">initial public offering of the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi</a>, of which Uber owns an 11 percent stake.</p><p>Excluding that one-time gain, Uber said its adjusted losses were $509 million. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/technology/uber-finds-profits-in-leaving-tough-overseas-markets.html" title="">Uber last recorded a profit</a> in the first quarter of 2018, when it sold off parts of its businesses in overseas markets where it faced challenges. The company remains on track to reach its goal of adjusted profitability in the last three months of 2021, Nelson Chai, its chief financial officer, said in a statement.</p><p>Uber’s stock price fell about 8 percent in after hours trading, a result of the declining value of its Didi stake as that company faces regulatory pressure in China.</p><p>Uber and other ride-hailing companies still face uncertainty as the Delta variant causes a surge of Covid-19 cases in the United States and elsewhere. Uber’s food delivery business, Uber Eats, provided a lifeline to the company during earlier lockdowns, when customers stopped taking rides but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/technology/restaurant-delivery-takeout-orders-covid-coronavirus.html" title="">started ordering more food</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Riders returned to Uber this spring more quickly than drivers, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/uber-lyft-surge.html" title="">long wait times and higher prices</a>. To tempt drivers back to the platform, Uber increased incentives and bonuses. Uber also said it temporarily had lowered the amount it takes from ride hail fares to 18.7 percent, from its usual rate of roughly 20 to 25 percent.</p><p>The move worked, according to Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi. “We invested in recovery by investing in drivers, and we made strong progress, with monthly active drivers and couriers in the U.S. increasing by nearly 420,000 from February to July,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement.</p><p>Uber said it attracted 101 million monthly active consumers.</p><p>On Tuesday, Lyft, Uber’s largest competitor in the United States, said it had revenue of $765 million in the second quarter, a 125 percent increase from the previous year. The company narrowed its losses to $251.9 million from $437.1 million and attracted 17 million active riders, a nearly 97 percent increase from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Lyft attributed the growth to its recovery from the peak of the pandemic and said that it had reached its goal of adjusted profitability.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The two men met on numerous occasions starting in 2011 — including at least three times at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse, The Times reported, citing interviews with over a dozen people and related documents.</p><p>“His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, although it would not work for me,” Mr. Gates emailed colleagues in 2011, after their first meeting. A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates told The Times that he “was referring only to the unique décor of the Epstein residence — and Epstein’s habit of spontaneously bringing acquaintances in to meet Mr. Gates.”</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AC360/status/1423076754856587266" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Mr. Cooper’s show</a>, Mr. Gates said: “I had several dinners with him, hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health, through contacts that he had, might emerge. When it looked like that wasn’t a real thing, that relationship ended. But it was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>He added, “You know, there were lots of others in that same situation, but I made a mistake.”</p><p>Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Gates about another article in The Times, which this year reported on his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html" title="">wife’s concerns about his workplace behavior</a>. In 2018, before their divorce, Melinda French Gates had raised issues about her husband’s relationship with Mr. Epstein and a harassment claim against his money manager. On at least a few occasions, Mr. Gates pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the reporting.</p><p>Asked on Wednesday if he had regrets, Mr. Gates replied: “Certainly, everyone does.” He added later, “Within the family, we’ll heal as best we can, and learn from what’s happened.”</p><p>Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, has a net worth estimated at $130 billion, and the Gates Foundation now has an endowment of $65 billion, by most measures making it the largest private charitable foundation in the world. Both Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates have pledged to keep working at the foundation on issues including global health, poverty reduction and gender equality.</p><p>“We are communicating and working at the foundation, so that partnership, we’re going to try and continue,” Mr. Gates said on CNN. “Melinda has incredible strengths that she brings that help the foundation be better. We’ve always enjoyed our work together. The two of us can go out and work with leaders and help build the organization. That would definitely be the best thing for the foundation.”</p><p>For much of the interview, Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Gates about his views of the state of the pandemic. Mr. Gates praised the efficacy and mass production of the Covid-19 vaccines, but expressed worry about how easily the Delta variant of the coronavirus can be spread.</p></div></div><div><p>“We wanted to be nearer the end than we are,” he said, “but Delta’s very bad news.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For months, these records — also known as health passes or digital health certificates — have been under discussion around the world as a tool to allow vaccinated people, who are less at risk from the virus, to gather safely. New York will be the first U.S. city to include these passes in a vaccine mandate, potentially setting off similar actions elsewhere.</p><p>But the mainstreaming of these credentials could also usher in an era of increased digital surveillance, privacy researchers said. That’s because vaccine passes may enable location tracking, even as there are few rules about how people’s digital vaccine data should be stored and how it can be shared. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/hipaa-law.html" title="">existing privacy laws</a> limit the sharing of information among medical providers, there is no such rule for when people upload their own data onto an app.</p></div></div><div><p>The moment is reminiscent of the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, privacy advocates said. That was when changes made in the name of national security led to lasting effects including taking off shoes in airports and data collection enabled by the Patriot Act.</p></div><div><div><p>Without safeguards now, presenting a digital vaccination passport every time people enter a public place could lead to a “global map of where people are going,” said Allie Bohm, a policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. The information could be used by third parties for profit or be handed over to law enforcement or immigration authorities, she said.</p><p>“How do we make sure that in 20 years we’re not saying, ‘Well, there was Covid, so now I’ve got this passport on my phone that is also my driver’s license and also has every health record I’ve ever had and every time I go into a store I have to swipe it?’” Ms. Bohm said.</p><p>She added that the passes could particularly disadvantage groups that are more concerned about privacy, including those who are undocumented. The New York Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups have supported legislation to prevent vaccination data from being shared with law enforcement officials and to ensure that the passes do not become permanent health trackers.</p><p>Vaccine passports have largely been rolled out without a national framework in the United States. President Biden has ruled out a national vaccine pass, leaving states, cities and private companies to determine whether and how to have their own electronic systems to keep track of vaccinated people.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Some companies that have developed digital vaccine passes have tried to pre-empt privacy concerns. Over 200 private and public organizations recently joined the Vaccination Credential Initiative, a coalition that aims to standardize how vaccine data is recorded and protected.</p><p>Many developers said they had taken pains to make sure the passports do not cross privacy boundaries. Clear Secure, a security company that has created a health pass used by over 60 organizations, many of them sports venues, said health data about its users was “handled with the utmost care” and protected by a variety of tools. Employers or venues can see only a red or green signal showing whether a user has been inoculated, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The digital health passport CommonPass at Haneda Airport in Tokyo in April. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Yoshikazu Tsuno/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The Commons Project, a nonprofit that has developed a vaccine pass called the CommonPass, stores vaccination and testing data on users’ phones and uploads the information only temporarily to a server to check that a traveler has met requirements, it said. Airlines that have adopted CommonPass, including JetBlue and Lufthansa, can see only whether a passenger has been cleared for travel, it said.</p><p>JP Pollak, a co-founder of the Commons Project, said the group’s vaccine pass was “trustworthy” because users’ data was not stored on the cloud and because the pass limits the information businesses can see.</p><p>But while vaccine passports remain nascent, Covid-19 contact-tracing apps that were introduced earlier in the pandemic have already been used by more authoritarian countries in ways that raise privacy questions. That gives researchers little confidence about how these vaccine passes might be used later.</p><p>In China, for example, a program called “reportInfoAndLocationToPolice” within the Alipay Health Code, used by the Chinese government to assess people’s health status, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html" title="">sends a person’s location</a>, city name and an identifying code number to a server as soon as the user grants the software access to personal data.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Singapore, officials said in January that data from the country’s coronavirus contact-tracing system had been used in a criminal investigation, even though leaders had initially said it would be used only for contact tracing. In February, Singapore <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-tech-lawmaking/singapore-to-limit-police-access-to-covid-19-contact-tracing-data-idUSKBN2A20ZI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed</a> a law limiting such use only to “serious” criminal investigations.</p><p>“One of the things that we don’t want is that we normalize surveillance in an emergency and we can’t get rid of it,” said Jon Callas, the director of technology projects at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.</p><p>While such incidents are not occurring in the United States, researchers said, they already see potential for overreach. Several pointed to New York City, where proof of vaccination requirements will start on Aug. 16 and be enforced starting on Sept. 13.</p><p>For proof, people can use their paper vaccination cards, the NYC Covid Safe app or another app, the Excelsior Pass. The <a href="https://www.stopspying.org/excelsior-pass-contract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excelsior Pass</a> was developed by IBM under an estimated $17 million contract with New York State.</p><p>To obtain the pass, people upload their personal information. Under the standard version of the pass, businesses and third parties see only whether the pass is valid, along with the person’s name and date of birth.</p><p>On Wednesday, the state announced the “Excelsior Pass Plus,” which displays not only whether an individual is vaccinated, but includes more information about when and where they got their shot. Businesses scanning the Pass Plus “may be able to save or store the information contained,” according to New York State.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The Excelsior Pass app, which people in New York State can download to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>New York Governor&#39;s Press Office, via Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The Excelsior Pass also has a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine-passport.html" title="">Phase 2,</a>” which could involve expanding the app’s use and adding more information like personal details and other health records that could be checked by businesses upon entry.</p><p>IBM has said that it uses <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockchain</a> technology and encryption to protect user data, but did not say how. The company and New York State did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/the-brian-lehrer-show-2021-04-09/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told WNYC in April</a> that he understands the privacy concerns around the Excelsior Pass, but thinks it will still “play an important role.”</p><p>For now, some states and cities are proceeding cautiously. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027768/us-vaccine-passport-guide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More than a dozen states</a>, including Arizona, Florida and Texas, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/us/politics/vaccine-passports-coronavirus.html" title="">in recent months</a> announced some type of ban on vaccine passports. The mayors of San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle have also said they were holding off on passport programs.</p><p>Some business groups and companies that have adopted vaccine passes said the privacy concerns were valid but addressable.</p><p>Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said it supported vaccine passes and was pushing the federal government to establish privacy standards. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, which is helping its members work with Clear, said using the tools to ensure only vaccinated people entered stores was preferable to having businesses shut down again as virus cases climb.</p><p>“People’s privacy is valuable,” said Rodney Fong, the chamber’s president, but “when we’re talking about saving lives, the privacy piece becomes a little less important.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

Biden Jr., then a presidential candidate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html" title="">released his $2 trillion climate plan</a> last year that promised to escalate the use of clean energy in the United States, the world’s major oil and gas dialed up their presence on Facebook.</p><p>Overnight on Facebook’s U.S. platforms, 25 of the biggest oil and gas producers, industry lobby groups and advocacy organizations unleashed a surge in ads promoting fossil fuels, according to ad spending data <a href="https://influencemap.org/EN/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-a40c8116160668aa2d865da2f5abe91b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analyzed by InfluenceMap</a>, a London-based watchdog that tracks corporate influence on climate policy.</p><p>By the following week, collective ad spend by the companies like Exxon Mobil — as well as powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute — had risen more than 1,000 percent, from a seven-day rolling average of about $6,700 a day to more than $86,000 a day, according to the data, based on disclosures by Facebook and tallied by InfluenceMap. For the whole of 2020, some<strong> </strong>25,147 ads logged more than 431 million views, bringing Facebook almost $10 million in advertising revenue on those ads.</p></div></div><div><p>“Do you support America’s pipelines? We all depend on this critical infrastructure for affordable energy supplies!” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;id=646491162630349&amp;view_all_page_id=925007000949719&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said an ad</a> run by Exxon starting on July 15, 2020, the day after Mr. Biden’s climate announcement. “Natural gas is already clean, affordable and efficient — and it’s getting better every day,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;id=225862101836416&amp;view_all_page_id=67945990059&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said an ad</a> by the American Petroleum Institute starting on July 20.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">An Exxon Mobil ad that appeared on Facebook. Ad spending by oil groups surged on the platform last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>via Facebook</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Of the 25 companies and groups, Exxon and API were the largest users of paid ads on Facebook’s U.S. platforms in 2020, accounting for 62 percent of the total ads analyzed by InfluenceMap. The analysis found that ads were shown to more men than women overall, though there were some variations: posts that focused on fossil fuels as part of the climate solution were shown to more women, while those that argued oil and gas were a pragmatic choice economically were shown to more men.</p><p>Recent research has highlighted that though natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel than coal or oil, releasing less greenhouse gases that are the driver of global warming, there are heavy emissions associated with producing the gas. Scientists, environmentalists and, increasingly, regulators have called out the portrayal of gas as a low-carbon fuel as misleading.</p><p>In a statement, Facebook pointed out that similar ads run on many platforms, including television, and that the social networking platform offered transparency by making its ad data available. (Many large traditional news organizations, including The New York Times, also accept oil-company advertising.) Facebook’s advertising policies also ban ads containing misleading information, and require those on social or political issues to be clearly labeled.</p><p>“We reject ads when one of our independent fact-checking partners rates them as false or misleading and take action against pages, groups, accounts, and websites that repeatedly share content rated as false,” Facebook said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>An Exxon spokesman, Todd M, Spitler, said the oil producer believed “that sound public policy is achieved when a variety of informed voices participate in the political process. For these reasons, Exxon Mobil exercises its right to support and participate in policy discussions.” An API spokeswoman, Megan Bloomgren, said that the lobby group’s social media spending was “a fraction of the robust investments our companies are making every day into breakthrough technological research to shape a lower carbon future.”</p><p>Geoffrey Supran, a Harvard University researcher who has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332221002335" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">examined the fossil fuel industry’s climate messaging</a>, said aspects of InfluenceMap’s findings were consistent with his research. InfluenceMap identified several different types of messaging in the Facebook ads — including presenting oil and gas as part of the solution on climate change — that had become part of the industry’s playbook, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">An Exxon Mobil ad that appeared on Facebook. “Exxon Mobil exercises its right to support and participate in policy discussions,” a spokesman said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>via Facebook</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“What our research has shown is that over the past decade or so, the industry has gradually shifted from outright disinformation about climate science to more subtle and insidious messaging,” he said. But those messages “work to muddy the waters to the same end — which is to stop action on climate change,” he said. “Media and communication platforms need to stop being used — they need to stop being pawns of fossil fuel propaganda and to protect the public.”</p><p>The analysis comes as a big part of Mr. Biden’s climate vision, his $1 trillion infrastructure package, moves forward in Congress, with substantial investments aimed at addressing climate change. But it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/climate-electricity-infrastructure.html" title="">far from the broader package</a> that Mr. Biden had sought, and has also angered climate advocates for extending a lifeline to fossil fuels by allocating some funds to natural gas infrastructure.</p><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/technology/facebook-election-chaos-november.html" title="">temporarily suspended new political ads</a> ahead of the U.S. presidential elections in November to reduce misinformation and interference. The social networking site has since lifted that ban, and most of the groups tracked by InfluenceMap continue to run ads.</p><p>“While this research focused on 2020,” said Faye Holder, who authored the InfluenceMap report, “the reality is the oil and gas sector is continuing to use Facebook as a key tool.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT" title=""><em>sign up here</em></a><em> to receive it weekdays.</em></p><p>This question will sound ridiculous, but it isn’t: Is YouTube a success?</p><p>Please hold your boos. It’s hard to imagine the internet without YouTube. Buying the video site in its relative infancy was one of the smartest things Google ever did. But after nearly 15 years of being part of Google, the most successful money machine in internet history, it’s still not clear that YouTube has fulfilled its financial potential both for itself and everyone involved in its vast digital economy.</p><p>Two data points: The money that YouTube keeps from selling advertisements — its main source of income — was about $11.2 billion in the past year, not much more than the ad revenue of ViacomCBS, a mid-tier American TV company that owns the CBS television network. Twitter, which is not so hot at money, pulls in roughly double the ad sales on average from each of its users compared with YouTube.</p><p>No one should feel bad about YouTube. Yeah, it’s fine. But it says something about the vitality of the internet that YouTube is probably the most vibrant economy online and it’s still hard to call it an unqualified financial winner. And if YouTube isn’t winning, its masses of video creators also won’t be.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The internet’s big promise was to give anyone a shot at making a living from doing what they love, but YouTube shows just how elusive that dream turned out to be. If YouTube isn’t quite living up to high hopes, that means the internet isn’t, either.</p><p>Let me dig a little deeper into how odd YouTube is in one important respect: It pays some of the people and companies that stock its virtual shelves with products.</p><p>At Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter, we make their products for free — with some exceptions — in the form of our silly memes, photos from engagement parties and beauty tutorials that we post. For video makers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/technology/youtube-online-harassment.html" title="">that meet YouTube’s standards</a>, the site typically hands over to those people and organizations about 55 percent of the money from ads that appear in or around their videos.</p><p>Because of YouTube’s revenue sharing and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/10-ways-monetize-youtube/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other ways</a> for content creators to make money from videos, it most likely has delivered more income to people online than any internet site ever. (This is impossible to prove. People do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/technology/fypm-creators-app-pay.html" title="">make money</a> in less direct ways from building an audience on places like Instagram and TikTok, but YouTube remains a go-to spot for people to earn an income online.)</p><p>Maybe YouTube, particularly after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/business/media/youtube-advertisers-offensive-content.html" title="">revelations</a> several years ago that companies’ advertisements were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/25/google-youtube-advertising-extremist-content-att-verizon" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appearing in</a> videos that promoted anti-Semitism and other horrific views, has been less aggressive than companies like Facebook and Twitter about shoving commercial messages everywhere. This is a good thing, even if those are missed opportunities for YouTube and video makers to earn more money.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The end result is that YouTube makes a lot of money for itself and video makers, and its revenue is growing very quickly, but the numbers remain kind of meh relative to its size and influence.</p><p>The fact that I even mentioned YouTube in the same paragraph as the middling TV company ViacomCBS and Twitter … well, that says something about how YouTube <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-12-29/youtube-s-wojcicki-needs-to-make-her-business-a-tv-star?sref=Qk91czAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has underwhelmed</a> for some time. YouTube’s cut of ad revenue is also less than half the size of Netflix’s yearly revenue. (Those figures don’t count YouTube’s income from other sources including subscriptions, which the company does not regularly disclose.)</p><p>If YouTube has so far fallen short of its financial potential, what does that say about the rest of the digital world? If you read the work of people like my colleague <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/taylor-lorenz" title="">Taylor Lorenz</a>, who chronicles the internet’s labor force, it’s easy to see that there may be a mismatch between the promise of the internet economy and the reality.</p><p>Some people do earn a good living from their creations on YouTube or other apps, but many others are constantly hustling for peanuts and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/style/creator-burnout-social-media.html" title="">burning out</a>.</p><p>It’s hard to stand out in the sea of people making dance videos on TikTok, livestreaming video games on Twitch or hosting YouTube talk shows, and it has always been that way for creative professions. Except digital optimists wanted to believe that the internet would make it easier and more democratic for anyone to find their fans and their calling.</p><p>That’s why YouTube’s finances matter to the rest of us. If YouTube isn’t quite working out, then the promise of the internet isn’t, either.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div><p>Tip of the Week</p><h2 id="link-58538888">Watching the Olympics is still hard</h2><p><em>Watching TV should be easy, but GOOD GRACIOUS it’s not simple in the United States to watch the Olympics events we want to see. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brian-x-chen" title=""><em>Brian X. Chen</em></a><em>, the consumer technology columnist for The New York Times, walks us through his efforts.</em></p><p>I learned the hard way that people who ditch cable TV still get the short end of the stick.</p><p>This week, I was trying to watch a replay of the rock climbing events at the Olympics. I was particularly interested in seeing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/sports/olympics/adam-ondra-climbing.html" title="">Adam Ondra, the world’s best climber</a>.</p><p>But the recording of the semifinals that NBC made available on YouTube TV, the online bundle of TV channels that I pay for, trimmed the climbing coverage to just one hour. To my frustration, the segment omitted most of Ondra’s airtime. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/sports/olympics/mens-climbing-final-olympics.html" title="">Read this</a> if you want to know how Ondra did in Thursday’s competition.)</p><p>I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/bxchen/status/1422732712394190849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snarky complaint</a> on Twitter. I soon learned from my followers that the Olympics coverage that Americans see on prime-time television or stream on services like YouTube TV is vastly inferior to the more complete Olympics event coverage in the <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/sports-mobile" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC Sports app</a>.</p><p>I downloaded the NBC Sports app and there it was: full footage of each event! But I ran into another problem. To use the service, I needed to log into the app with account information for a cable TV subscription, which I don’t have.</p><p>(There is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/22/how-to-watch-tokyo-olympics-free/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olympics coverage</a> on Peacock, the video streaming service that’s part of the same company as NBC. It’s confusing.)</p><p>Long story short, cord cutting is great. It’s far easier than it used to be for sports junkies to watch live games and events online. But it’s still optimal to have cable TV, too. Who can afford <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/technology/personaltech/streaming-media-home-server.html" title="">all these subscriptions</a>?</p></div></div><div><div><hr/><h2 id="link-652545a9">Before we go …</h2><ul><li><p><strong>We still haven’t figured out health apps: </strong>New York is the first large jurisdiction in the United States where restaurants, gyms and other public places will require that customers provide proof of vaccination against the coronavirus. My colleagues Erin Woo and Kellen Browning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/technology/vaccine-passport-ny-privacy.html" title="">look at the privacy implications</a> of electronic systems to keep track of vaccinated people. (Other countries have also rolled out digital vaccine verification systems.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Facebook vs. academics: </strong>The company said that researchers who solicited volunteers to help study the opaque system of ad targeting on Facebook are threatening people’s privacy. Facebook has a valid argument, Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-05/what-s-driving-facebook-s-spat-with-nyu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a>, and so do the academics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remember the Segway? No? Exactly.</strong> A former book agent writes in Slate about his role in <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/08/dean-kamen-viral-mystery-invention-2001.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overhyping the Segway</a>, a novel but ultimately unpopular scooter introduced in 2001 that promised to change the world and did not. It’s a useful lesson in how the pressure of impossible dreams can ruin the chances of a new product.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1e910efa"><span>Hugs to this</span></h3><p>The crowd at the 1996 Democratic National Convention <a href="https://twitter.com/HowardMortman/status/1422627032127754243" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">danced to “Macarena.”</a> It is painfully corny and wonderful.</p><hr/><p><em>We want to hear from you.

Yet, electric utilities and companies that install rooftop solar panels have long been at loggerheads about how that power is produced and who should make money from it.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/lynn-jurich-sunrun.html" title="">the country’s largest rooftop solar installer</a> has decided to hire its chief executive from the utility industry. The company, Sunrun, said on Thursday that it had hired Mary Powell, who formerly ran Green Mountain Power, which is based in Vermont.</p><p>Sunrun said it had picked Ms. Powell to help the company extend even further into the kinds of businesses that until recently were the domain of regulated electric utilities like Consolidated Edison in New York and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in California. Instead of just installing panels on homes, Sunrun has been trying to become a new kind of energy company that supplies solar and storage products to customers while allowing them to sell power to the electric grid.</p><p>The appointment signals that Sunrun and other rooftop solar companies intend to play a bigger role in the transition to renewable energy that President Biden hopes to accelerate with tens of billions of dollars in new federal spending, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/28/upshot/infrastructure-breakdown.html" title="">the bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> that the Senate is considering now. Sunrun and Ms. Powell have pushed for greater investment in rooftop solar, batteries and other local sources of power, rather than the approach favored by large utilities, which want to build <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/business/energy-environment/biden-climate-transmission-lines.html" title="">thousands of miles of new power lines</a> and large wind and solar farms in remote locations.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In an interview, Ms. Powell, who led Green Mountain when it built Vermont’s largest wind farm and began installing batteries in homes, said she was joining Sunrun because rooftop solar and other small energy devices could be installed more quickly than large utility projects that can take a decade or more to build. She also said too many people in the energy business were too wedded to a system that never contemplated a two-way relationship between utilities and consumers.</p><p>“My passion around climate change is the reason I am passionate about this company,” said Ms. Powell, who ran Green Mountain for more than a decade before leaving at the end of 2019. “I’ve been working on this issue for 20 years. It’s so shocking to me that people are holding on so tightly to a system that is 100 years old.”</p><p>Ms. Powell, who has been on Sunrun’s board since 2018, will replace Sunrun’s founder, Lynn Jurich, who will become co-executive chairwoman.</p><p>“This is very much motivated by both of our intense feelings that we need to go faster on climate,” Ms. Jurich said. “Climate change is not waiting around for us to build large-scale transmission lines.”</p><p>Some energy executives and climate activists have argued that the country needs an “all of the above” approach to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for climate change. The country needs large and small energy projects, transmission lines, and home and business batteries, which can be as small as large televisions and as big as shipping containers. These investments, activists say, need to happen quickly because wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, winter storms and other extreme weather linked to climate change have crippled electricity grids.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“This is bigger than utilities,” Pedro J. Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, said during a recent interview. “This is bigger than one industry.”</p><p>Yet, utilities and rooftop solar companies are engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/climate/rooftop-solar-panels-tax-credits-utility-companies-lobbying.html" title="">fierce political battles in state capitals</a>. Many utilities and their allies are asking regulators and lawmakers in places like California and Florida to reduce the rates they pay for the electricity produced by rooftop solar panels. Or they are seeking to impose new fees on rooftop panels.</p><p>Utilities argue that these changes are needed because as more homeowners buy solar panels, fewer people are left to share the cost of maintaining the grid. But homeowner groups and solar installers like Sunrun counter that the utility-led efforts will reduce the number of people who can afford rooftop panels, which they argue lower emissions and help bring down the cost of electricity for everybody by reducing the need for new transmission lines and power plants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Sunrun is the country’s largest rooftop solar installer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Collin Chappelle for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“To achieve the necessary emissions reductions, solar will have to grow four times faster than we are growing today,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement last week.</p><p>In addition to utility opposition, the rooftop solar business faces other obstacles. The cost of installing solar panels is much higher in the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/energy-environment/australia-rooftop-solar-coal.html" title="">than in countries like Australia</a>, in part because obtaining permits from local governments is more onerous here. Many rooftop solar companies, which spend substantially on sales and marketing, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/business/energy-environment/rooftop-solar-installers.html" title="">not consistently profitable</a>.</p><p>Sunrun said on Thursday that it had lost $41 million in the second quarter, up from $14 million a year earlier. The company last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/business/energy-environment/sunrun-vivint-solar.html" title="">acquired Vivint</a>, one of its biggest competitors, extending its lead as the largest rooftop solar installer in the country. But its stock price has tumbled in recent months, falling from about $80 in February to about $50 now.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Powell will have to convince investors that Sunrun’s plans to expand beyond installing panels will be profitable. (Her brother Michael Powell is a reporter at The New York Times.)</p><p>Vikram Aggarwal, the founder and chief executive of EnergySage, a rooftop solar comparison shopping service, said Ms. Powell’s experience at Green Mountain could be useful to Sunrun.</p><p>“I think Mary Powell is a very highly regarded utility executive,” he said. “She’s very consumer focused. She knows the climate crisis and all.”</p><p>Sunrun recently announced an agreement with Ford Motor to make it easy for people to use the electric version of the company’s F-150 pickup truck coming out next year to power homes during blackouts for as long as 10 days. Such approaches are growing more popular as blackouts and power shut-offs become more common because of extreme weather and wildfires caused by utility equipment.</p><p>Sunrun also wants to expand the use of so-called virtual power plants, which harness the power produced by rooftop solar panels that is stored in home batteries to support the electric grid during times of high demand. Such systems played an important role during blackouts in California last summer.</p><p>“This is the way customers and businesses are moving all over the world,” Ms. Powell said. “From my perspective there’s no stopping that momentum.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

President Biden’s commitment to follow a similar strategy means that the world’s three largest car markets are moving away from internal combustion at a faster pace than anyone predicted a few years ago.</p><p>“This is the last major piece in the jigsaw,” said Peter Wells, director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales. “This does put pressure on some of the more laggardly companies.”</p><p>Mr. Biden’s announcement is good news for Tesla, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the battery-powered cars sold in the United States, and potentially bad news for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html" title="">Toyota Motor</a>, the world’s largest automaker, which will not begin selling a car powered solely by batteries in the United States until next year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In between are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/general-motors-electric-cars.html" title="">General Motors</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/business/ford-mustang-ev-tesla.html" title="">Ford Motor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/business/volkswagen-electric-cars-share-price.html" title="">Volkswagen</a>, which have begun selling tens of thousands of electric cars but depend on vehicles with internal combustion engines for most of their revenue and profit.</p><p>It is by no means certain that the familiar car brands will be dividing the expanding market for electric vehicles among themselves. The shift to battery power is an opportunity for Chinese carmakers to expand into new markets, which they are doing with strong support from their government. <a href="https://www.nio.com/news/nio-announces-norway-strategy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIO</a>, for example, has announced plans to open a dealership in Oslo in September as a first step into the European market.</p><p>The president’s declaration could also help start-ups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, both based in the United States, that are expected to deliver their first vehicles this year.</p><p>Mr. Biden framed his push in part as a geopolitical competition in an emerging technology. The initiative is part of an effort “to drive the electric vehicle future forward, outcompete China and tackle the climate crisis,” according to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a White House fact sheet.</a></p><p>Europe is also far ahead of the United States in E.V. sales. The European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, has effectively compelled the auto industry to sell electric cars by imposing stiff fines on companies that exceed limits on carbon dioxide emissions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Governments in Germany and other European countries are also offering generous cash incentives for electric car purchases. And an increasing number of consumers like the smooth, quick acceleration of electric vehicles, the savings on fuel and maintenance, and the satisfaction of not producing any tailpipe emissions.</p><p>In the first six months of the year, 17 percent of the new cars sold in Europe were battery-powered vehicles or plug-in hybrids, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, which tracks E.V. sales in Europe. In the United States, fewer than 4 percent of new cars were pure-electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, according to June sales figures compiled by Argonne National Laboratory.</p><p>The European Commission continues to turn up the pressure, announcing plans to effectively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/business/european-union-climate-change.html" title="">ban sales of cars with internal combustion engines</a> in 2035.</p><p>By comparison, the Biden administration’s goals are modest, which has earned it criticism from some environmentalists. Plug-in hybrids, which have internal combustion engines in addition to batteries, would count as electric vehicles, giving Toyota some breathing room because of its leadership in that technology. And in 2030 half of the vehicles sold in the United States would still be powered by gasoline or diesel. Because cars typically stay on the road for more than a decade, that means the country will probably not be rid of internal combustion vehicles or gas stations for many years.</p><p>The White House’s caution may reflect recognition of the scale of the industrial transformation that lies ahead. The president’s plan also calls for construction of a nationwide network of charging stations and money to help companies retool factories to produce electric cars and components. One major risk is economic dislocation and job losses if the businesses that make parts for gasoline vehicles can’t adapt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The opening ceremony for Zeekr, an electric vehicle brand, in Hangzhou Bay, China. The shift to battery power is an opportunity for Chinese carmakers to move outside their domestic market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lorenz Huber for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>America also lacks enough battery factories. The European Commission is providing financial support to build battery factories in the European Union to reduce its reliance on Asia, where most batteries are currently produced.</p></div><div><div><p>Automakers expect the government to provide substantial help.</p><p>“Federal and state governments — and all stakeholders — will need to provide significant support for consumers, infrastructure and innovation,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group, said in a statement.</p><p>The U.S. government has previously played a critical role in kicking off the transition to electric vehicles. In January 2010, the Obama administration <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">granted Tesla a $465 million loan</a> to help the company develop and manufacture its Model S sedan.</p><p>“Without that $465 million, the Model S would have never happened,” Peter Rawlinson, who was chief engineer for that car and is now the chief executive of Lucid, said in an interview in June. “Tesla probably wouldn’t exist today. Really, the U.S. government made Tesla the success that it is today. That is a hell of an achievement.”</p><p>Companies that are already building electric cars in significant numbers have an advantage, Mr. Wells of Cardiff Business School said, because they have collected years of data on how owners use those vehicles. That includes not only Tesla but Nissan, whose battery-powered Leaf has been on the market for more than a decade, and G.M., which introduced the Bolt in 2016 and made the EV1 back in 1996.</p><p>G.M. is building two battery plants in the United States and has said it aims to phase out production of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. The company says it will spend $35 billion in the five years ending in 2025 to develop electric models.</p><p>“We are very committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and moving to an all-electric future as soon as possible,” the company’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said on Wednesday.</p><p>Ford this year started selling an electric sport utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, which has done well and been praised by critics. It plans to add an electric Transit van this year and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/business/ford-electric-vehicle-f-150.html" title="">electric F-150 pickup truck</a> next year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Companies that have been slower, like Stellantis, which owns Ram, Jeep and Chrysler, brands that do not yet have vehicles solely powered by batteries, face additional pressure to catch up. Jeep started selling a plug-in hybrid version of its popular Wrangler this year and plans to start selling fully electric vehicles by 2023.</p><p>“Automotive industry leaders have seen the writing on the wall for some time now when it comes to electrification and autonomous technologies,” said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds, a market researcher.</p><p>Ms. Caldwell added that the sales targets set by the Biden administration and the automakers “are certainly not unreasonable, and most likely achievable by 2030 given that automakers have already baked in large numbers of electric vehicles into their future product cycles.”</p><p>But many automakers are just beginning to bring electric vehicles to market that have been designed from the ground up to run on batteries. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/02/business/mercedes-eqs-electric-vehicles.html" title="">Mercedes-Benz EQS</a>, a luxury electric sedan, will go on sale in the United States this month. BMW began selling a battery-powered vehicle, the i3, eight years ago but was slow to follow up. The iX, an electric S.U.V., will arrive at American dealers early next year.</p><p>And just because companies make electric vehicles does not mean that people will buy them. Volkswagen began selling an electric S.U.V., the ID.4, this year, but sales in the United States so far have been only a fraction of the company’s established models like the Jetta or Tiguan.</p><p>By setting a clear target for electric vehicle sales, Mr. Biden is adding momentum to the shift to clean transportation, but he is also unleashing forces that automakers may not be able to control.</p><p>Consumers could stampede to electric vehicles as they become less expensive and people realize that gasoline vehicles are in danger of becoming white elephants with plunging resale value. That would strain companies that, with the exception of Tesla and some start-ups, are still mainly in the business of producing cars with internal combustion engines.</p></div></div><div><p>“The industry may lose control of this transition,” Mr. Wells said, “and it could be a volatile period.”</p></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its net profit margin, however, was 9.8 percent, up from 9.2 percent last year.</p><p>As a closely held company, Huawei is not legally obligated to report its earnings. It publishes only a small selection of financial results, and not on a quarterly basis.</p><p>“Our aim is to survive, and to do so sustainably,” Eric Xu, one of Huawei’s deputy chairmen, said in a statement on Friday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Over the past few years, Huawei’s ability to work with the international computer chip industry has narrowed because of a series of rules that were imposed by the Trump administration. It has become extremely hard for the company to produce the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/china-smartphones-iphone.html" title="">cutting-edge phones</a> that had made it a global Goliath not long ago. Huawei denies that its products threaten any nation’s security.</p><p>The U.S. sanctions also prevent Huawei devices from running Google’s most popular apps. That has been driving away customers outside of China for awhile.</p><p>But even within China, where many Google apps have long been blocked, Huawei’s handset business is sinking quickly. In the latest quarter, for the first time in over seven years, Huawei was not one of China’s five best-selling phone brands, according to the market research firm Canalys.

Posts from the last two weeks, many of them on TikTok, show this year’s Olympians flirting, knitting, dancing, answering personal questions — and, of course, making sex jokes.</p><p>Here’s just a sampling of what’s been happening in their downtime, as seen on the smallest of screens.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-9166e3b">‘Anti-Sex’ Beds and Free Condoms</h2><p>Athletes across the board — the Israeli baseball team, an Irish gymnast, American rugby players — have posted videos of themselves and teammates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/world/asia/tokyo-olympics-anti-sex-beds-cardboard.html" title="">attempting to corrupt the cardboard beds</a> in the Olympic Village. Many of these “test the bed” videos were a humorous response to the rumor that the recycled beds were provided as a way to dissuade athletes from having sex. (That is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/world/asia/tokyo-olympics-anti-sex-beds-cardboard.html" title="">not the case</a>, according to the company that made them.)</p></div></div><div><p>In another jokey take on the Olympic Village’s reputation as a hookup zone, Noah Williams, a British diver, posted a TikTok video of himself and his teammate Tom Daley unboxing hundreds of free condoms. (The contraceptives have been provided by the organizers of the Olympics for more than 30 years to encourage sexual health.)</p></div><section id="06OLYMPICS-TIKTOK-CONDOMS" data-id="100000007904835" data-source-id="100000007904835"></section><div><div><h2 id="link-734ebe4b">Meet Me After Your Round?</h2><p>Other Olympians have been using social media to flirt with — or at least openly admire — their fellow competitors from afar.</p><p>Tyler Downs, an Olympic diver, posted a video on TikTok directed at Simone Biles, asking the decorated gymnast to “talk 2 me.” A Japanese fencer named Kaito Streets took the same approach with Naomi Osaka, the tennis player.

In one video, she pans over a spread of salmon, steak, peaches, melons, fried calamari, seaweed rice balls, vegetable tempura and a chocolate mousse. The mousse really got her attention (“10/10,” Ms. Robinson wrote.)</p></div></div><section id="06OLYMPICS-TIKTOK-FOOD" data-id="100000007905046" data-source-id="100000007905046"></section><div><div><p>Erica Ogwumike, a basketball player for the Nigerian team and a student in medical school, gave a short overview of the “polyclinic,” where athletes can receive acupuncture, dermatology treatments, physiotherapy and more.</p><p>Various athletes have answered frequently asked questions about their sport, themselves and being in the Olympics. (For volleyball players, “how tall are you?” is a common one.)</p><p>Cody Melphy, an American rugby player, has used his TikTok page to answer more niche questions, like whether athletes are allowed to keep the comforters that come with their cardboard beds (they are) and what happens if an athlete’s laundry is lost (Mr. Melphy washed his used clothes in a bathtub).</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Daley, a swimmer and gold medalist who appeared in the condom unboxing video, has also been sharing his progress on knitting projects. On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madewithlovebytomdaley/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an Instagram page devoted to his knitted and crocheted creations</a>, he said that the hobby has kept him “sane.”</p><p>Some competitors brought their fans into the experience even before reaching Tokyo. Liza Pletneva, a rhythmic gymnast from the United States, documented her team’s journey from home, which included a six-hour layover in Amsterdam, an 11-hour flight to Tokyo and five hours of processing upon arrival.</p><p>In comments on these videos, TikTok users are expressing their appreciation for how much inside scoop the Olympians have been posting. Noah Schnapp, an actor best known for his role on “Stranger Things,” published a video on TikTok saying he didn’t know Olympic athletes were so “funny and normal” and that seeing their routines on TikTok has changed the entire experience of spectating.</p><p>So the ratings are in. Season 1 of Olympics TikTok is a success.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

People have spent millions of dollars for pieces of digital artwork — known as nonfungible tokens — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html" title="">internet memes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/business/nba-top-shot-moments.html" title="">video highlights</a> of National Basketball Association players. Physical goods, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/automobiles/collectibles/honda-toyota-cars.html" title="">old cars</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/sports/sports-trading-cards-millions.html" title="">sports cards</a>, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/style/spending-rich-people.html" title="">soared in value</a> over the last year, too.</p><p>But video games are still a nascent market, Mr. Petrozzo said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/video-games-wata-heritage.html" title="">Interest in buying old games</a> has picked up some in recent years, but many vintage games have been opened and played, causing them to lose value, he said, and investors are often intimidated from entering an industry they’re unfamiliar with.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Recently, though, a pair of head-turning sales have jolted interest in the gaming space. A 1987 Legend of Zelda game cartridge that <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/07/10/business/zelda-auction-nes-record/#:~:text=New%20York%20%E2%80%93%20A%20sealed%20cartridge,said%20in%20a%20statement%20Friday." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold for $870,000</a> in early July was considered a record, until a 1996 Super Mario 64 game went for $1.56 million just days later.</p><p>“I think that we’re starting to see the natural progression of ‘What else? What are the things that have appreciated in value from my childhood that have that nostalgia?’” Mr. Petrozzo said.</p><p>The past two record sales were made via an auction. Rally uses a different system. The company buys physical collectibles, like comic books and cars, and invites people to invest in shares of the individual items as they would a stock. When someone makes an offer to buy one of the items outright, Rally takes that offer to the investors, who vote on whether to sell and cash out their share of the profits, or to decline.</p><p>Rally bought the Super Mario Bros. game for $140,000 in April 2020, and investors shot down a $300,000 offer for it last year. The $2 million offer from the anonymous buyer — a collector who is “making big bets in the video game space” — won the approval of three-fourths of the game’s investors, Mr. Petrozzo said.</p><p>Ed Converse, a graduate law student from Green Bay, Wis., invested $100 in the game last year and said he was netting $950 from the sale.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I’m very excited about it,” Mr. Converse, 32, said. “It’s pretty crazy to think that I made an investment in it because of the nostalgia of playing the video game when I was a kid and now it’s selling for $2 million.”</p><p>Mr. Petrozzo thought that the splashy sale could be just the beginning for gaming collectors.</p><p>“In my opinion, it hasn’t reached the masses,” he said. “You’ll start to see a lot more people paying attention and doing research.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It essentially pits two of the world’s richest people against each other: Reliance Chairman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/mukesh-d-ambani" title="">Mukesh Ambani</a>, a business tycoon known for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f70b4ab1-6b5e-4130-a968-b4ccedb2cfca" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his affinity for Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>, and Jeff Bezos, the chairman of Amazon who for many personifies the overwhelming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/science/bezos-amazon.html" title="">wealth</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/technology/big-tech-power.html" title="">power</a> of the technology industry.</p><p>Both Amazon and Reliance Industries want a piece of India’s fast-growing technology and e-commerce market, which is worth billions of dollars. At the heart of the dispute is Future Group, which owns supermarkets, snack shops and fashion outlets in some of India’s biggest cities. The company’s brick-and-mortar footprint is a prize for any company that wants to sell India’s middle-class consumers everything from smartphones to vegetables.</p><p>With its ruling on Friday, legal experts said, the Supreme Court gave foreign businesses support for their ventures in India, where the government has limited foreign investment in a number of industries.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The court said that an interim decision by an arbitrator in Singapore, which effectively put on hold a $3.4 billion sale of Future Group to Reliance Industries, was valid and enforceable in India.</p><p>The judgment is a rare win for foreign businesses in a country that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/technology/india-amazon-walmart-online-retail.html" title="">routinely made attempts to stall their growth</a> and keep them from becoming dominant players in one of the world’s last frontiers for expansion.</p><p>India’s economic growth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/business/economy/india-economy-trade.html" title="">has weakene</a>d in recent years, and the harsh toll of the coronavirus outbreak has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/economy/india-covid19-middle-class.html" title="">hit the country’s middle class hard</a>. Still, businesses see huge potential in its talented work force and the aspirations of 1.4 billion people.</p><p>“Most importantly, it builds the confidence of foreign businesses that their interests will be protected in India, no matter what,” said Salman Waris, a lawyer and partner at TechLegis in New Delhi who specializes in international technology law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Amazon still faces a government antitrust watchdog’s inquiry into its deal with a unit of Future Group.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Amit Dave/Reuters</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>On Friday, Amazon said in a statement that the company welcomed the Supreme Court’s verdict. “We hope that this will hasten a resolution of this dispute with Future Group,” it said.</p></div><div><div><p>Tushar Pania, a Reliance spokesman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Within India’s legal circles, the judgment was seen as another sign of the independence of the country’s judiciary, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/world/asia/india-bhushan-supreme-court.html" title="">criticized</a> in the past for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/world/asia/india-lawyer-trial-tweets.html" title="">eroding free speech</a>.</p><p>India’s judiciary has long been seen as a pillar in the country’s vast but often unruly democracy. It has recently made a series of progressive rulings, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57479762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">granting bail to activists arrested under stringent anti-sedition and terrorism laws</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/world/asia/india-gay-sex-377.html" title="">striking down a ban on consensual gay sex</a> and <a href="https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-aadhaar-right-to-privacy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upholding the right to privacy</a>.</p><p>The battle between Amazon and Reliance Industries is far from over.</p><p>Future Group said in a <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/cb4fbd1d-b38c-47d3-926a-263ad21a8ec4.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stock exchange filing</a> on Friday that the company “intends to pursue all available avenues to conclude the deal” with Reliance. Future Group could appeal the Singapore arbitration court’s decision or file a review petition with India’s Supreme Court. Lawyers are reviewing the best course of action, said Swetank Jain, a spokesman for the company.</p><p>Amazon still faces a government antitrust watchdog’s inquiry into the deal with a unit of Future Group. Late last month, the Competition Commission of India issued a show-cause notice to Amazon, accusing the company of not being upfront about its interest in Future Retail when the agency signed off on the deal in 2019. (Amazon, a dominant force in e-commerce and other areas and holder of an enormous trove of customer data, is a target of antitrust scrutiny in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/business/biden-antitrust-amazon-google.html" title="">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/amazon-eu-antitrust.html" title="">Europe</a> as well.)</p><p>The agency’s chairman, Ashok Kumar Gupta, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Future Group’s supermarkets and other shops could serve as a base for building or expanding an e-commerce empire in India, a potentially lucrative prize. India’s online market is expected to be worth $85.5 billion by 2025, according to Forrester Research. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/technology/facebook-jio-india.html" title="">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/walmart-flipkart-india-amazon.html" title="">Walmart</a> and others are also investing heavily in the country.</p><p>Sanjeev Kumar, a New Delhi-based analyst at Forrester Research, said that Amazon’s push to enter India’s nascent retail market for groceries is aimed at fighting Flipkart, which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/walmart-flipkart-india-amazon.html" title="">controlled by Walmart</a>, another American retail giant. The country’s retail market for groceries is expected to be worth $10 billion by 2025, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest and most powerful companies.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“How much can you grow selling smartphones online?” he said. “The reason you have so many players fighting for grocery is because it’s not a basket that just contains grocery. You’re selling toothpastes, personal care items.”</p><p>Future Group offers access to 1,800 brick-and-mortar stores across India. The company’s prospects dimmed after it loaded up on debt. It struck a deal with Amazon, which invested $200 million in the company in a way that didn’t cross Indian laws against foreign investment. The arrangement included first rights to buy Future Group’s retail assets, if India’s stringent rules on foreign direct investment were to change and allow it.</p><p>But with its stores shuttered because of government coronavirus lockdowns last year and retail sales plummeting, Future Group desperately needed another cash infusion to stay afloat.<span>  </span>Amazon wasn’t able to help, so Future Group turned to Reliance, and last August, a deal was struck. Amazon took its complaints to the arbitrator in Singapore shortly after.</p><p>The decision marks the latest win for foreign business interests in India, where global companies often complain about red tape and regulations that favor homegrown businesses. On Thursday, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6bb63863-c0eb-4e5b-99bd-b023847d3595" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indian lawmakers scrapped retrospective taxation</a>, which had given the government the authority to impose capital gains tax wherever corporate ownership changed hands overseas when the companies involved held business assets in India.</p><p>Retrospective taxation and the country’s history of refusing to accept arbitration awards had damaged India’s image among foreign investors. The government has acknowledged that such foreign investment is critical to India’s post-pandemic economic recovery.</p><p>“Government doesn’t want to tangle with protracted litigation any further,” said Kanchan Gupta, an adviser to India’s information ministry, “and the idea is that this bill will help restore trust in the minds of foreign investors.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>
