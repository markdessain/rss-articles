      <title>Launch HN: BlackOakTV (YC S21) – Netflix for black people</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28087309</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN! We are Uzo and Iyanu, the founders of BlackOakTV (<a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv</a>). BlackOakTV is a subscription video platform serving black audiences by making it easy for them to watch TV shows and movies that feature black stories and characters.<p>Nearly three-quarters of Black people want to watch more content that portrays their lives and experiences (Target Market News, 2018), but they can&#39;t find enough of it, and when they do find it, it usually hasn&#39;t gotten the budget or development resources that more mainstream content does.</p><p>When I grew up in the 90s, it seemed like black people had a relatively high number of TV shows to choose from like &#34;Martin&#34;, &#34;Living Single,&#34; and &#34;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&#34;. It felt good. I felt represented. Unfortunately, it turns out the 90s were an aberration, and over the next 2 decades, black content would become widely underrepresented in Hollywood. Having watched too much TV as a kid, I foolishly decided to get into media as an adult. I worked as a journalist, producer, media strategist and executive, loving to make content, but always being reminded that my culture wasn’t getting the representation it deserved, and always hoping to do something about that someday.</p><p>When I started at YouTube and Google, I thought I would finally be able to help change that; I thought the internet and the world&#39;s biggest video source would bring black people the same awesome experience they were creating for other viewers and creators. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. Black millennial users of YouTube, despite using it more than any other millennial group, often expressed that the comments on YouTube could make it an uncomfortable place. And black creators often did not get the same chance at success that their mainstream counterparts did, leading to some black creators filing lawsuits against YouTube. Despite YouTube&#39;s good intentions, systemic biases in how non-black users treated black creators, as well as the economic realities of Black people only representing 10% of the U.S. audience, have led to YouTube never doing quite enough to address this.</p><p>So I left YouTube, and Iyanu and I decided to address this on our own. The creator economy is booming, with black influencers among the most creative, and black consumers often among the most energetic and prolific users. I knew that energy could be harvested into a platform that gave black viewers the content they want, and creators the chance to make it. So we started BlackOakTV with the goal of delivering the most, and the best, Black content possible.</p><p>We license content from indie creators and make it available in one place, so Black viewers have a one-stop shop for the content they want to see. We&#39;re also creating/commissioning original content, to raise the bar on quality. We&#39;re different from Netflix in that our focus on black content means we can identify new black voices earlier, make it easier to find black content on our platform (hint: it’s everywhere!), and better serve the diversity of black viewers rather than just treating Black people as one single niche. As for the other streaming services targeting black users, our main differentiator from them will eventually be our product. Iyanu is an amazing engineer, and with his prowess, our product will provide a unique viewing experience, full of the features black viewers want.</p><p>But Netflix’s business model is where we aim to be a lot like them. Because Netflix changed media not just because of how they made their content available, but because for the first time in TV history, the aggregator of the content owned a direct relationship with the end user--and that’s why streaming is so valuable. And it’s why we want to have a product that makes users want to view our content exclusively through our properties. Today, users can go to blackoak.tv or download one of our apps, and after subscribing to our 7-day free trial, they can watch all of our content, on-demand, simply by scrolling through our catalog of shows and films. And because we appreciate the HN community taking time to hear our story, for a short period of time, we’re making some of our original black TV shows available for free on our site and in our apps on iOS, Android, Roku and Amazon Firestick. You don’t even have to sign up, just find the &#34;free section&#34; on our homepage or click the following link: <a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes</a>.</p><p>With that, I welcome any feedback, ideas, or experiences similar to ours. It’s been very challenging trying to enter a quickly maturing business with a lot of competition from public companies, and while we think we have some of the answers, your suggestions, thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated!</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <section>
      <p>~4.5 years ago I bought Dell XPS 15. It was a powerhorse without a match for that size/price.</p>
<p>I must admit that I wasn&#39;t happy about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcam is positioned below the screen, recording my typing fingers instead of my face.</li>
<li>Battery getting swollen (and being forced to fly that way wasn&#39;t fun), after replacing it happened again.</li>
<li>The CPU fan is loud and throttles a lot.</li>
<li>There&#39;s only one company in Slovenia that does warranty repairs and takes the law-specified 40 working days to finish their job (replacing a battery, for example).</li>
<li>Too heavy (over 2kg)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to go back to Thinkpads, as they are unmatched by the overall experience and quality to run Linux.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://bgamari.github.io/posts/2020-08-22-what-i-want-in-a-laptop.html">Ben Gamari&#39;s post</a>, I&#39;ve figured out I have the following requirements for the new laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bright screen (400 nits or possibly more), so I can work outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high-resolution screen (UHD), so that I can reasonably split the screen vertically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14&#34; or 15&#34; screen, I&#39;ve still not made up my mind but both of these work well for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light-weight (less than 2kg) so that I can travel light (and hold the laptop with one hand if I have to move a few meters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32 GB of RAM, so that I don&#39;t have to worry about hitting the limit (I don&#39;t even configure swap these days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrete GPU, to make it less convenient to play video games and there&#39;s less power drain from the battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiet fans, I haven&#39;t bothered with this before. XPS was really loud and I&#39;m getting older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best CPU possible, as I&#39;m <a href="https://cachix.org">frequently compiling Haskell</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good battery life (ideally 8h or more), so that I can do my day of work without worrying about a plug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast repair turnaround, I get that with Lenovo in Slovenia with about a day (if they have spare parts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 2 years of warranty, possibly 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thinkpad-p14s">Thinkpad P14s</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve bought a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/coming-soon/P14s-AMD-G2/p/22WSP144SA2">Thinkpad P14s</a>:</p>

<p>CPU benchmarks claim I&#39;m going from <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7700HQ+%40+2.80GHz&amp;id=2906">6945</a> to 
<a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+PRO+5850U&amp;id=4198">19504</a> CPU marks (for comparison, Apple M1 has 15139). Quite impressive!</p>
<p>After a few days of using it, it&#39;s noticeable faster.</p>
<p>Even with the fan at 4500 RPM, it&#39;s completely quiet.</p>
<p>Overall it meets all my requirements except for the battery (while I haven&#39;t tested it, I expect it to last below 8h).</p>
<p>Having a German keyboard is a price I pay for the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_global_chip_shortage">chip shortage</a>,
as it&#39;s hard to get a hold of P14s model with US/UK keyboard (also Brexit). Is there some kind of keys replacements service?</p>
<h3 id="nixos-setup">NixOS Setup</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/42127">NixOS doesn&#39;t yet support Secure Boot</a>, the first thing you need to do is boot into BIOS and disable it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/building-bootable-iso-image">Building bootable ISO image tutorial</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/lenovo/thinkpad/p14s/amd/gen2/default.nix">nixos-hardware support for Thinkad P14s</a> to be able to boot with an ISO
image that has wifi card support.</p>
<p>Installation of NixOS is almost identical to official instructions with <a href="https://gist.github.com/domenkozar/c1da433406807255f9aa835d72976470">a twist of encrypted root partition</a>.</p>
<p>Wifi works (<a href="https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89/issues/30">although there are issues with speed</a>), Bluetooth works, brightness control works, webcam works, trackpad works, suspend works.</p>
<p>Happy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wavefront rendering, see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2013-07_Megakernels-Considered-Harmful/laine2013hpg_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Laine et al. 2013</a></li>
<li>Multiple BVH types
<ul>
<li>Standard binary <em>SAH-based BVH</em></li>
<li><em>SBVH</em> (Spatial BVH), see <a href="https://www.nvidia.in/docs/IO/77714/sbvh.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stich et al. 2009</a>. This BVH is able to split across triangles.</li>
<li><em>QBVH</em> (Quaternary BVH). The QBVH is a four-way BVH that is constructed by iteratively collapsing the Nodes of a binary BVH. The collapsing procedure was implemented as described in <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/multi_rt08.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wald et al. 2008</a>.</li>
<li><em>CWBVH</em> (Compressed Wide BVH), see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/ylitie2017hpg-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ylitie et al. 2017</a>. Eight-way BVH that is constructed by collapsing a binary BVH. Each BVH Node is compressed so that it takes up only 80 bytes per node. The implementation incudes the Dynamic Fetch Heurisic as well as Triangle Postponing (see paper). The CWBVH outperforms all other BVH types.</li>
<li>BVH Optimization. The SAH cost of binary BVH&#39;s can be optimized using a method by <a href="https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/15603/2013-Fast-Insertion-Based-Optimization-of-Bounding-Volume-Hierarchies.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bittner et al. 2012</a>.</li>
<li>All BVH types use Dynamic Ray Fetching to reduce divergence among threads, see <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/76976/HPG2009-Trace-Efficiency.pdf" rel="nofollow">Aila et al. 2009</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two Level Acceleration Structures
<ul>
<li>BVH&#39;s are split into two parts, at the world level (TLAS) and at the model level (BLAS). This allows dynamic scenes with moving Meshes as well as Mesh instancing where multiple meshes with different transforms share the same underlying triangle/BVH data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>SVGF</em> (Spatio-Temporal Variance Guided Filter), see <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/publications/2017/svgf/svgf_preprint.pdf" rel="nofollow">Schied et al</a>. Denoising filter that allows for noise-free images at interactive framerates. Also includes a TAA pass.</li>
<li>Importance Sampling
<ul>
<li><em>Next Event Estimation</em> (NEE): Shadow rays are explicitly aimed at light sources to reduce variance.</li>
<li><em>Multiple Importance Sampling</em> (MIS): Explicit light sampling (NEE) is combined with standard BRDF sampling using MIS to get the best of both.</li>
<li>Cosine weighted direction sampling for diffuse bounces.</li>
<li>Microfacet sampling as described in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf" rel="nofollow">Walter et al. 2007</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Mipmapping</em>: Textures are sampled using mipmapping. Mipmap sampling is done using ray cones (see <a href="http://www.jcgt.org/published/0010/01/01/" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2012</a>, <a href="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/ea/seed/presentations/2019-ray-tracing-gems-chapter-20-akenine-moller-et-al.pdf" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2019</a>). Primary rays perform anisotropic sampling, subsequent bounces use isotropic sampling.</li>
<li><em>Blue Noise Sampling</em>: The low discrepency sampler by <a href="https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/762-2/" rel="nofollow">Heitz et al. 2019</a> is used. This sampler distributes Monte Carlo errors as a blue noise in screen space.</li>
<li>Hot Reloading: When F5 is pressed the CUDA module is destroyed, recompiled, and reloaded.</li>
<li>Multiple Material types
<ul>
<li><em>Diffuse</em></li>
<li><em>Dielectrics</em></li>
<li><em>Microfacets</em> (GGX)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitsuba XML Scene support: A custom Mitsuba XML parser is included to load scene files.</li>

      <title>Tools to Run Kubernetes Locally</title>
      <link>https://yankee.dev/6-tools-to-run-kubernetes-locally</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><p></p><p></p></div><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628148249210/-JvsBHAz6.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp"/><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss<!-- --> <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Kubernetes is a big and complicated technology and it clearly requires some time and dedication to wrap your head around. There is no vendor lock-in meaning it runs the same no matter which managed cloud platform you use it on. This means using it locally will be no different from using it on the cloud.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools for running Kubernetes on your local machine, but it basically boils down to two approaches on how it is done: </p>
<ol>
<li>running it from a single binary package </li>
<li>running it as a container using Docker in Docker (DinD)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="kubernetes-marketplace">Kubernetes Marketplace</h3>

<p>Before we move on to talk about all the tools, it will be beneficial if you installed <code>arkade</code> on your machine. It will help you get these tools with a single command. </p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="features">Features?</h2>
<p>All of the tools listed here more or less offer the same feature, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Multi-Node cluster</li>
<li>Persistent volumes </li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Certificates</li>
<li>Bare-metal support</li>
<li>Dashboard </li>
<li>Kubernetes Versions</li>
<li>Add-ons</li>
<li>Cross-platform</li>
<li>Tracks upstream Kubernetes</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="single-package-binary">Single package binary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s">k3s</a> </strong>
</p>
<p>k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution from Rancher Labs. It is specifically targeted for running on IoT and Edge devices, meaning it is a perfect candidate for your Raspberry Pi or a virtual machine. </p>
<p>It comes with a single binary of mere &lt;40 MB and takes as low as 500 MB of RAM.  </p>
<p>You can bootstrap k3s quickly using  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup">k3sup</a> !</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3sup
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s">k0s</a> </strong>

k0s is the latest entry on the block. By name, you might think it&#39;s a more stripped version of k3s, but it&#39;s an entirely different distribution from an entirely different company, called Mirantis. Contrary to the name, it comes in a larger binary of 150 MB+.</p>
<p>It can be run as a binary or in DinD mode. k0s takes security seriously and out of the box, it meets the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/definitions/what-does-mean-fips-compliant/">FIPS compliance</a>.  Although, a new distribution, k0s has reached the production-ready status, so there wouldn&#39;t be an issue for development usage. </p>
<pre><code>arkade get k0s
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s">Microk8s</a> </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  MicroK8s is a Kubernetes distribution by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. You already saw this coming; it can only be installed using <code>snap</code>.  It comes with loads of add-ons baked in like Fluentd, Grafana and Prometheus. </p>
<p>If you are on Ubuntu or its derivatives that uses <code>snap</code> you&#39;ll feel right at home using MicroK8s.</p>
<pre><code>  sudo snap install microk8s --classic
</code></pre>
<h2 id="docker-in-docker-dind">Docker in Docker (DinD)</h2>
<p>Running Docker inside of Docker (Inception anyone?) is a popular way of bootstrapping Kubernetes. The isolating nature of Docker makes running a multi-node cluster a breeze on a single machine, and also ensures the running instance does not affect the machine itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the title suggests, you need to have Docker installed on your machine to go this route.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">minikube</a> </strong>

Despite running on top of Docker and similar container technologies, minikube is really flexible in how it operates and supports multiple virtualization drivers making it adaptable to different computing environments.  These include KVM2, Virtualbox, Podman, Hyperkit, Hyper-V and many more.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get minikube
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind">KinD</a></strong>

Kubernetes in Docker (KinD) is similar to minikube but it does not spawn VM&#39;s to run clusters and works only with Docker.  KinD for the most part has the least bells and whistles and offers an intuitive developer experience in getting started with Kubernetes in no time.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get kind
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d/">k3d</a> </strong>

k3d is basically running k3s inside of Docker. It provides an instant benefit over using k3s on a local machine, that is, multi-node clusters. Running inside Docker, we can easily spawn multiple instances of our k3s Nodes.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3d
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Either you choose a single binary package or DinD approach, Kubernetes has made itself pretty accessible. For new learners, the barrier to entry is low, and the feedback loop is instantaneous. </p>
<p>I hope this article has been helpful in deciding which tool to use for running your local Kubernetes instance.</p>

      <title>Reflections on 10k Hours of Programming</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours — Malcolm Gladwell in Outsiders</blockquote><p>Well, I&#39;m certainly not a world-class expert, but I have put my 10,000 hours of deliberate practice into programming. Here are 31 of my reflections on programming.</p><p>These are reflections only about <strong>pure coding</strong> — no lessons sum up to &#34;programming is about people&#34; or &#34;how to be a senior technical leader&#34; (arguably more important to a career, but not the topic of this post).<em> </em></p><p><em>These reflections are just about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours</em>. Most don&#39;t apply to beginners. These reflections are not career advice. Think of them as lessons on being a technical guitarist, not about being a good band member. They are about becoming a better programmer for yourself.</p><ol><li>Browsing the source is almost always faster than finding an answer on StackOverflow.</li><li>In many cases, what you&#39;re working on doesn&#39;t have an answer on the internet. That usually means the problem is hard or important, or both.</li><li>Delete as much code as you can.</li><li>Syntactic sugar is usually bad.</li><li>Simple is hard.</li><li>Have a wide variety of tools and know which ones to use for the job.</li><li>Know the internals of the most used ones like git and bash (I can get out of the most gnarly git rebase or merge).</li><li>Build your own tools for repeated workflows. There is nothing faster than using a tool you made yourself (see: <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/about/">software</a> I wrote).</li><li>Only learn from the best. So when I was learning Go, I read the standard library.</li><li>If it looks ugly, it is most likely a terrible mistake.</li><li>If you have to write a comment that isn&#39;t a docstring, it should probably be refactored. Every new line of comments increases this probability. </li><li>If you don&#39;t understand how your program runs in production, you don&#39;t understand the program itself. In my experience, the best engineers know how their program works in every environment.</li><li>The above rule applies to the build pipeline as well.</li><li>Use other people&#39;s code religiously.</li><li>Corollary: Most code out there is terrible. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to write a better version yourself.</li><li>A rough rule of thumb: never take a direct dependency on a small library that you could easily rewrite or a large library that should have been small.</li><li>Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.</li><li>Organizing your code into modules, packages, and functions is important. Knowing where API boundaries will materialize is an art.</li><li>Pick the most efficient tool most of the time, but also pick what you know. Is Arch Linux the most efficient operating system for the modern developer? For me, it is, but for most, probably not. Should you use acme? Only if you&#39;re Rob Pike.</li><li>Avoid cyclomatic complexity. Novice coders don&#39;t even know that they&#39;ve tangled the dependency graph until it&#39;s too late.</li><li>Avoid nesting conditionals deeply. Have common sense about your conditional tests and naming convention.</li><li>Name variables correctly. Again, an art.</li><li>While rare, sometimes it&#39;s a problem with the compiler. Otherwise, it&#39;s always DNS.</li><li>Use esoteric language features sparingly, but use them when you&#39;re supposed to, for that is the point.</li><li>Technology does not diffuse equally. For example, there is a lot that frontend developers could learn from low-level engineers (especially now that everything is compiled). Likewise, there are UX and usability features that JavaScript developers could teach cloud engineers.</li><li>As a result, different kinds of engineers look at the world differently.</li><li>Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others. I know because I&#39;ve been both a 10x programmer and a -1x programmer.</li><li>There&#39;s no correlation between being a 10x programmer and a 10x employee (maybe a negative one).</li><li>Good APIs are easy to use and hard to misuse.</li><li>The configuration cycle goes from hardcoded values to environment variables, to CLI flags, to a configuration file, to a templated configuration file, to a DSL, to a generic bash script, and back to hardcoded values. Know where you are on this <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/heptagon-of-configuration/">Heptagon of Configuration</a>.</li><li>All layers of abstraction are malleable. If you run into a fundamental wall, sometimes the answer is to go down a layer of abstraction. You aren&#39;t confined to the surface.</li></ol><p><strong>Where did I put in my 10,000 hours?</strong> Well, I&#39;ve been programming for about 15 years. Most recently, I worked as a professional software engineer at Google on Kubernetes and Blackstone, the private equity firm. Before that, I spent most of college in the library writing programs for my own projects instead of writing proofs (which I should have been doing as a math major). And before that, I was hacking away at all sorts of things — <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/runescape-machine-learning/">running a botnet on RuneScape</a>, writing a Latin translation app for the iPhone (so I could do better on my Latin exams), <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/virgo-lang/">writing my own configuration language</a>, creating a web clipper, or <a href="https://eirenicon.org/2020/01/29/ricing-desktops/">ricing up my desktop</a>.</p><p><strong>What did I do for the 10,000 hours?</strong> The most recent work was in distributed systems, but I&#39;ve written code across the stack. Languages like PHP, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Swift. Frontend, backend, mobile, kernel, cloud, ops, and even some IT. I&#39;ve worked on large-scale open-source projects like Kubernetes and maintained subprojects, which allowed me to have my code peer-reviewed by some of the best engineers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Launch HN: Arengu (YC S21) – Frictionless Signup Flows</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28086676</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, we&#39;re Jacobo, Sergio &amp; Pablo, founders of Arengu (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>). We let you build cutting-edge signup flows as Airbnb, Stripe, or Slack for your SaaS, without dedicating a full engineering team.<p>Building an application requires coding boring flows like signup, logins, payments, and waiting lists. As applications grow, more complex flows are required, and most of the time they can only be edited by engineering teams. If something breaks, sometimes it takes time to notice. Measuring where users drop off can be tricky. Growth and marketing teams want autonomy to sign up users in landing pages, test new flows and get insights into what performs better.</p><p>At our previous jobs, we were constantly asked by clients to customize the signup, adding logic or integrations. We didn&#39;t find a good solution to cover the UI and custom logic with APIs other than coding from scratch. So we built a low-code platform, suitable for non-engineering teams, where you can build all the UI and integrations with a visual interface. Then you embed the flow in your site where you want it to appear with just a line of code.</p><p>Key features include: email or phone verification with OTPs; Stripe integration to enroll users in trial subscriptions; rate limiting to avoid spam or brute force attacks; approvals to build a waiting list and manually approve or reject signups; analytics events to track any user interaction with your flows; native integrations to send data back and forth between us and your apps; custom HTML/JS to extend your flows’ capabilities.</p><p>We make money based on the volume of submissions you have per month or based on product capabilities (eg. adding payment flows in your signup).</p><p>Watch our product intro video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo</a>) or if you scroll down our homepage (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>) to “Try a sign-up flow demo” you can see what the product looks like to the end-user and play around - it’s not to sign up to Arengu :P. There are more demos for every of the common use cases we have (<a href="https://www.arengu.com/use-cases" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com/use-cases</a>).</p><p>We would love to get feedback about your experience building signups flows: painful parts (eg. UI, logic, security, etc), complex flows (eg. KYC, OTPs, data verification, etc); anything you would like to share with us, or if you think we can help you, feel free to reach out at jacobo [at] arengu.com :)</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</p>
<p><a href="https://trogon.app/" rel="nofollow">https://trogon.app/</a> is a tool for learning to identify birds. You select a
location or region anywhere in the world on the map, and are taken to an
identification challenge (audio or visual) featuring bird species
occurring there.</p>
<p>By default the challenge is audio-only, but this can be changed in the
settings (<i></i> at the top of the page), along with
English vs scientific name preferences, etc.</p>

  </p><ol>
    <li>Zoom in on some area of the world.</li>
    <li>
      Right click / long press (phone) to load nearby

   <p>A couple of weeks ago, Edgar Dworsky walked into a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store in Somerville, Mass., like a detective entering a murder scene. </p>   <p>He stepped into the cereal aisle, where he hoped to find the smoking gun. He scanned the shelves. Oh no, he thought. He was too late. The store had already replaced old General Mills cereal boxes — such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs — with newer ones. It was as though the suspect&#39;s fingerprints had been wiped clean.</p>   <p>Then Dworsky headed toward the back of the store. Sure enough, old boxes of Cocoa Puffs and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios were stacked at the end of one of the aisles. He grabbed an old box of Cocoa Puffs and put it side by side with the new one. Aha! The tip he had received was right on the money. General Mills had downsized the contents of its &#34;family size&#34; boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces. </p>   <p>Dworsky went to the checkout aisle, and both boxes — gasp! — were the same price. It was an open-and-shut case: General Mills is yet another perpetrator of &#34;shrinkflation.&#34;</p>      <div id="res1012410291">

   <h3>Downsizing and shrinkflation mean the same thing</h3>   <p>Dworsky is a former Massachusetts assistant attorney general and longtime consumer advocate. He has spent decades tracking instances of companies shrinking products on his website <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432979f03f664d49dcc5e5c79f39a18dd28b4271efc31369b940439b84ef03106dbcaf749cb0c4b65cddf8ad9f5779632f">Mouseprint</a>. He refers to it by its original name, downsizing, but economist Pippa Malmgren rechristened it &#34;shrinkflation&#34; about a decade ago, and the term stuck. Downsizing and shrinkflation both refer to the same thing: companies reducing the size or quantity of their products while charging the same price or even more.</p>   <p>&#34;Downsizing is really a sneaky price increase,&#34; Dworsky says. &#34;Consumers tend to be price conscious. But they&#39;re not net-weight conscious. They can tell instantly if they&#39;re used to paying $2.99 for a carton of orange juice and that goes up to $3.19. But if the orange juice container goes from 64 ounces to 59 ounces, they&#39;re probably not going to notice.&#34;</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor&#39;s note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>&#39;s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>   <p>If consumers were the rational creatures depicted in classic economic theory, they would notice shrinkflation. They would keep their eyes on the price per Cocoa Puff and not fall for gimmicks in how companies package those Cocoa Puffs. A <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431bda99a81a3e11ccaa9d0a3100c38f5fce925be8af2571a53314c2a5241140d144dd2a80d4a3d73f92a9c5ce53a3b7a8">study</a> by John T. Gourville and Jonathan J. Koehler analyzed data from the market for cereal and other sectors and found that consumers are much more gullible than classic theory predicts. They are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity. Companies, of course, have known this for years.</p>      <h3>The case of the shrinking toilet paper roll</h3>   <p>Back in the day, Dworsky says, he remembers buying bigger candy bars and bigger rolls of toilet paper. The original Charmin roll of toilet paper, he says, had <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074380bdb227e78c01698090ddf0cd7729dde6a63e0f63ec19f02c2726185ba8f8ef8871b7fe92c8264edb806abb7712740b">650 sheets</a>. Now you have to pay extra for &#34;Mega Rolls&#34; and &#34;Super Mega Rolls&#34; — and even those have many fewer sheets than the original. To add insult to injury, Charmin recently <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507436430d5921dd0eb3903b2624508e06d573d78c79c31a38a42d205f2db8be79b17c97dce8733c2adb9a32af3dadb13b309">shrank the size</a> of their toilet sheets. Talk about a crappy deal.</p>   <p>Shrinkflation, or downsizing, is probably as old as mass consumerism. Over the years, Dworsky has documented the downsizing of everything from Doritos to baby shampoo to ranch dressing. &#34;The downsizing tends to happen when manufacturers face some type of pricing pressure,&#34; he says. For example, if the price of gasoline or grain goes up.</p>   <p>That is why, when the government began reporting surges in inflation several months ago, Dworsky was on the lookout for its devious, shrinkifying cousin. We&#39;re now seeing a wave of shrinkflation, from <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb0650743229b1d1113e35515b00072bd3d30004d4181b17d3a73d24aa2e22b551c0ae1af34db14311eacdaa89aed18e52aa23e71">Tillamook ice cream</a> to <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431e1f4f0280b3498124614ee117ed5303c3e2d79c0d7bd2e407ce14d19838c96f8dfeffe564bee25d18866e5c810739bb">Royal Canin cat food</a>. &#34;As we&#39;re seeing inflation picking up now, that&#39;s why I think you&#39;re going to see more items being downsized,&#34; Dworksy says. &#34;And maybe it&#39;s going to be a double-whammy: We&#39;re going to see some products going up in price at the same time that you&#39;re actually getting less in the package.&#34;</p>   <h3>A taller cereal box does not always mean more cereal</h3>   <p>Not all consumers are oblivious to shrinkflation. </p>   <p>Jonathan Fitzer is a big fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, another cereal made by General Mills. A couple of weeks ago, he went to a local grocery store in Tampa, Fla., to re-up. But on the shelf were two different versions of the product. The old box was the same as always. The new box, however, was taller and skinnier. And it was adorned with a picture advertising <em>Space Jam</em>, a new movie reboot starring LeBron James. Fitzer might have been forgiven for assuming a taller cereal box meant more cereal. &#34;And then I looked at the bottom and I saw the numbers were off and I was like, &#39;oh, come on now. I&#39;m getting ripped off here,&#39;&#34; he says.</p>   <p>Fitzer follows the &#34;<a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432f2bfd26774ea4b8146bf3e8dc7c43362b5295f18affbd056a03bee12a66164047608564f148cf679ae136883c160bd5">r/shrinkflation</a>&#34; thread on Reddit, and he uploaded a picture of the two boxes on the site. &#34;That&#39;s crazy shrinkage,&#34; <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507433752e0d0d585ecb379c99c8ac2424c4748126cbe843d99df8fb7ac73e5b6ed765014ce44f31544a76d3abc304ed111b7">said one commenter</a>. Another had words for the makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch: &#34;Why ya being shady, yo?&#34;</p>   <div id="res1012410339">

   <p>Last week, <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432b19006ec32478bb0ef7e1247060a85e399c5a1c4cb8b79bef504ee8cb0910db43548194adaed454d041e5aebc72be01">General Mills announced</a> the rising cost of ingredients, packaging, labor, and trucking was forcing it to revamp its business. It said that it was taking &#34;pricing actions&#34; and other steps to grapple with this inflation. We reached out to General Mills about reports that it&#39;s downsizing its cereals as part of its strategy.</p>   <p>&#34;General Mills has been working to create consistency and standardization across our cereal products, making it easier for shoppers to distinguish between sizes on shelf. For consumers seeking the best price per ounce, the most value is normally in our larger boxes of cereal,&#34; says Kelsey Roemhildt, a General Mills spokesperson. &#34;This change also allows more efficient truck loading leading to fewer trucks on the road and fewer gallons of fuel used, which is important in both reducing global emissions as well as offsetting increased costs associated with inflation.&#34;</p>   <p>General Mills&#39; reframing of its shrinkflation seems to be pretty typical of Corporate America. Companies often sell downsizing as a way to help the environment, offer consumers more choice, or improve the quality of their products. When a spokesperson for Charmin, for example, was confronted by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074353590c90100e375352895576ae8d747bdf88b7848805445710e057dc19de67a4c2010405c4fb5d464678205f59a5ca49">reporters at WBUR</a> about shrinking the size of their toilet sheet squares, she suggested it was the result of &#34;innovations&#34; that allow consumers to, basically, wipe their butts more efficiently.</p>   <p>If this keeps up, maybe someday we&#39;ll all be living in a Lilliputian dystopia where we&#39;re forced to eat miniature candy bars, drink tiny drinks, and wipe our bottoms with teeny-tiny squares of paper. Or maybe consumers will start to notice and voice concern and the power of consumer demand will force companies to listen and right-size their products. Until then, our prayers are with the lovers of Cocoa Puffs.</p>   <p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter segment? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

      <title>SEC Charges Decentralized Finance Lender for Raising $30M</title>
      <link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>Case Is Agency’s First Involving Securities Using DeFi Technology</h2></p><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Aug. 6, 2021 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Florida men and their Cayman Islands company for unregistered sales of more than $30 million of securities using smart contracts and so-called “decentralized finance” (DeFi) technology, and for misleading investors concerning the operations and profitability of their business DeFi Money Market.   </p>

<p>According to the SEC’s order, Gregory Keough, Derek Acree, and their company Blockchain Credit Partners offered and sold securities in unregistered offerings through DeFi Money Market from February 2020 to February 2021. The order finds that they used smart contracts to sell two types of digital tokens: mTokens that could be purchased using specified digital assets and that paid 6.25 percent interest, and DMG “governance tokens” that purportedly gave holders certain voting rights, a share of excess profits, and the ability to profit from DMG governance token resales in the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the order, in offering and selling mTokens and DMG governance tokens, the respondents stated that DeFi Money Market could pay the interest and profits because it would use investor assets to buy “real world” assets that generated income, like car loans.  However, the order finds that after publicly unveiling DMM, the respondents realized that DeFi Money Market could not operate as promised because the price volatility of the digital assets used to purchase the tokens created risk that the income generated through income-generating assets would be insufficient to cover appreciation of investors’ principal.  The order finds that rather than notifying investors of this roadblock, the respondents misrepresented how the company was operating, including by falsely claiming that DeFi Money Market had bought car loans that they displayed on DeFi Money Market’s website.  While the respondents controlled another company that owned car loans, DeFi Money Market never acquired an ownership interest in any of those loans. Instead, the order finds that the respondents used personal funds and funds from the other company they controlled to make principal and interest payments for mToken redemptions. </p>

<p>“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws – no matter what technologies are used to offer and sell those securities,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “This allows investors to make informed decisions and prevents issuers from misleading the public about business operations.”</p>

<p>“The federal securities laws apply with equal force to age-old frauds wrapped in today’s latest technology,” said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. “Here, the labeling of the offering as decentralized and the securities as governance tokens did not hinder us from ensuring that DeFi Money Market was immediately shut down and that investors were paid back.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s order finds that the mTokens were notes and were also offered and sold as investment contracts, the DMG governance tokens were offered and sold as investment contracts, and the respondents violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by conducting unregistered offers and sales of both types of digital assets. The SEC’s order also finds that Respondents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</p>

<p>Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC’s order, respondents consented to a cease-and-desist order that includes disgorgement totaling $12,849,354 and penalties of $125,000 each for Keough and Acree. In addition, prior to the issuance of this order, the respondents funded the smart contracts so that mToken holders could redeem their mTokens and receive all principal and interest owed.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Brent Mitchell, Stephanie Reinhart, and Gregory Smolar and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Ana Petrovic of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit with assistance from trial counsel Kristin Murnahan and the Enforcement Division’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. </p>

<p>I just added half-precision floats to Futhark, as the type <code>f16</code>. This wasn’t particularly hard (perhaps a day of work), but it was <em>annoying</em> for fairly shallow technical reasons, so as a bit of catharsis, here’s a blog post about the challenges I encountered.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a href="#why" id="why-link" title="why">Why</a></h3>
<p>First of all, why do we even <em>want</em> 16-bit floats? Their precision is horrible and the largest representable value is a mere 65504. Apparently 16-bit floats were used by various exotic processors in the early 80s, but the modern lineage, as eventually standardised by IEEE 754-2008, hails from graphics programming. This is because half-precision floats can be useful for expressing light intensities, as they are <em>accurate enough</em>, while allowing much larger dynamic range than a 16-bit fixed point number. Initially, half-precision was only used as a storage format, but eventually GPUs grew support for operating directly on half-precision floats; often with twice the arithmetic throughput. Since they only take up half as much space in memory as single-precision floats (and hence also use half the memory bandwidth), they are in theory “twice as fast” as single-precision floats.</p>
<p>Half-precision floats have also become increasingly popular for use in machine learning applications, as it appears neural networks are resistant to numerical problems (presumably they just train around them). But this is where things get interesting: there are actually (at least) <em>two</em> half-precision float formats. All take up 16 bits in memory, but differ in how they allocate those bits to significand and exponent. The one we support in Futhark is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format#ARM_alternative_half-precision">the <em>binary16</em> format from IEEE 754-2008</a>, but Google has also developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format">bfloat16</a> for use in AI accelerators. ARM apparently also supports a nonstandard variation of binary16, but I’m hoping I will never have to learn the details.</p>
<p>So we want to support half-precision floats because some applications can make use of them, either because they take up less space or because computation on them is actually faster.</p>
<h3 id="how"><a href="#how" id="how-link" title="how">How</a></h3>
<p>Half-precision floats are standardised in IEEE 754-2008, but they are <em>not</em> a universally supported type in common programming languages. In particular, ISO C does not support them. Other languages have unusual restrictions where <code>half</code> is supported as a “storage type” (meaning you can put them in memory), but you need to convert them to some other type (e.g. <code>float</code>) if you actually want to do arithmetic on them. This is not how we want to do it in Futhark. The <code>f16</code> type should be fully supported like any other primitive type, and on all systems. When necessary, the compiler must generate code to paper over lack of hardware support.</p>
<h4 id="c"><a href="#c" id="c-link" title="c">C</a></h4>
<p>Most of Futhark’s backends generate C code - either plain CPU C, OpenCL C, or CUDA C. Let’s start with plain C, which does not support a <code>half</code> type. One option would be representing <code>f16</code> as a 16-bit integer and then implementing every single arithmetic operation manually. <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">People have done so</a>, but such code runs extremely slowly. Instead, we simply <code>typedef float f16</code> and actually perform the <code>f16</code> operations in single precision. However, we don’t want these simulated floats to take up 32 bits per element in memory, so we distinguish between the <em>scalar type</em> used for operations, which is <code>float</code>, and the <em>storage type</em> used for arrays, which is <code>uint16_t</code>. When reading an <code>f16</code> from an array, we must use a function to convert from the storage type to the scalar type - fortunately, the library linked above contained such a function and its inverse. This means that <code>f16</code> operations might produce different results depending on whether they are emulated or not, as emulation only performs the rounding at the end, while true <code>f16</code> calculations might also round intermediate results. I’m not sufficiently experienced with numerical analysis, or the guarantees of IEEE 754, to say whether this is a real problem.</p>
<p>We also have a problem with <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-09-26-calling-futhark-from-c-and-haskell.html">Futhark’s C API</a>. Normally an entry point that returns a scalar will be exposed as a C function that produces a value of the obvious type (<code>int32_t</code> for <code>i32</code> and so on), but C does not have a <code>half</code> type. Again we fall back to the notion of “storage type” and return <code>f16</code> results as <code>uint16_t</code>. Life would be so much easier if <code>half</code> was universally supported.</p>
<h4 id="opencl"><a href="#opencl" id="opencl-link" title="opencl">OpenCL</a></h4>
<p>Let’s move on to the OpenCL backend. Surely life is easier there! No, it never is. OpenCL <em>does</em> actually define a <code>half</code> type, but only as a storage format, meaning you can have pointers to them, but not perform any arithmetic, unless the platform in question supports the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/cl_khr_fp16.html"><code>cl_khr_fp16</code></a> extension (and you enable it). OpenCL platforms are loaded dynamically followed by run-time compilation at kernels, so the Futhark compiler does not know at compile-time whether the target platform supports half-precision. Therefore we generate <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/scalar_f16.h#L11-L34">kernel code with plenty of #ifdefs</a> to detect whether the platform supports <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, and fall back to <code>float</code>-based emulation otherwise. Remarkably, OpenCL <em>does</em> provide builtin functions for <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/vload_half.html">efficiently translating between single-precision and half-precision floats stored in memory</a>, even for those platforms that don’t have <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>. This lets us load half-precision floats into single-precision scalars at quite high speed. I noticed about an order of magnitude difference compared to the hand-written conversion function. This is quite important, since for some reason, NVIDIA’s OpenCL implementation does <em>not</em> support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, despite their GPUs being fully capable.</p>
<p>As a delightful quirk, the OpenCL emulator <a href="https://github.com/jrprice/Oclgrind">Oclgrind</a> claims to support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, but will fail to actually perform any operations on <code>half</code> values. Futhark users will never use Oclgrind, but it is an absolutely indispensable tool for hacking on the compiler, and is used in our regression test suite as well. The solution is an <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/master/rts/c/opencl.h#L739-L743">ad-hoc check to always emulate half-precision on Oclgrind</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cuda"><a href="#cuda" id="cuda-link" title="cuda">CUDA</a></h4>
<p>Okay, time for CUDA. NVIDIA has been marketing half-precision hard, so <em>surely</em> everything will just work out, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, CUDA does indeed support half-precision floats on devices that are Compute Capability 6.0 or newer. This can be checked with an <code>#ifdef</code>. However, for some strange reason, you have to include a special header file, <code>cuda_fp16.h</code>, to actually get access to the <code>half</code> type and its operations. Glancing at the header file, it looks like <code>half</code> is actually implemented as a C++ class with inline PTX (CUDA assembly) to perform the computations using the natively supported half-precision instructions. This is quite baroque. Why isn’t the <code>half</code> type just implemented in the compiler, like it is in OpenCL?</p>
<p>I <em>suspect</em> the reason is that CUDA is mostly a “single source” programming model where the same program contains both CPU and GPU code, where the CPU code is ultimately compiled with the system compiler - which does not support half-precision floats. In contrast, OpenCL C is specifically for “device” code (read: GPU code), and the “host” (CPU) is completely out of its purview. Futhark does not use CUDA in a “single source” manner, but instead uses <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html">NVRTC</a> to do run-time compilation of CUDA kernels, very similar to how OpenCL works.</p>
<p>The need to include <code>cuda_fp16.h</code> is not just a compiler implementation curiosity - it turns out to present the <em>greatest</em> annoyance in this entire cavalcade of accidental complexity. Apparently when you run-time compile a CUDA kernel with NVRTC, the default search path does not include the CUDA include directory, so <em>this header cannot be found</em>. Whoever calls the NVRTC API must explicitly provide the directory containing this header. This is <em>bad</em>. I’ve long sought to ensure Futhark didn’t <a href="https://gist.github.com/cookrn/4015437">contribute to the growing accidental complexity disaster</a>, with new configuration files and environment variables being my main aversion.</p>
<p>But now it seems we have no choice. Futhark <em>must</em> be able to figure out, at run-time, where CUDA is installed, and there is no standard for this. Sure, it’s often in <code>/usr/local/cuda</code>, but it’s fairly common to put it somewhere in <code>/opt</code> as well, especially on supercomputer systems. And there is <em>no standard environment variable</em> pointing at the CUDA directory! Other GPU applications respect any or all or <code>CUDA_HOME</code>, <code>CUDA_PATH</code>, and <code>CUDA_ROOT</code>. And, to my great regret, <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/cuda.h#L348-L358">now Futhark does as well</a>.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy and a shame. There is no good reason that is has to be this way. I <em>know</em> that this will result in things not working down the line, just because a user didn’t set an invisible global variable correctly. I still hope that I just missed a subtle detail somewhere, and that this will eventually go away like a bad dream.</p>

<p>Half-precision floats are the worst IEEE floats in all ways except speed. So are they faster in Futhark? Sort of. On an A100 GPU, the expression <code>f16.sum</code> can sum one billion half-precision floats in <em>2.1ms</em>, while <code>f32.sum</code> takes <em>2.9ms</em> to sum one billion single-precision floats. That’s a speedup of <em>1.38x</em>, which is much less than the <em>2x</em> we would theoretically expect. So what’s going wrong? Two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Adding two half-precision floats on their own is probably not faster than adding two single-precision floats. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF.html#group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF">CUDA’s half-precision API</a> strongly implies one should consider using <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC.html#group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC">the <code>half2</code> type</a>, which packs two half-precision numbers in 32 bits, and allows “vectorised” operations on both in a single instruction. As far as I understand current hardware, this is the way half-precision floats can achieve high arithmetic throughput. I don’t know if the CUDA compiler will optimise multiple <code>half</code>s into <code>half2</code>s on its own, but I doubt it - especially for a reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis above is valid, but it’s not actually what is happening here. This summation is <em>completely</em> bandwidth-bound, so the only thing that matters is how efficiently we access memory. In <code>f16.sum</code>, each thread reads a 16-bit value at a time. While the Futhark compiler arranges things so that the accesses are fully <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu/coalesced">coalesced</a>, the GPU’s memory architecture is not really designed for individual threads issuing such small reads - perhaps each thread will actually read (at least) 32 bits, then throw half of it away. In any case, the result is that the memory bus is not fully utilised.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A more efficient half-precision reduction would have each thread read multiple packed values with a single transaction, such as by reading a 32-bit <code>half2</code>. This is a trick we’ll have to teach the compiler at some point. This is also not a new concern - if you write a program that sums 8-bit or 16-bit integers, you are also not fully utilising the memory bus, even if in absolute runtime, it’s still faster than summing the same number of 32-bit integers.</p>
<p>How do we verify that this analysis is correct? We can write a program that interprets an array of <code>u32</code> values as packed <code>f16</code>s, using a <code>map</code>-<code>reduce</code> composition:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>map (\x -&gt; f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x&gt;&gt;<span>16</span>)) +</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>           f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x)))</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>&gt;-&gt; f16.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can sum the equivalent of a billion <code>f16</code>s (that is, half a billion <code>u32</code>s) in a mere <em>1.5ms</em> - a <em>1.93x</em> speedup over <code>f32</code> summation.</p>
<h3 id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats"><a href="#so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats" id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats-link" title="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats">So should you use single-precision floats?</a></h3>
<p>Unless you know what you are doing, you probably should not use <code>f16</code> in your code. Their numerical properties are absolutely going to bite you. Interoperability is awkward and the performance isn’t even that great <em>yet</em>. But from a language perspective they are now fully supported, and hopefully we’ll make them run even faster in a not too distant future. But I doubt we’ll add more bits, so the numerics are always going to be dubious.</p>

	<p>Postgres.app is a full-featured PostgreSQL installation packaged as a standard Mac app.
It includes everything you need to get started:
we’ve even included popular extensions like <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> for geo data and <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">plv8</a> for JavaScript.</p>

<p>Postgres.app has a beautiful user interface and a convenient menu bar item.
You never need to touch the command line to use it – but of course we do include all the necessary <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">command line tools</a> and header files for advanced users.</p>

<p>Postgres.app can install minor updates automatically, so you get bugfixes as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="installing-postgresapp">Installing Postgres.app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Download   ➜   Move to Applications folder   ➜   Double Click</p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t move Postgres.app to the Applications folder, you will see a warning about an unidentified developer and won&#39;t be able to open it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click &#34;Initialize&#34; to create a new server</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Configure your <tt>$PATH</tt> to use the included command line tools (optional):</p>
		<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &amp;&amp;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Done! You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with these default settings:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>Host</td>
		<td>localhost</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Port</td>
		<td>5432</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User</td>
		<td>your system user name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database</td>
		<td>same as user</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>none</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Connection URL</td>
		<td>postgresql://localhost</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To connect with psql, double click a database. To connect directly from the command line, type <code>psql</code>. If you’d rather use a graphical client, see below.</p>

<p>NOTE: These instructions assume that you’ve never installed PostgreSQL on your Mac before.
If you have previously installed PostgreSQL using homebrew, MacPorts, the EnterpriseDB installer, consider <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/remove.html">removing other PostgreSQL installations</a> first.
We also have <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/update.html">instructions for upgrading from older versions of Postgres.app</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphical-clients">Graphical Clients</h2>

<p>Postgres.app includes <code>psql</code>, a versatile command line client for PostgreSQL.
But it’s not the only option; there are plenty of great graphical clients available for PostgreSQL.
Two popular tools are:</p>

<ul>
	<li id="pgadmin"><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a></li>
	<li id="postico"><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a> is a feature rich open source PostgreSQL client.
It has support for almost every feature in PostgreSQL.
The only downside is that the cross-plattform UI really doesn’t live up to the expectations of a native Mac app.</p>

<p><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> on the other hand, is a very modern Mac app.
It’s made by the same people that maintain Postgres.app, and we think you’ll like it! 
We put a lot of effort into making it a joy to use.
However, it doesn’t have the extensive feature set of pgAdmin, and it’s a commercial app rather than open source.</p>

<p>Aside from those two options, there are a lot more to choose from! Check the documentation for a <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/gui-tools.html">list of amazing Mac apps for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-connect">How to connect</h2>

<p>After your PostgreSQL server is up and running, you’ll probably want to connect to it from your application.
Here’s how to connect to PostgreSQL from popular programming languages and frameworks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">PHP</dt>
	<dd>
			<p>
				To connect from PHP, make sure that it supports PostgreSQL.
				The version included with macOS doesn&#39;t support PostgreSQL.
				We recommend <a href="https://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for an easy way to install a current version of PHP that works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use PDO (object oriented):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$db = new PDO(&#39;pgsql:host=localhost&#39;);
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
$statement-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[&#34;datname&#34;]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				Or the <tt>pg_connect()</tt> functions (procedural):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$conn = pg_connect(&#34;host=localhost&#34;);
$result = pg_query($conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {

      <p>Joseph Allen runs a major public health research project at Harvard University, probing how indoor air quality affects human health and cognition. He consults with companies on ventilation and air filtration, and during the pandemic he became a prominent voice on public health, writing dozens of op-eds criticizing early guidance from health authorities and debunking misconceptions about how the virus spreads. But none of it would have happened if he hadn’t washed out as an FBI recruit.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City homicide detective who opened his own investigative agency, Allen spent his teens and 20s helping with the family business. He did surveillance, undercover work, computer forensics, and skiptrace—tracking down people who left town to avoid alimony. Eventually he took over the agency, leading investigations and supervising eight agents.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the work and thought it was challenging,” Allen recalls. But part of him always wanted to be a scientist. He majored in environmental science at Boston College, and in his late 20s, still torn, he began to apply to graduate school even as he started the process to become an FBI agent. After 2 years of interviews and testing, the last step was a routine polygraph test. He failed the first round—the trick questions he was asked were so obvious that he could not take them seriously. So FBI flew in one of its toughest examiners from Iraq—a hulking, jackbooted guy who got right in Allen’s face, screaming that he knew he was lying. But Allen kept cool, and after a while, the interrogator stormed out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>“I thought he would come back in the room and say, ‘Congratulations,’ cause I’m thinking I’m crushing it,” Allen recalls. “But they failed me because they said I employed countermeasures.” FBI apparently didn’t want an agent who couldn’t be unnerved by a polygraph test. And that solved Allen’s career dilemma. “I guarantee I’m the only public health student ever to fail an FBI lie detector polygraph in the morning and start graduate school a few hours later,” Allen says. But his investigative instincts never left him.</p>

<p>A tall, athletic-looking man with a bald head and stylish stubble, Allen directs the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he studies the effects of toxic gases emitted from furniture, carpets, and paints; stale air; and high levels of carbon dioxide. Years of studies by Allen and others have shown poorly circulated air in buildings impairs our ability to think clearly and creatively. Considering that we spend more than 90% of our lifetimes indoors, those findings have implications for personal well-being—and for businesses concerned about their bottom line.</p>

<p>“Joe has always had a unique understanding of this range of domains—from how buildings work, to environmental exposure assessment, to making connections with health outcomes,” says Brent Stephens, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “There’s not a tremendous number of people in this world that have worked on that whole spectrum.”</p>

<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, the previously esoteric field of indoor air quality suddenly became the focus of widespread concern. Like many of his colleagues, Allen jumped into the fray, advising school systems, police departments, entertainment companies, the Boston Symphony, and a host of other entities on how to make their indoor air healthier, during the pandemic and afterward.</p>

<p>“COVID really changed the conversation,” says Matt Murray, vice president of leasing at Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded developer in the United States and one of Allen’s consulting clients. Before the pandemic, the company would have to explain to bored executives why they should pay attention to indoor air. “Now, the CEOs are all saying, ‘What filters do you use? How you process the air you bring into the workspace?’” Murray says. “And we’re ready for those conversations because we’ve been working with Joe.”</p>

<p><span>After he failed</span> his FBI exam, Allen became a different kind of sleuth. For his doctoral thesis at the Boston University School of Public Health, he investigated toxic flame-retardant chemicals released into the air by furniture, and found they were nearly ubiquitous. (The chemicals were later banned.) After graduation he got a job with a consulting firm, where he investigated problems such as toxic emissions from drywall and outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, which is caused by bacteria that grow in plumbing and become aerosolized by ventilation systems, showers, or even flushed toilets. Those investigations introduced him to “sick building syndrome,” a problem first identified in the 1970s in which the occupants experience fatigue, itchy eyes, headaches, and other symptoms. Exactly what causes these ailments isn’t clear, but exposure to contaminated air is a likely culprit. Allen became convinced that the building you work in can have more impact on your health than your doctor.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>In 2014, Allen accepted a position at Harvard, where he soon turned his attention to how the indoor environment can affect people’s cognitive abilities. Many of us have struggled to pay attention during a long staff meeting in a stuffy conference room. Research by Allen and others suggests that lassitude may not be due solely to boredom, but also to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-rich conference room air.</p>

<p>Ever since the energy shocks of the 1970s, buildings in the United States have been made as airtight and energy-efficient as possible. The result was a buildup of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. “Green building standards” introduced in the late ’90s focused on reducing toxic materials and making buildings healthier as well as more sustainable, but they didn’t prioritize indoor air quality and ultimately did little to improve it.</p>

<p>In a multiyear series of experiments, Allen and his team have investigated the consequences. In the first study, published in 2015, they had 24 white-collar volunteers spend six working days in environmentally controlled office spaces at Syracuse University’s Total Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. On various days the experimenters would alter ventilation rates and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs. Each afternoon the volunteers were tested on their ability to think analytically and react to a crisis. (One test, for example put the volunteer in the role of a small-town mayor trying to react to an emergency.) All tests were double-blind: Neither the volunteers nor the study personnel knew that day’s environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The results were dramatic. When volunteers worked in well-ventilated conditions (which lowered the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs), they scored 61% higher than when they worked in typical office building conditions. When they worked in the cleanest conditions, with even lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels and higher ventilation rates, their scores climbed 101%.</p>

<p>To find out whether the results held up in the real world, Allen and his team recruited 109 volunteers from 10 office buildings across the United States. Six had been renovated to create better heat and humidity control, improve ventilation, and lower the use of toxic materials. Four had not. Allen’s team gave each office worker a Fitbit-like bracelet to record heart rate, skin temperature, sleep patterns, and other physiological signs of well-being. Workers also completed a survey each day about how comfortable they felt and whether they experienced symptoms such as drowsiness or headaches. At the end of the week, they took the cognitive tests. Workers in the buildings with good ventilation and lower levels of indoor pollution scored 26.4% higher than those in the unimproved buildings. They also reported sleeping better and experiencing fewer “sick building” symptoms.</p>

  <figcaption><p>Many sources of indoor air pollution can affect human health and cognition. These include particles and gases emitted by furniture and building materials, as well as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exhaled by a building’s occupants. Choosing better materials and improving ventilation, filtration, and air processing can help make buildings healthier.</p>

      <p>“This is really important, interesting work,” says Elliott Gall, an indoor air scientist at Portland State University. “It’s a great example of the kind of interdisciplinary work [that explores] the complexity of indoor air and how it affects us.”</p>

<p>Over time, Allen came to see businesspeople as natural allies who could act on his public health findings faster than government officials. He teamed up with John Macomber, a Harvard Business School lecturer and former CEO of one of the largest construction companies in New England. Macomber was impressed with Allen’s research suggesting a tiny sacrifice in energy efficiency through improved ventilation could increase a business’s bottom line by as much as 10% by decreasing absenteeism and boosting worker productivity. “I realized we’ve been missing the boat,” Macomber says. “We’re chasing pennies on energy when there’s thousands of dollars in productivity issues.”</p>

<p>Allen and Macomber consulted with companies and spoke at corporate conferences, making the economic case for improving ventilation and filtration as well as adjusting lighting, temperature, and humidity. “The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated,” they wrote in a book they co-authored, <em>Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity</em>. “There are just a handful of things we need to do to make a building healthier.”</p>

<p>Allen’s group continued to investigate how the indoor environment affects our mental state. They found that airline pilots exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> levels common in cockpits did worse on Federal Aviation Administration–mandated emergency response tests than when they breathed better air. They showed that during a heat wave, students who lived in non–air-conditioned dorms had slower reaction times and poorer problem-solving skills than those with air conditioning. They showed that bringing plants and views of nature into the workplace can lower office workers’ heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological indicators of stress.</p>

<p>In 2019, Allen’s team embarked on an ambitious international project to examine the long-term impacts of indoor air quality by tracking the physical and cognitive health of more than 300 office workers in 43 buildings in six countries over the course of 1 year. They mailed each worker a wristband to monitor their physiology and a small sensor to continuously measure levels of fine particulates and CO<sub>2</sub> in their workspace. At predetermined times and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and particulates, the program pinged each worker’s smartphone with a quiz to test reaction time and cognitive function. The studies showed that in offices across the world, poor ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub>, and particulates (which carry VOCs) conspire to significantly impair cognitive function.</p>

<p><span>When the first reports</span> of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Allen realized his years researching air quality and disease transmission in indoor environments had new relevance. “Even though the virus was novel, there are elements in all this that feel quite familiar,” he says. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a radiological hazard, biological hazard, or chemical hazard. We know how to assess the risk and put in appropriate controls.”</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) latched onto the idea that the virus was spread by large, exhaled droplets that float for a short time and then settle on surfaces. But scientists specializing in aerosols knew airborne viruses are more likely to ride on tinier particles exhaled when people breathe, sneeze, cough, or talk. Smaller than 5 microns, these particles can travel across a room and linger in indoor air for hours.</p>

<p>Aerosol experts such as Lidia Morawska of Australia’s Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point; Donald Milton of the University of Maryland, College Park; and Linsey Marr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the focus on larger droplets had led to wrong-headed guidance about washing packages with bleach, staying 2 meters apart—even outdoors—and other forms of what some researchers called “hygiene theater.” They urged policies that emphasized indoor mask wearing and less draconian regulations for people outdoors, where the virus would quickly disperse.</p>

<p>Allen signed on to that fight, collaborating with aerosol experts and public health researchers on scientific papers and bringing their case to the public. “He’s a really good public communicator,” says Marr, who credits Allen with helping her work get the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>“One of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on,” Allen says. “Even by late January 2020 we knew that airborne transmission of aerosols was not only likely, but probable.” Waiting for proof made no sense. “This was a pandemic, an all-in moment, so why wouldn’t we have immediately deployed every strategy that could have helped?” Those strategies, Allen knew from his research, include bringing more outside air into chronically underventilated buildings and using higher efficiency filters in ventilation units.</p>

      <p>He started waking up at 4 a.m. to write opinion pieces. His first two, in the <em>Financial Times </em>and <em>The New York Times</em>, argued that buildings, if properly ventilated, could be formidable weapons in the fight against the virus. He and his team had measured air flow in schoolrooms under various conditions, and Allen explained that schools could easily be made safe by opening windows and buying the kind of high-efficiency particulate air purifiers sold at local home stores.</p>

<p>So much of his writing involved correcting misimpressions that he felt he was playing editorial whack-a-mole. No, he argued, you do not have to wipe your groceries with bleach. No, you do not have to avoid exercising outside. No, schools do not need to install costly air-purifying systems.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Morawska and Milton wrote an open letter to WHO—a full-throated appeal to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission. Allen was among 237 other scientists in 32 countries who signed on to the letter, which urged greater emphasis on indoor air quality. But WHO continued to downplay the importance of aerosol transmission. “I think some of the reluctance was that if [health authorities] say a disease is airborne, we’d have to provide N95 masks for every health worker and have negative pressure rooms in every hospital, which wasn’t possible,” Marr says.</p>

<p>Later that month, Allen and his Harvard colleague Parham Azimi published a study in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>that used computer modeling to reconstruct the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak on the <em>Diamond Princess </em>cruise ship. By mapping the ship’s ventilation system and the locations of people who came down with the disease, they showed that only aerosols, not larger droplets, could have traveled the necessary distances through the ducts. Similar findings emerged from studies by Marr, Morawska, and others.</p>

<p>Finally, in early May, after a series of persuasive papers in major journals, WHO and CDC acknowledged that the virus was transmitted primarily by fine aerosols. (Even then, the agencies issued no major announcements but simply changed the wording on their websites.) Since then, CDC has gone further, issuing recommendations for reopening schools that stress the importance of good ventilation in addition to vaccinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen and his colleagues at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program created a website with a comprehensive guide to maintaining proper ventilation in schools, homes, and businesses. The website advises building managers to bring in as much outside air as possible—a room air exchange rate of four to six times per hour, more than double the rate in a typical office or school building. In buildings that recirculate interior air, managers should upgrade to hospital-grade MERV 13 filters, which remove up to 90% of particles 2.5 microns or smaller, rather than the typical MERV 8, which can remove as little as 20%.</p>

<p>The new focus on indoor air quality could help hasten the end of the current pandemic and perhaps even help forestall the next one. It may bring broader changes as well. Businesspeople are recognizing the value of improving indoor air to create better working conditions and add value to their properties. “What we’re seeing with some parts of the market—notably the higher end, real estate investment trusts, owners of multiple office buildings or apartments—is they’re thinking really hard about competing” in the post pandemic market, Macomber says. “And one way to compete is to have healthier buildings.”</p>

<p>Allen predicts that the new availability of cheap personal air quality monitors will quicken that competition and heighten people’s awareness of the indoor environment. Previously, the only way to assess indoor air quality was to hire an expensive consultant. Now, with monitors available online for less than a couple of hundred dollars, any office worker or hotel guest can quickly monitor CO<sub>2</sub>; some devices even detect VOCs. If consumers post results on websites like Yelp, businesses would be forced to pay attention. (Indeed, some building owners already boast about air quality in advertisements.)</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a fundamental rebalancing in terms of how we think about indoor spaces,” Allen says. “I think that people won’t tolerate sick buildings, where you feel tired, your eyes itch, you have a headache, or you’re stuffed into a closetlike office with no windows.” It’s one lasting positive from the pandemic. “That era is over,” Allen says. “Rightly so, and good riddance.”</p>

      <title>I compromised 300 stores and a “Spanish consultancy”</title>
      <link>https://edbrsk.dev/content/real-cases/how-I-compromised-300-stores-and-a-spanish-consultancy</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p></p>
<h2 id="part-1.-how-i-compromised-300-stores">Part 1. How I compromised 300 stores:</h2>
<p>I was on an online store, you know, to compare prices about something I wanted to buy. I got bored. I opened the Wappalyzer: Apache 2.4.46, Amazon EC2, PHP. Okay!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It all started as a “let’s see if this site is vulnerable to something or not”. I’m not gonna post names, and I’ll try to avoid any hints. The report about the vulnerabilities and the misconfigurations is still ongoing, so some issues may not be fixed everywhere yet.</p>
<p>It was not a Wordpress or another kind of CMS, okay… I checked the robots.txt. I found a panel to log in… I tried default credentials like admin/admin, etc., but were not working. Reading the footer of the log-in panel, I found two things. The store is part of a chain with more than 300 stores, and the CMS/Platform (I don’t know how to call it) was made by the same company. A little bit of “Googling” to confirm, and I found that <strong>ALL OF THEM</strong> have the same “CMS”, the same log-in panel, just a few differences like CSS, languages, etc. What if all of them have common credentials? Looks promising! 😅</p>
<p>Let’s scan the ports of this server to have a little bit more of information.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 21  open ftp  vsftpd 2.2.2</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 22  open ssh  OpenSSH 7.4</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 80  open http Apache httpd 2.4.48 Amazon OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.1.33</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 443 open ssl  Apache httpd</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I exported the scan on a file to have an idea about the services running on the server.</p>
<p>I’m always trying the basic things first. I tried some reflected/persistent XSS, SQL Injection on the search bar, etc,. there are some params in the URL, so I thought that I could inject code there, but I wasn’t successful in the beginning. At that moment I thought: “Well… maybe the people that built this custom CMS are sanitizing the params, or using I don’t know, some framework that is doing that for them under the hood”. Not really. Have you ever read before about Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Attacks? The search bar has some filters to apply, so I tried some things on them, and BINGO! 😎</p>
<p><code>https://www.target.com/action?q=search_term&amp;VULNERABLE_PARAM=1; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code></p>
<p>The magic happens with the <code>; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code> you can google more about it. The important thing here, is that I was able to dump the database. I was expecting just a few tables, the ones related with the site, but to my surprise there is just one schema with the name of this chain I saw before on the log in panel. This schema contains more than three thousand tables, yep, more than 3000 tables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, I invest some time trying to figure out the tables. Some of them in English, others in Spanish, also temporary tables, theoretically, but the interesting one was: <code>Usuarios</code>. I downloaded the data from this table, and a list of potential admin users, emails, phones, some tokens for purposes that I didn’t understand at that time, etc. At least the passwords were hashed.</p>
<p>I was kind of sad at this point. Thinking: “Well… this is the end. I found an SQL Injection, a <strong>lot of data</strong>, but nothing else.” My girlfriend and my dog suggested that I get off the computer, so I went to sleep. 🌖</p>
<p>I was searching for an inspirational quote to put it here, but I just came up with this one:</p>
<p><code>Every sunrise is a chance to think if you are on the correct path.</code></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wasn’t in the correct path. I had to figure out something else. I woke up, and I created a dictionary with data from the “Usuarios” table. Actually, brute force wasn’t needed. I got it on the first attempt. WTF? Seriously? 🤯 I got access to the dashboard as a Super Admin in less than 1 minute. The password of this guy was the same as his username. Nice! 👏🏼</p>
<p>I can’t upload a picture of it but imagine the common Bootstrap template for dashboards. I got access to <strong>everything</strong>: Orders, Discounts, Products, Clients, News/Posts, Newsletters, etc., and I had the permissions to do everything I wanted.</p>
<p>Is that a common practice of this company? Yes, it is. I haven’t tried the 300 stores, but I logged in to some of them as a Super Admin and I was able to login into other web pages that are not part of the chain with the same credentials.</p>
<p>I was lucky. I mean, in the end, it could just have been an SQL Injection, but you know… “Humans are the weakest link in the Cybersecurity chain.”</p>
<p>Let’s grab a beer, this is not the end. 🍺</p>
<h2 id="part-2.-how-i-compromised-a-spanish-consultancy">Part 2. How I compromised a “Spanish consultancy”:</h2>
<p>I thought about writing an email to these people, let them know about the vulnerabilities in their code, and the bad practices they have, but I didn’t at this point. I felt like I was able to find more things regarding this company. I used to work in consultancy before, and usually, these companies are involved in more than one project. So, I opened the browser, and I started to do a bit of “OSINT” about this company.</p>
<p>Valuable information I found:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company is involved in projects where are receiving money from &#34;concursos públicos&#34;.</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>(Projects for their &#34;Comunidad autónoma&#34; for example.)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The CMS it&#39;s not just being used in the 300 stores.</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>It&#39;s also reused in other projects, and yes, the credentials I found are still valid.</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company was offering different (vulnerable) products some of them as a SAAS.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are more things, but I want to keep this post short if possible. At this point, I knew a few things about the company. I tried to find subdomains, and one of them potentially caught my attention.</p>
<p>The company uses <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket Chat</a> (similar to Slack) under a subdomain, and you don’t need any VPN/2FA/whatever to log in. Figure out the credentials! Yeah, you are right! 😉 Our credentials works for the chat as well, and our guy has the Admin role.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All right, I was in! 🍾🥂 We could say that I was inside the company. At this point I was able to read private conversations with the employees, find words on public channels/private conversations, take a look at what they are saying about their clients… whatever I want… in the end, I logged in as their boss, and he has the Admin role.</p>
<p>Okay… Well, things I tried (and worked):</p>

<p>If we take a look at the ports scan I wrote above, we have ports 21/22 opened, right? So, let’s try to find the credentials in private conversations. Yep, I got FTP and SSH credentials!</p>
<p>At this point I was able to upload/download/modify the code, actually, this is how I found the database host + credentials because as you may know it’s quite common to have the credentials in some config file if you are not using, idk, AWS Secrets Manager or something similar.</p>
<p>Users are writing their credit cards here. Do you understand the risk of all of this?</p>
<p>Anyway… I was able to get a reverse shell and take a look to the server as well.</p>

<p>Having admin credentials, it’s critical per se. I mean, I can read their conversations about everything. However, we don’t have the credentials of everyone, looks like some employees are not following the bad practices, so their password is not their username. No worries, a little bit more “googling” and we can fix that!</p>
<h4 id="cookie-hijacking">Cookie Hijacking</h4>
<p>Rocket Chat allows you to create custom scripts in JavaScript. I was an admin, so, I could do that! The idea it’s create a script that does a request somewhere to save the <code>rc_uid</code> and <code>rc_token</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you have to be “creative?”. Let’s gonna create a simple PHP script and deploy it somewhere:</p>

      <title>An Open Letter Against Apple&#39;s Privacy-Invasive Content Scanning Technology</title>
      <link>https://appleprivacyletter.com/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___appleprivacyletter_com_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="letter">
			<h2>Dear Apple,</h2>
			<p>
				On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" target="_blank">announced</a> new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of <em>“Expanded Protections for Children”</em>. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, <strong>Apple&#39;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple&#39;s proposed technology works by <strong>continuously monitoring all photos stored or shared on a user&#39;s iPhone, iPad or Mac</strong>, and notifying the authorities if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately after Apple&#39;s announcement, experts around the world sounded the alarm on how Apple&#39;s proposed measures could turn every iPhone into a device that is continuously scanning all photos and messages that pass through it in order to report any objectionable content to law enforcement, setting a precedent where our personal devices become a radical new tool for invasive surveillance, with little oversight to prevent eventual abuse and unreasonable expansion of the scope of surveillance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation has said</a> that <strong><em>“Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“It’s impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses […] That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://cdt.org/press/cdt-apples-changes-to-messaging-and-photo-services-threaten-users-security-and-privacy/" target="_blank">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> has said that it is <strong><em>“deeply concerned that Apple’s changes in fact create new risks to children and all users, and mark a significant departure from long-held privacy and security protocols”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Apple is replacing its industry-standard end-to-end encrypted messaging system with an infrastructure for surveillance and censorship, which will be vulnerable to abuse and scope-creep not only in the U.S., but around the world,” says Greg Nojeim, Co-Director of CDT’s Security &amp; Surveillance Project. “Apple should abandon these changes and restore its users’ faith in the security and integrity of their data on Apple devices and services.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Carmela Troncoso, a leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554795487518723" target="_blank">has said</a> that while <strong><em>“Apple&#39;s new detector for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is promoted under the umbrella of child protection and privacy, it is a firm step towards prevalent surveillance and control”</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Matthew D. Green, another leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green" target="_blank">has said</a> that <strong><em>“yesterday we were gradually headed towards a future where less and less of our information had to be under the control and review of anyone but ourselves. For the first time since the 1990s we were taking our privacy back. Today we’re on a different path”</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/" target="_blank">adding</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“The pressure is going to come from the UK, from the US, from India, from China. I&#39;m terrified about what that&#39;s going to look like. Why Apple would want to tell the world, ‘Hey, we&#39;ve got this tool’?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Sarah Jamie Lewis, Executive Director of the <a href="https://openprivacy.ca" target="_blank">Open Privacy Research Society</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1423403656733290496" target="_blank">has warned</a> that:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“If Apple are successful in introducing this, how long do you think it will be before the same is expected of other providers? Before walled-garden prohibit apps that don&#39;t do it? Before it is enshrined in law? How long do you think it will be before the database is expanded to include &#34;terrorist&#34; content&#34;? &#34;harmful-but-legal&#34; content&#34;? state-specific censorship?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Nadim Kobeissi, a researcher in Security &amp; Privacy issues, <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423388549529968645">warned</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				”Apple sells iPhones without FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, because local regulation prohibits encrypted phone calls. That&#39;s just one example of many where Apple&#39;s bent to local pressure. What happens when local regulations in Saudi Arabia mandate that messages be scanned not for child sexual abuse, but for homosexuality or for offenses against the monarchy?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">statement</a> on the issue supports the above concern with additional examples on how Apple&#39;s proposed technology could lead to global abuse:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Take the example of India, where recently passed rules include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of “misinformation” in 24 hours may apply to messaging services. And many other countries—often those with authoritarian governments—have passed similar laws. Apple’s changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the Electronic Frontier Foundation insists that it&#39;s already seen this mission creep in action: <strong><em>“one of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of “terrorist” content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite calls from civil society.”</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Fundamental design flaws in Apple&#39;s proposed approach have also been pointed out by experts, who have <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423387147172724741" target="_blank">claimed</a> that <strong><em>“Apple can trivially use different media fingerprinting datasets for each user. For one user it could be child abuse, for another it could be a much broader category”</em></strong>, thereby enabling selective content tracking for targeted users.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type of technology that Apple is proposing for its child protection measures depends on an expandable infrastructure that can&#39;t be monitored or technically limited. Experts have <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554811086188548" target="_blank">repeatedly warned</a> that the problem isn&#39;t just privacy, but also the lack of accountability, technical barriers to expansion, and lack of analysis or even acknowledgement of the potential for errors and false positives.
 			</p>
			 <p>
				 Kendra Albert, a lawyer at the Harvard Law School&#39;s Cyberlaw Clinic, <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114" target="_blank">has warned</a> that <strong><em>“these &#34;child protection&#34; features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse”</em></strong>, adding:
			 </p>
			 <blockquote>
				“I just know (calling it now) that these machine learning algorithms are going to flag transition photos. Good luck texting your friends a picture of you if you have &#34;female presenting nipples.&#34;”
			 </blockquote>
			 <h3>Our Request</h3>
			 <p>
				 We, the undersigned, ask that:
			 </p>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Apple Inc.&#39;s&#39; deployment of its proposed content monitoring technology is halted immediately.</li>
				 <li>Apple Inc. issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to end-to-end encryption and to user privacy.</li>
			 </ol>
			 <p>
				 Apple&#39;s current path threatens to undermine decades of work by technologists, academics and policy advocates towards strong privacy-preserving measures being the norm across a majority of consumer electronic devices and use cases. We ask that Apple reconsider its technology rollout, lest it undo that important work.

      <title>The Cold War Fashion Showdown</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The Russians may have been winning the space race in the 1950s, but they couldn’t hold a candle to the sophistication of Western dress.</p><figure><figcaption>In the summer of 1959, the Cold War moved from the fields of science and technology to that of cultural exchange. </figcaption></figure><p>By the late 1950s, having <a href="https://www.space.com/17563-sputnik.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fired the first shot</a> in the space war, Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev extended the competition with the West to everyday culture and lifestyle. Thus, in the summer of 1959 the Cold War moved to the ﬁeld of cultural exchange. The Soviets organized an exhibition of their scientiﬁc, technological, and cultural achievements in New York, and the Americans followed with their own national exhibition in Moscow. Both Russians and Americans tried to show off their best clothes on each occasion. The official repositioning of the phenomenon of fashion in socialism therefore took place within the context of a ﬁght for cultural supremacy.</p><p>American vice president Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat, traveled to Moscow to open the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Fifty_Years_Ago_American_Exhibition_Stunned_Soviets_in_Cold_War/1783913.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American National Exhibition</a>. Before their visit, Pat Nixon carefully chose a new wardrobe, as reported in Newsweek:</p><blockquote><p>One suit of natural raw silk, a brown silk taffeta cocktail dress, a silk and cotton ﬂowered print dress with jacket and two other dresses. Most of her clothes were bought at Henry Bendel’s in New York where Pat spent an hour—and several hundred dollars. “They are costumes,” she explained. “Mostly full-skirted dresses with matching accessories to make a ‘picture.’ They are not high fashion and they’re the sort of thing I like, and which I think looks best on me.”</p></blockquote><p>At the opening of the exhibition, in the company of her husband and the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov, Pat Nixon glowed in her natural raw silk suit and smart hat. She looked just as she was supposed to: like a sophisticated and well-heeled American housewife. The message was clear: the Russians might be ahead in space research and education, but they cannot match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady going about her everyday life.</p><p>Pat Nixon’s carefully chosen wardrobe revealed a lifestyle with which the Russians could not compete. This lifestyle was even recited by IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAMAC</a>, the first commercial computer, present at the exhibition, which provided four thousand answers about different aspects of life in America. One of them offered information in perfect Russian about the wardrobe of an average American woman. She owned: <em>“Winter coat, spring coat, raincoat, ﬁve house dresses, four afternoon ‘dressy’ dresses, three suits, three skirts, six blouses, two petticoats, ﬁve nightgowns, eight panties, ﬁve brassières, two corsets, two robes, six pairs of nylon stockings, two pairs of sports socks, three pairs of dress gloves, three pairs of play shorts, one pair of slacks, one play suit, and accessories.”</em></p><p>During the exhibition, American fashion was presented at four thirty-ﬁve-minute-long fashion shows that took place each day, each of them attended by three thousand to ﬁve thousand Russians. The Soviet authorities had opposed many of the American proposals for the exhibition, but eventually the Russian audiences got a chance to enjoy the American fashion shows, which consisted of youthful clothes, leisure wear, daily ensembles, and formal long evening dresses.</p><p>Attempting to bring the Russians “a living slice of America,” the outﬁts were presented by professional models as well as children, teenagers, grandparents, and whole families. Newsweek described the fashion show as boring, but acknowledged the political meaning behind the clothes: “The dresses were all right, though a bit on the dull side,” they reported. “The whole idea behind it was to show the people of the Soviet Union how the average American woman dresses at work and at play — not the glamorous girl on Park Avenue, but the young matron on Main Street.” The choice of everyday mass-produced American clothes was very powerful propaganda. If sophisticated outﬁts from New York fashion salons had been shown, they could easily have been attacked as elitist clothes meant for the exploiting class. But the Americans knew only too well that the Russians could not compete in the ﬁeld of decent mass-produced clothing.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” reported the New York Times.</p></blockquote></figure><p>While fashion contributed to the huge propaganda effect that the American National Exhibition had in Moscow, the American media commented on the shortcomings in the culture of everyday Soviet life at the Russian exchange exhibition that had taken place only two months earlier in the New York Coliseum. “The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/30/80589100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> the New York Times, “with clothes and furs that are rarely seen on Moscow streets.” The fashion show that was included in the exhibition drew ironic comments from Western journalists. Five female models and one male model displayed designs by Soviet fashion designers from the leading Moscow department store GUM and the <em>Dom modelei, </em>or House of Prototypes, an institution created by Stalin to produce prototypes for socialist fashion. Time magazine reported that “the textiles, mostly thick, heavy-textured woolen suits, are more impressive for their usefulness against the Russian winter than for their styles, which are clumsy attempts to copy western designs.”</p><p>Though the American media declared GUM’s outﬁts “clumsy copies,” they were actually the most prestigious representations of Soviet-style elegance. In 1956, GUM’s general director, V. G. Kamenov, wrote a booklet describing in detail the services that the Soviet ﬂagship department store offered. Fashion ateliers for custom-made clothes and special shops selling natural silk, artistically hand-painted silk, women’s hats, fur coats, and perfumes were supposed to present an idea of abundance and sophistication. In the illustrations accompanying the text, attentive sales personnel were shown offering customers these traditionally luxurious goods. One section of the booklet dealt with new sales techniques, while another praised the fashion salons within the store, which offered individual service in sumptuous surroundings.</p><p>The store’s interior, ﬁlled with dark carved wooden furniture, crystal chandeliers, and heavy velvet curtains, was similar to the Stalinist concept of palaces of consumption of the 1930s. The store continued an outdated, grandiose aesthetics that promoted the mythical Stalinist concept of luxury. But this Stalinist gloriﬁcation of reality, which tried to remove all conﬂicting and erratic elements from everyday life, could not compete with ordinary life in the West. Thus, with the opening of the Soviet Union toward the West, the disjunction between the deprivation of everyday life and its ideal representation became blatantly obvious.</p><div><figure><figcaption>The fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Pictured in this 1959 cover of Life magazine: Pat Nixon with her Soviet counterparts: (from left) Mrs. Mikoian, Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Khrushcheva, and Mrs. Kozlova.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the late 1950s, in comparison with the efficiency of the large American department stores and the diversity and quality of the mass-produced goods that they offered, GUM had become outdated and provincial, as direct contacts with the West painfully revealed. The cover of Life magazine from August 1959 showed that the fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Flanked by Mrs. Mikoian (on her left), Nina Khrushcheva (right), and Mrs. Kozlova (far right), Pat Nixon appeared as a smartly dressed upper-class American housewife. The Life magazine cover was a visual testament to the Soviet diplomats’ wives’ inability to match the sophisticated, worldly style of Pat Nixon in her silk, ﬂower-printed dress, a string of pearls, and carefully applied makeup, as well as her svelte ﬁgure. Accompanying their husbands, the ladies attended a dinner table conference at Khrushchev’s <em>dacha</em>, or country house.</p><p>There were signiﬁcant visual differences among the three Soviet politicians’ wives, which pointed to their different levels of sartorial awareness. Nina Khrushcheva was clad in the simplest dress, which buttoned at the front. Called <em>khalat</em>, this style had become a domestic uniform of Soviet women. Women wore <em>khalat</em> at home, whether going about their domestic work, cooking, resting, or entertaining. Mrs. Mikoian was dressed in a sartorially more demanding outﬁt: a suit, with a cut that discreetly shaped the body. Her suit was modest, but its proletarian asceticism was softened with a little hat. That fashion detail showed a certain investment in her look, transforming her simple suit into an outdoor outﬁt.</p><p>The formal outﬁt worn by the wife of the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov showed a full awareness of the importance of the occasion. Mrs. Kozlova’s evening gown, embellished with embroidery around the neckline, as well as her embroidered muslin stole, her white evening handbag, her white gloves, her hairstyle and makeup showed a new attitude toward fashionable dress. But Mrs. Kozlova could not yet match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady of the same social standing. The ideologically informed rejection of fashion’s history was imprinted on Mrs. Kozlova’s dress even more so than on Mrs. Mikoian’s simple suit or Nina Khrushcheva’s symbolically burdened housedress.</p><p>Mrs. Kozlova’s appearance not only acknowledged contemporary formal Western dress, but it broke an important socialist dress code. The most important members of the political bureaucracy or nomenklatura had always dressed modestly in public, a practice that had started with the Bolsheviks. Stalin and his political circle had also stuck to the proletarian ideal of modesty in their public looks, although their private lives had been loaded with all the symbols of traditional luxury, from fur coats to house help, antique furniture, and ﬁne food. The Old Bolshevik wives Nina Khrushcheva and Mrs. Mikoian respected the longstanding nomenklatura dress code. Recognizing that times were changing, Mrs. Kozlova, however, dared to transgress it.</p><hr/><p><em>Djurdja Bartlett is Reader in Histories and Cultures of Fashion at the London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London, and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FashionEast-Spectre-Haunted-Socialism-Press/dp/0262026503" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FashionEast: The Spectre that Haunted Socialism</a>.</em>“</p></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <div>
      <p>Today, Acting Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine sent the following letter to Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook’s misleading claims regarding the company’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">consent decree with the FTC</a>:</p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: </span></p>

<p><span>I write concerning Facebook’s recent insinuation that its actions against an academic research project conducted by NYU’s Ad Observatory were required by the company’s consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. As the company has since acknowledged, this is inaccurate. The FTC is committed to protecting the privacy of <em>people</em>, and efforts to shield targeted advertising practices from scrutiny run counter to that mission.</span></p>

<p><span>While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter. Only last week, Facebook’s General Counsel, Jennifer Newstead, committed the company to “timely, transparent communication to BCP staff about significant developments.” Yet the FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.</span></p>

<p><span>Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest. Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising. While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy – much less the FTC consent order – as a pretext to advance other aims. </span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>

<p><em><span>/s/ Samuel Levine </span></em></p>

<p><span>Acting Director</span></p>

<p>I am <s>broke</s> “non-liquid” right now. Normally, that sentence doesn’t have geopolitical ramifications on the creation of hybrid private-public surveillance state. But in my case it does.</p>



<p>It started rather innocuously. Someone couldn’t send me money. No matter what they did. They couldn’t transfer any money. Curious. We started experimenting with different friends, companies, and acquaintances. None of them could send me money. <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> wouldn’t provide any explanation. My business had been a paying customer for more than ~4+ years. And now, I was locked out. Okay. They’re hardly the only fish in the sea.</p>



<p>Except it happened again. This time with our bank, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>†. Okay, that’s strange. They asked for more details. We sent them details. Scans of my documentation. They’d revert back a few days later for more details. And we’d send it to them again. On and on we went chasing each other around the maypole. A few weeks passed, and Mercury’s team finally cut to the chase, they asked if I was affiliated with Entity X. We said no. But it didn’t matter. They froze me out anyway.</p>



<p>In some ways, we’re lucky that they flagged the transfer, because they gave us the first clue of what was going on. A friend ended up having the insight to search for Entity X (thanks Nick!) and found that <em>they’d been sanctioned</em>. Okay. What did this have to do with me?</p>



<p>On further investigation, we found that I shared my legal name with someone working with Entity X. Great. It’s a common name, like Robert Brown or Mary Johnson. Shouldn’t it be easy to prove that I’m not person X? A little Googling later, I found that the United States Department of the Treasury has an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and they have an email address for “reconsideration” if you’ve been mistakenly placed on the sanctions list. As I’m clearly not the person they were looking to sanction, I decided that the most logical course of action would be write to them, and get their assent that I am indeed not the human that they’re looking for.</p>



<p>We wrote something up (once again, thanks Nick). And we sent it in.</p>



<p>The OFAC replied, to their credit, quite promptly with a link for false positives, and they told me to send this to the bank. Okay. Done. Except, it didn’t matter. Mercury blocked me anyway. The saga finished with me getting nada.</p>



<p>I wrote back to the OFAC requesting them to write something, anything on an official looking letterhead stating the simple fact that I, Person X born on such and such date with an ID number of Z, am not the person who has been sanctioned. I offered to provide them with additional details if there was any hesitancy on their part.</p>



<p>They haven’t replied. And I still can’t get any cash.</p>



<p>What’s amazing about this saga is that I have a statistically common legal name. There are thousands of people running around with this name. And effectively, they’ve <em>all</em> been barred from the global financial system.</p>



<p>To their credit, the OFAC publishes additional details for each person to prevent this exact scenario from occurring. However, these details seem to vary across individuals and countries. It doesn’t seem to be a neat dataset to model. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists" target="_blank">the lists are available online in .PDF and .TXT files,</a> and it’s a mess. Also, there isn’t one list, but rather multiple lists, with different details. As far as I can tell, there is no <em>official</em> API. There is no efficient way for programmers designing, say a “[bank] built for startups” to comply with the Treasury. Consequently, someone decided, in a meeting room somewhere, to punt the problem.</p>



<p>If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just run a simple match against the name – the one element of the dataset guaranteed to be there – and then punt it to our underpaid and understaffed KYC department to deal with? And the KYC department punted it to legal. And legal took one look and went, “hrm, what’s our downside risk if we approve this? Do we know this person is indeed the one being sanctioned? Oh, I see. Well let’s just block them. There’s not much they can do about it.”</p>



<p>And so, I am currently <s>broke</s> non-liquid. Kafka would have been proud.</p>



<p><em>(for connoisseurs of dark humor, I find it particularly hilarious that more likely than not the person they’re targeting will never be affected by this. This person, with whom I have the misfortune of sharing a legal name, doesn’t seem to perform many international transactions. She lives in a cash-first developing country, where the sanctions have no reach. She’s but a lowly piece in a very big game)</em></p>



<hr/>



<p>In other news, Apple has decided to scan images on your phone. For child porn, of course. There aren’t enough people (nor PR capital) to look through all of your photos. So, they’ve done the efficient thing instead. They’re simply going to match all of your photos, on your phone, against a hash of child porn images. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Other, more eloquent commentators,</a> have pointed out the danger this poses. Apple often bends over for authoritarian regimes like China, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/technology/apple-hong-kong-app.html">remove apps that help pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong avoid police violence</a>. Or, that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned">the company doesn’t allow adults to view adult content on the devices that they own</a>. Or, in more conservative countries, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avng9/apple-is-letting-over-150-countries-censor-lgbtq-content-in-the-app-store">removing any apps that mention the inconvenient existence of LGBTQ+ people</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">Wikipedia has an exhaustive list.</a></p>



<p>However, it is not my purpose to repeat what these commentators have already said. Nor to write a polemic for its own sake. My goal is to use my experience to peer into the future. To predict, through inevitability, the chain of events for poor souls in days yet to pass.</p>



<p>Just like the programmers who chose to match names against the sanctions list, while the KYC and legal departments handle the rest, Apple is matching all of the private photos on your phone against a list. This list is generated using something called a hash function. It turns an image into a number that a computer can then use to make the comparison. The process looks a bit like this, </p>







<p>Please note this is an example from a lovely blog that goes through this process. Apple’s process is different, but inherently similar.</p>



<p>In most cases, when we’re dealing with hashes in computer science, we’re looking for exact matches. But this case is different. Criminals aren’t stupid. They’re often not clever, but not all of them are stupid. What if they add a filter? Or, change the image somehow? Maybe add in a blur? What then?</p>



<p>Well, clearly, they can’t make every variation possible of every image that the police are looking for. If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just look for <em>similarity</em> instead and then punt it to law enforcement to deal with? To put it another way, the question Apple is asking isn’t, “is this image exactly like this photo from the child porn database?” No, the question Apple is asking is, “is this image similar to this photo from the child porn database?” Where the “similar” question is answered by a very clever, but very dumb algorithm.</p>



<p>In my case, when the programmers punted to the KYC department and legal, a bunch of transactions were cancelled. In this case, the police will raid your house and arrest you for “child porn.”</p>



<p>The image they will raid you for wouldn’t even necessarily have to be an adult one. Computers are strange. They are very literal beings. They do <em>exactly</em> what they are told, which is both their greatest asset and weakness. For example, this neural network thinks that this cat is guacamole,</p>







<p>Apple’s algorithm is <em>very different</em>, but it is susceptible to the same problems. In this case, noise was added into the image to make the neural network classify the cat as guacamole. In your case, it could be just happenstance. Random noise due to lighting conditions that takes an innocent photo (or, more likely, an intimate photo of you or your partner) and makes the algorithm assume that it is <em>similar</em> to a restricted photo.</p>



<p>Just like me, one day you’ll wake up and notice that something weird might be going on. Maybe it’s a car parked outside your street. Maybe it’s a feeling like people are following you. You won’t be that alarmed at first. You’ll dismiss it. But, eventually, it will come crashing in. Your door will be knocked open by SWAT. And you will find yourself facing armored people in guns to your confusion. They’ll scream for you to raise your hands and put them behind your head. They’ll say, “ma’am we have a warrant for your arrest.” And confused, you’ll be walked out to a waiting squad car.</p>



<p>Your local newspaper will write, “[You] has been arrested for possessing child pornography.” But you won’t read the headline. You’ll be in an interrogation room. Waiting for them to come in. Maybe the officer is letting you sweat it out. Maybe not. But eventually they’ll come in and they’ll start interrogating you. “Ma’am do you consume pornography that has minors in it?”</p>



<p>And you’ll deny it. They’ll put your phone in front of you. It’ll be in one of those bags. You’ll unlock it for them. And you’ll know that they’re going to go through everything. Including that embarrassing pic you took for K.</p>



<p>They won’t find anything. So they’ll return to question you. Maybe you’ve deleted the photos, who knows? Let’s pass it on to forensics and see what they come up with.</p>



<p>Eventually, you’ll end up being detained in jail. Your bail will be set high. You’ll have to plead and explain to everyone around you that you don’t know what’s happening. You don’t know why this happened. And those near you might believe you, but there will be this doubt that crosses through their mind. Just for a second. They’ll have this doubt, and that doubt will always be there for the rest of their life.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough to have money, you’ll get a lawyer. They’ll work on getting you out. Eventually, the forensics will return nothing. Your lawyer will succeed in getting you to walk free. And you’ll walk back to your home, with stares from your neighbors.</p>



<p>In a few months, it’ll come out that no, Apple’s algorithm screwed up here. Apple will blame law enforcement. Law enforcement will blame Apple. It doesn’t matter. That newspaper will put up a small story on their site about how you’re really innocent. It won’t get many clicks. And the one about you getting arrested for possessing child porn will stay up forever. With a note added to it, if you’re lucky.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll get your life back. Maybe not. But you’ll spend the rest of your life under this cloud, because some programmer somewhere wrote this code. And everyone else assumed that it just works.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_bhphotovideo_com_explora_photography_hands-on-review_classic-cameras-my-dads-argus-c3/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For as long as I can remember, the heavy chunk of black Bakelite and chrome nicknamed “The Brick,” was a staple on a shelf in my parents’ living room. Officially known as the Argus C3, this solid pointy-edged rangefinder is said to be one of the most popular cameras in history, selling about 2 million units during its extraordinary 27-year production run, from 1939 to 1966.</p>
<p>While this camera belonged to my father, I have little memory of him using it, and even less of a sense for when and how he acquired it, or which images were made with the Argus when sifting through many decades of disorganized family snapshots squirreled away in cardboard boxes at home.</p>
<p>By the time I was in grade school, my father had largely abandoned the dials and knobs of this stately machine for the automatic exposure controls of a Kodak Brownie Auto 27. And while it’s easy to distinguish the square-format prints that Kodak generated from the mountain of other memories that make up our family picture collection, determining which of the earlier pictures were made with the Argus is indeed a mystery.</p>
<h3>The American Leica</h3>
<p>The company behind the Argus C3 was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Charles A. Verschoor, in 1931. Initially a radio manufacturer, an early product, the Kadette, was the first mass-produced AC/DC radio, using tubes instead of a large transformer. Although successful, radio sales were highly seasonal in the days before air conditioning, dropping off in summer months as people abandoned indoor entertainment for outdoor pursuits. To keep his factory and salesmen working all year, Verschoor searched for a product that could be cheaply manufactured and sold during the warmer half of the year.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/01-argus_c3_dsc4576_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>My father’s Argus C3, affectionately known as “the Brick.”</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>He was impressed by the early 35mm Leica cameras he saw during a business trip to Germany, and came up with a plan to adopt the same Bakelite molding technology used for radio casings, to make an affordable camera that would be similar to the Leica. From its debut in early 1936, Verschoor’s initial model A camera was a huge success, prompting him to name his new product line Argus, from the Greek mythological god of 1,000 eyes.</p>
<p>Designed and patented by Gustave Fassin, in 1938, the first Argus C model cameras were uncoupled rangefinders, which required the user to manually rotate the lens barrel to match the rangefinder reading. An upgraded model, the Argus C2, provided a coupled rangefinder, and in 1939 the Argus C3 added built-in flash synchronization via an accessory flash gun.</p>
<h3>Determining Provenance</h3>
<p>Turning back to my treasure trove of photos, I found some handwritten notes on the back of certain dog-eared prints indicating that my father had a camera in his possession during World War II. Could he have purchased the Argus C3 shortly after its release, before shipping out to basic training as a 20-year-old, and then on to the Canal Zone, and Europe? Whatever camera he had, it was certainly a model with a bulb setting—which the Argus C3 possessed—based on all the forerunners to selfie culture I found among his prints, along with a note scribbled on the back of a picture of him reclining in his bunk, describing his shooting process.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Four images of my father at Albrook Field, Canal Zone, made with a camera he owned during World War II. While he may have had help with the first three portraits, he wrote that he used the bulb setting on the back of the last print. It took me a lot of sleuthing to discover what camera he used for these pictures. Read through to the end to find out.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The extreme popularity of the Argus C3 has made it a cult classic, even though the company ceased production of this model in 1966. Turning to the Internet, I soon found a website that allows Argus owners to estimate a camera’s manufacturing date based on the camera’s serial number. If that data is accurate, my father’s camera was likely made in 1951, an ownership date that seems more plausible, as my father would have then been 32 years old, and in the process of building our house. Indeed, I have a vivid memory of a collection of spiral-bound albums showing every step of the construction process. Although these albums have since been disassembled, a large pile of surviving prints offers evidence that he was playing with a new toy while climbing scaffolding and driving nails.</p>
<p>According to some accounts, the public was captivated by the camera’s scientific appearance, with all its shiny metal dials and knobs on the front, along the top, and on the bottom. As a former airplane mechanic, and a newly minted electrician, and having the budding reputation as “mister fix-it,” it’s not hard to imagine my dad being drawn to what at the time was a powerful mix of deluxe features and affordable cost.</p>
<h3>Operating the Camera</h3>
<p>While the C3’s brick-like body has little in common with modern ergonomics, there is something satisfying about the weight of this camera in the hands. Looking down at the jet-black top surface, metal dials at left and right control the shutter release and film winding, while a rudimentary frame counter sits squarely on top, backed by a small hexagonal film catch. The shutter button has two settings—B for bulb and I for Instantaneous—marked on its chrome skirt, and the top of the button is threaded for the addition of a cable release.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the shutter release, the metal teeth of the rangefinder gear protrude from the top along the camera’s front edge, allowing the user to turn the rangefinder dial with their shutter finger, which engages the idler gear to focus the lens.</p>

</div><figcaption>Six images of my parents’ home in various stages of construction. The year was 1952-53, and I’m certain he was using the Argus C3. Since the negatives have long since vanished, these images were scanned from 2x3&#34; prints.</figcaption></figure><p>To the right of the rangefinder dial, two rectangular windows are home to separate finders: the viewfinder, which is used to compose a picture, and the rangefinder, which is used to focus with the aid of a split image. As you turn the rangefinder dial the two halves of the image move into or out of register, with the bottom half of the finder window tinted yellow as a visual aid. When the top and bottom halves line up at your desired focal point, your subject will be in focus. Alternatively, you can zone focus by turning the lens itself and estimating the subject-to-lens distance from the rangefinder dial.</p>
<p>A shutter speed dial in the upper right front corner controls the length of time the shutter will be open to light, with different versions of the camera offering a range of five, seven, or ten different speeds between 1/10 to 1/300 second.</p>
<p>Tying all these elements together is the camera lens, which is interchangeable due to the placement of the three-leaf shutter inside the camera body itself, not between the lens elements. A screw mount lens plate above the shutter mechanism accepts three different lenses, the default being a 50mm f/3.5 anastigmat triplet lens, the Argus Coated Cintar. My father also owned the 100mm f/4.5 Tele-Sandmar, made by Enna Werk, in Germany, while a C3 wide-angle lens also offered a 35mm f/4.5 focal length, ideal for group shots and working in tight spaces.</p>
<h3>Calibrating the Lens for Proper Rangefinder Focusing</h3>
<p>Since the lens is coupled to the rangefinder dial, to ensure proper focus it’s essential to carefully follow outlined steps when removing or replacing different lenses. When running my first roll of film through the camera, I overlooked these instructions, and the film ended up completely blurred. The text below is taken from the Argus C3 instruction manual, which proved to be all I needed for acceptable image sharpness. Yet, if that doesn’t work, more advanced instructions about correcting the rangefinder settings by removing a small circular dial on top of the camera can be found online.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/12-argus_c3_dsc4580_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Top view of the Argus C3. The small metal disk midway between the counter dial and film advance is the Rangefinder cover, which can be removed to fine tune both horizontal and vertical focus adjustments.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><em>To remove lens: Set the Rangefinder dial to the 3-foot mark, then unscrew the Idler Gear cap and lift out the gear, before unscrewing the lens by turning to the left.</em></p>
<p><em>To replace lens: Screw it back into the camera by turning to the right, past the resistance point until it is seated firmly. Then turn the lens back towards the left until a wide range of gear teeth are opposite the Idler Gear shaft. </em></p>
<p><em>Drop the Idler Gear into place on its metal post, and then turn the lens back to the right as far as it will go. This will position the lens at the infinity mark. Remove the Idler Gear, being careful not to disturb the lens position. Set the rangefinder dial exactly to infinity by turning it to the right and replace the Idler Gear without disturbing the positions of the lens or the Rangefinder dial.</em></p>
<p><em>Set the Rangefinder dial at the 3-foot mark, and screw on the Idler Gear cap. The camera is now ready for pictures!</em></p>
<h3>Running Film</h3>
<p>My father’s camera offers a purely analog shooting experience, with neither a battery or light meter to rein you in (although a later version, the Argus C3 Matchmatic, did boast an exposure meter on top). While it is feasible to use the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/sunny-16-rule">Sunny 16 Rule</a> as an exposure guide, I opted to use the meter in my miniscule Sony RX100 V as a digital chimp sheet of sorts, to speed the shooting process.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/13-argus_c3_dsc4575_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Interior view of the Argus C3, showing the camera’s three-blade shutter and film advance mechanisms. The two circular windows along the top are for the viewfinder (<em>left</em>) and rangefinder (<em>right</em>).</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Film is easily loaded into the camera by depressing the side latch and swinging open the back door, securing the film canister against the prong of the rewind knob, and threading the end of the film through a slot in the take up spindle at the other end. This method of loading film was much easier than Leica’s removable bottom panel design, which no doubt contributed to the Argus’s popularity during that era, in addition to its lower cost.</p>
<p>On top of the camera, the film advance knob is clearly marked with an arrow and the word wind, but to initiate a photo one must first activate the shutter cocking lever on the front. The rudimentary nature of using separate functions for cocking the shutter and advancing the film, combined with the complexity of rangefinder focusing, and the guesswork of proper exposure calculations, makes for a plodding, multi-step process, which can be a haven for error.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>The graphic lines and dimensionality of this steel globe was perfect for testing the C3’s focus and depth of field. What I didn’t factor in was a double exposure that resulted from a lapse of attention as I moved too quickly between shots. Despite the chaotic mash-up of lines and reflections in that image, I rather like it.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>One of the easiest and most prevalent mistakes to make occurs when the user exposes a picture but forgets to advance the film before cocking the shutter and shooting a second frame, thereby double-exposing. When not caused by a moment of forgetfulness, double exposure has great potential for creative expression, and arguments can even be made for the validity of double exposures caused by chance. However, when shooting with this camera, it’s advisable to adopt the concentration and presence of mind generally associated with large format analog photography, for best results.</p>
<p>Therefore, immediately after tripping the shutter, direct your attention to the black numbered film counter, and more specifically to the hexagonal metal tab—otherwise known as the film catch—at the back of the counter. To advance the film, begin winding the advance knob while pressing the film catch, and release the catch after a quarter turn. Then continue winding until the point of resistance, which means that you’ve arrived at the next frame. Repeat the process as you watch the film counter advance from one hash mark to the next. Once you encounter continuous resistance when trying to advance the film you’ve arrived at the end of the roll.</p>
<p>To rewind, simply turn the knurled winding knob at the bottom of the camera in the direction of the arrow using slow gentle pressure. In my experience, film sprockets are prone to tearing during the rewinding process, so it may be advisable to have a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=film%20changing%20bag&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=">film changing bag</a> handy in case you need to extract the film by opening the camera before it’s completely back in its case.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts on Use</h3>
<p>Considering the vagaries of framing pictures through the C3’s tiny, well-worn viewfinder, and ascertaining sharpness through a rangefinder that sometimes seems to function more like a Kaleidoscope, I was pleasantly surprised with some of my pictures. To be clear, this would not be an enjoyable tool for any photographer seeking precision or ease of use, yet as I began to settle into the process, I began to have fun exploring the camera’s limits, using a roll of <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/24624-REG/Ilford_1748192_Delta_400_Professional_135_36_Black.html">Ilford Delta 400 black-and-white film</a>.</p>

It was a bright sunny day, but the trees cast dappled sunlight, allowing me to open my 50mm f/3.5 Argus Coated Cintar lens to a wide aperture. After toying with the rangefinder focus in an overview shot, I decided to test its 3-foot minimum focal length in a close-up. At that distance, it’s much easier to adjust focus by moving the camera itself until the two halves of the rangefinder match up in the desired spot, rather than turning the rangefinder gear.</p>
<p>Once I had explored photo options in the park for a while, I made my way to Fifth Avenue and began photographing some of the stately monuments on my way to Rockefeller Center. Discovering the Atlas statue adorned with fresh flowers, I studied the monument from all sides to look for interesting angles. The midafternoon sun was beating down from the southwest, creating a strong backlight effect that I knew would be a great test for lens flare. Although the glare made it barely possible to focus or frame the shot below at right, the lens captured a much better picture than I had anticipated, with just a thin veil of flare along the bottom part of the image.</p>
<div><figure><div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/19-jill_argus_c3015.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/20-jill_argus_c3017.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div></div><figcaption>The C3’s rangefinder focus held true.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The images I shot were hand-developed using <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/213174-REG/Ilford_1960457_ID_11_Film_Developer.html">Ilford ID 11</a> at a dilution of 1:3 for 18 minutes. All the pictures in this story (prints and negatives) were scanned on an <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/647187-REG/Epson_B11B198011_Perfection_V600_Photo_Scanner.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">Epson Perfection V600 Photo Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>And, about the camera my father used during World War II. After much searching, I discovered an old picture album full of prints he had made during this period. While flipping through the pages, I happened upon a folded piece of white paper, which I opened to find an official note from his Commanding Officer, dated August 7, 1941, authorizing him to own a camera, which at that time was an Argus Model A, serial # 199578. Sadly, I have no idea where that camera is today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section role="main"><section><section><div id="post__wrapper-90660570"><div><div><div data-id="90660570" data-slug="the-smart-home-is-flailing-as-a-concept-because-it-sucks"><div><div><article><p>A couple of weeks ago, the tech industry group Consumer Technology Association (CTA) released a predictably cheery report on the state of consumer technology. It forecasted record-breaking revenues of $487 billion this year, with laptops, wireless earbuds, personal fitness devices, and 5G phones singled out for especially strong growth.</p><div><p>Yet tucked into that upbeat forecast was a spot of dreariness: Smart home devices, once <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/why-2017-will-finally-be-the-year-of-the-smart-home-consumers-figure-it-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hailed</a> as tech’s <a href="https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/how-and-why-the-tech-giants-are-fighting-for-the-home-platform-811f5b6174e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big computing platform</a>, would experience flat revenues of $15 billion in 2021, with unit sales up 11%.</p><p>The CTA says its stagnant forecast is merely a function of competition, as an influx of device makers drive down the cost of hardware. But as someone who’s been living with various smart home gadgets for several years now, I have a different theory: They’re just not worth a big investment unless you have a limitless supply of time and patience.</p><h2>An airing of grievances</h2><p>When you press a button on your phone—say, to make a phone call or take a photo—you probably expect that button to work every time. But that’s not the way things work with smart home devices.</p></div><div><p>Just this week, for instance, the two Alexa-connected blinds in my bedroom failed to roll down at their scheduled time, and this morning, only one of them opened back up again. I have no idea what went wrong, because Alexa doesn’t offer any feedback when things fail, so all I could do was try again until the routine triggered properly.</p><p>Those kinds of misfires are common in the smart home world. I’ve had Google Assistant refuse to set alarms or read upcoming calendar events for several days in a row, only to fix itself without explanation. My Ecobee thermostat occasionally gets stuck on a single temperature, requiring a reboot. I’ve had light bulbs inexplicably fail to connect to their hub device. And I’m pretty confident that every Echo speaker owner has experienced Alexa playing the wrong music at least once.</p><p>The problem, says Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, is that smart home devices haven’t gotten much better at avoiding these problems even as the market edges toward mainstream users. Instead, a proliferation of new devices and use cases has multiplied the ways in which things to go wrong.</p></div><div><p>“At the beginning, you obviously had early adopters who usually have a higher level of patience,” she says. “But now that the market is somewhat mature, you’re not going to stand for that. You’re not going to be happy if you can’t rely on it. If your alarm doesn’t go off, there are consequences.”</p><h2>Too many choices</h2><p>Making sense of what to buy in the first place also brings its own challenges. Chaos reigns at every step in the smart home purchase process, and you can easily end up with a pile of devices that don’t work together. The SmartThings lights in my bedroom don’t work with Apple’s Siri assistant, and my Tilt blinds only work with Alexa. To control my Liftmaster garage door opener by voice, I must first connect it through a third-party service called <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFTTT</a>. The Philips Wiz smart bulb outside my office don’t work with Apple’s HomeKit system (though Philips’s separate Hue lighting brand does).</p><p>Even the relatively simple act of playing music across multiple smart speakers involves a mess of proprietary protocols. The Sonos Beam soundbar responds to voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa, but only supports multi-room audio with other Sonos or Apple AirPlay speakers. To connect my soundbar with Google Home or Echo devices in other rooms, I’d have to plug a Chromecast or Fire TV (or both) into my television first.</p></div><div><p>A couple weeks ago, I also lost control of my SmartThings light bulbs entirely. That’s because Samsung decided to stop supporting a product it launched three years ago for <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3239730/samsung-smartthings-link-for-nvidia-shield-tv-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming box into a SmartThings device hub</a>. I’ve yet to set up the replacement hub that Samsung offered at a discount, because it requires pairing every bulb all over again. (Owners of Wink smart home hubs went through a similar ordeal last year, when that company switched to a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/wink-delays-subscription-service-one-week-in-response-to-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mandatory subscription model</a>.)</p><p>When I explain this temporary inconvenience to my wife, she rightfully rolls her eyes. While she’s been a good sport about my smart home endeavors, she’s also keenly aware of how annoying they can be.

The inherent wonkiness of our current setup has permanently dissuaded her from entire categories of devices—most notably, smart door locks—and we’ve mutually decided against installing security cameras of any kind.

He points to robots as a big area of potential growth, with the industry moving beyond basic vacuums and into floor washers and lawn mowers.</p><p>“Over time, as people continue to improve their homes, they’ll see opportunities to upgrade to connected devices and build out their home network,” Kowalski says.</p><div id="pullquote--90660570"><blockquote><p>Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own.</p></blockquote></div><p>He’s probably right, in the sense that people will slowly amass patchworks of gadgets in the same way that I have over the past few years. But the original promise of the smart home wasn’t merely about automating a handful of random tasks. Companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google were instead supposed to provide a kind of central intelligence for the home, tying together an array of devices in clever and delightful ways. The idea is that a smart alarm clock would know to open your blinds and turn on the lights in the morning, or that your sleep tracker would know to turn the thermostat down when you’re not resting comfortably.</p></div><div><p>Today, those companies are still figuring out exactly how to do all that. Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own, such as Home- and Away-based automation routines. Apple still has two separate interfaces for home automation—one through its Home app, and another through Shortcuts. Amazon still maintains three separate smart home systems through Alexa, Ring, and Blink. Only recently have all three tech giants agreed on a <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single wireless smart home protocol</a>, which would reduce the number of bridges and hubs people have to install.</p><p>It’s all just so hopelessly confusing right now, and it’s probably not going to get better anytime soon.</p><p>“People continue to buy thermostats and locks and lights, but I don’t know that we’ve moved the industry forward from an experience perspective,” Milanesi says. “It’s not actually that smart.”</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></section></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <div>
    <p>A few people have asked me lately what makes for a good podcast.  Since my podcast is far from the most popular, and since most podcasts are not like mine, and do not (and should not) try to be like mine, perhaps I am not the right respondent.  Nonetheless I offered a simple formula:</p>
<p><em>A podcast really works when it is the dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>Or expressed in other words:</p>
<p><em>What makes for a good podcast is the dramatic tension between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>If you think of Russ Roberts at EconTalk, often “the story line” is something like “I am a Mensch and you are a Mensch, and we are going to talk this through together.”  In earlier times, it had more elements of “you are going to put forward some mainstream points, and I am going to push back with market-oriented economics.”</p>
<p>Many of the most famous podcasts are variants of: “We will pretend to be talking about something, but in fact we will exploring new visions of masculinity for a Woke and post-Woke world.”</p>
<p>The visual images and home pages associated with those podcasts are often so…manly.  The T-shirts!  The muscles!  It is also why those podcasts fail so badly at having significant numbers of interesting female guests, addressed on their own terms.</p>
<p>Many episodes of Conversations of Tyler are “I’m going to try to show people just how smart you are, but it will end up a wilder and more precarious ride than you might have thought.”  Occasionally a guest flunks the test (though they might still be smart).  Alternately, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/daniel-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the podcast with Daniel Carpenter</a> was the first episode of “Tyler gets upset at a guest, they really have at it!”</p>
<p>I called my podcast with David Deutsch “weird and testy” — that too is dramatic tension.  One listener <a href="https://twitter.com/jachaseyoung/status/1400254407191580672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>: “Tyler’s delight at having a guest who doesn’t hedge or mealymouth is palpable.”  Few tweeted about the substance of the disagreements.</p>
<p>One woman <a href="https://twitter.com/pupu_tintin/status/1400154143092789252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about it</a>: “Without understanding everything he said, I find myself mentally stimulated &amp; spiritually inspired. Such a purist, an idealist, a truth-seeker w/ religious zeal. Not religious myself, I could see myself eventually submit to his religion”</p>
<p>She meant Deutsch.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1413829597918121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some listeners</a> enjoy how the guests are surprised and delighted by the questions.  With <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alexander-the-grate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander the Grate</a> — the homeless guy — the question was how he would perform at all.  I thought he was excellent and very interesting, but there was real suspense leading up to that point.  “And will Tyler question him just like he does everyone else?”</p>
<p>Get the picture?  I’m not saying these listeners are indifferent to the content, rather they filter it through the unfolding story about the dialogical interaction.  I don’t know of any successful podcasts that violate this principle.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>…some very few podcasts are high level professionals in the same field, with a lot of respect for one another, exploring the space and enjoying each other’s company, especially when effectively “meeting for the first time.” I feel like this is maybe on the order of 1-5% of podcasts I hear. Most podcasts I listen to are “just” very high quality interviews</p></blockquote>
<p>My podcasts with Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss would be examples of that, and there are plenty more out there without yours truly.</p>
<p>So, to use <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansonian rhetoric,</a> “Podcasting isn’t about the podcast!”  If you are seeking to understanding a podcast, including your own, start by asking what the basic story line is.  Where the dramatic tension lies.  Do you have enough dramatic tension in what you are doing?  What is the actual reason why you are not attracting more quality guests of a particular kind?</p>
<p>I am not claiming comparable expertise, but to return to my own endeavors, they are most influenced by: Monty Python’s Flying Circus (especially the interview segments, which maintain remarkable dramatic tension), Seinfeld (wonderful ensemble work), Curb Your Enthusiasm (for how long can you keep people on edge?), and the TNT halftime show with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, etc. (what makes for a dramatic or memorable interjection?).  I doubt those are the right sources for <em>your</em> podcast, but perhaps you should look far and wide as well, rather than just listening to other podcasts.  Howard Stern is perhaps another useful source?</p>
<p>If they had had another season of Seinfeld, would Jerry have to have started (again) dating Elaine?  The dramatic stories in a podcast also need to change and evolve over time, and perhaps I will return to that topic in the future.</p>

                    <p>Worldwide, an estimated 20,000 species of wild and managed insects pollinate flowers, aiding plant reproduction<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.

</figure><p>Intensive agriculture is a multifactorial source of stress on pollinator populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Pollinating insects, such as bees, face the physiological challenge of acute or chronic harm from exposure to various agrochemicals, including fungicides and pesticides, that are used to protect crop plants. They also face nutritional stress arising from the lack of pollen- and nectar-providing wild flowers in large-scale, intensive crop monocultures<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>. Moreover, the industrial transport and use of managed high-density colonies of honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) for crop pollination can increase pollinator exposure to parasites or pathogens<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, and might result in disease spillover to wild pollinators<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>. Over the past decade, the lethal or sublethal effect of combinations of agrochemical, pathogenic or nutritional stressors on bees has been tested in many individual experiments<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter <i>et al</i>. advance this knowledge through a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of interactions between agrochemical, pathogenic and nutritional stressors on multiple aspects of bee health and fitness. Their analysis is notable because of the breadth of bee responses considered (for example, foraging behaviour, memory, mortality and colony reproduction), and for comparisons of the interactions of multiple classes of stressor (for example, agrochemical–parasite, parasite–nutrition, agrochemical–agrochemical and parasite–parasite interactions).</p><p>The authors conducted a monumental literature search that yielded almost 15,000 relevant individual studies. Siviter and colleagues combed through these publications to focus on the experiments that investigated the combined effect of parasites (microorganisms and invertebrates), agrochemicals and nutritional stressors on bee health. The authors selected studies that used a balanced and replicated experimental design, and that provided accessible data (means, standard deviations and sample sizes) for each treatment. This rigorous focus and quality control resulted in a final set of 90 studies being selected for further analysis.</p><p>These studies provide a total of 356 effect sizes (measurements indicating the magnitude of a relationship between factors of interest and a particular outcome) for different stressor and bee-response combinations. The authors accounted for data issues that might have confounded their accurate detection of bee responses. Such challenges included those arising from statistical non-independence of multiple effects reported from a single study, publication biases (for example, the lack of negative results), species skews (honey bee data sets predominated), and how experimental treatments such as pesticide dose compare with what might be realistically encountered in the field (termed field realism).</p><p>Siviter and colleagues tested whether the stressor interactions were synergistic, meaning that their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects, as would be the case if the effect of one stressor on a bee elevates the effect of another stressor. The authors also examined alternative scenarios in which the effects of multiple stressors were antagonistic (the effect of one stressor lessens the effect of another) or additive (the combined effect is equivalent to the sum of the individual effects).</p><p>A consistent message from their analysis is that bee mortality is increased by a synergistic interaction between multiple stressors — the worst-case scenario, indicating a disproportionate effect of multiple stressors on bee survival. Interactions between different agrochemicals, rather than other stressors, drove this overall effect, and this finding held true when accounting for the field realism of the agrochemical doses. This result confirms that the cocktail of agrochemicals that bees encounter in an intensively farmed environment can create a risk to bee populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">14</a></sup>. Multi-stressor interactions involving parasites and nutritional stress (including in combination with agrochemicals) produced additive effects on bee mortality overall.</p><p>The authors’ deeper analysis of the biological complexity, however, revealed large differences between particular parasite groups in terms of the full range of additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects on bee mortality, when considering interactions between different parasites or between different parasites and nutritional stress. This variability in response, together with the lower sample sizes for the interactions involving stressors other than agrochemicals, indicate a caveat to consider and also suggest a need for more research on the combined effects of biological sources of stress.</p><p>It is intriguing that Siviter and colleagues found that additive, not synergistic, effects predominated for the non-lethal effects of stressors on fitness proxies (such as modifications of bee behaviour or reproduction, changes in parasite load or immune function). Such non-lethal changes could ultimately affect bee mortality rates. Consequently, how the observed synergistic effects of agrochemicals on bee mortality arise remains to be established. More work is therefore needed to identify the mechanism that links exposure to behavioural or physiological changes and mortality.</p><p>The majority of the studies in the data set were of managed populations of <i>A. mellifera</i>, so the authors also separately analysed responses at the level of bee genus (<i>Apis</i>, <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Megachile</i> and <i>Osmia</i>). <i>Apis</i> mortality was affected by a synergistic multi-stressor interaction qualitatively similar to the full analysis of all bee genera. Other bee genera exhibited additive or antagonistic mortality responses from many fewer studies. This raises an important point. There is a need for research efforts and regulators to widen their focus from <i>A. mellifera</i> — a single, mostly managed bee species — to other pollinator model organisms, whose different ecology and evolutionary history might result in different responses to stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter and colleagues’ findings of the cumulative negative effect of multi-stressor interactions on bees reinforces the call to evaluate such interactions to avoid unforeseen risks to biodiversity and healthy ecosystems<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. In some regions of the world, regulatory risk-assessment frameworks for plant-protection products are being developed to deal with sublethal, long-term and potentially synergistic effects among stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR15" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">15</a></sup> (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track-category="body text link">go.nature.com/3f4ax5r</a>), but their biological and geographical scope must be extended. The authors acknowledge that the high levels of variability between the studies and parameters investigated demand an appropriately cautious interpretation. However, this highlights the need for worldwide reconsideration of risk-assessment approaches for pesticide regulation.</p><p>Given the widespread loss of habitat resources — such as pollen and nectar sources — from intensively managed agricultural landscapes<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>, nutritional deficits occurred surprisingly infrequently as a mechanism underlying bees’ physiological stress (they accounted for only 58 out of the 365 measurements of effect sizes). A greater consideration of how nutritional stress interacts with exposure to pathogens and agrochemicals is therefore an obvious research gap to fill. Moreover, ensuring that experimental treatments are calibrated to simulate realistic environmental conditions would greatly aid risk assessments. This might include three-way combinations of field-realistic chemical doses and parasite levels, and a spatio-temporal dietary diversity similar to that found in semi-natural or highly human-modified landscapes.</p><p>The next challenge is to look beyond these parasite–nutrition–agrochemical interactions to consider other risks to pollination. Future studies must ultimately consider, through a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, the interplay of nutrition–pathogen–agrochemical interactions alongside the effects of other human-driven changes (such as climate change, pollution, land-use changes and the spread of invasive species)<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Although such assessments would be non-trivial to carry out, they will be vital for understanding and ranking the relative risks to pollinators and pollination that are coming from multiple combinations of pressures resulting from global changes.</p>

<p>Airyx is a new open source OS project that aims to provide a similar experience and some compatibiilty with macOS on x86-64 sytems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://airyx.org/" rel="nofollow">airyx.org</a> or join us on <a href="https://libera.chat" rel="nofollow">Libera IRC</a> in <code>#airyx</code> for more info!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bedef041d3a50f0bd26c945e533853f1520330780bd617f59c49ffb10900001c/68747470733a2f2f6170692e6369727275732d63692e636f6d2f6769746875622f6d737a6f656b2f61697279782e7376673f6272616e63683d6d61696e267461736b3d6169727978"></a></p>
<p>The main design goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>source compatibility with macOS applications (i.e. you could compile a Mac application on Airyx and run it)</li>
<li>similar GUI metaphors and familiar UX (file manager, application launcher, top menu bar that reflects the open application, etc)</li>
<li>compatible with macOS filesystems (HFS+ and APFS) and folder layouts (/Library, /System, /Users, /Volumes, etc)</li>
<li>self-contained applications in <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppDir">folders</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/AppImage">single file</a> and a (mostly) installer-less experience for /Applications</li>
<li>mostly maintain compatibility with the FreeBSD base system and X11 - a standard Unix environment under the hood</li>
<li>compatible with Linux binaries via FreeBSD&#39;s Linux support</li>
<li>eventual compatibility with x86-64 macOS binaries (Mach-O) and libraries</li>
<li>pleasant to use, secure, stable, and performant</li>
</ul>

Abstract

   This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are suited
   for use as a database key.

   A common case for modern applications is to create a unique
   identifier for use as a primary key in a database table.  This
   identifier usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable
   using the monotonic creation time in the most significant bits.  In
   addition the identifier is highly collision resistant, difficult to
   guess, and provides minimal security attack surfaces.  None of the
   existing UUID versions, including UUIDv1, fulfill each of these
   requirements in the most efficient possible way.  This document is a
   proposal to update [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] with three new UUID versions that
   address these concerns, each with different trade-offs.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


<span><a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Background</span>

   A lot of things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally
   created.  Modern applications have a need to use (and many have
   already implemented) UUIDs as database primary keys.

   The motivation for using UUIDs as database keys stems primarily from
   the fact that applications are increasingly distributed in nature.
   Simplistic &#34;auto increment&#34; schemes with integers in sequence do not
   work well in a distributed system since the effort required to
   synchronize such numbers across a network can easily become a burden.
   The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique and reasonably short
   values in distributed systems without requiring synchronization makes
   them a good candidate for use as a database key in such environments.

   However some properties of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] UUIDs are not well suited to
   this task.  First, most of the existing UUID versions such as UUIDv4
   have poor database index locality.  Meaning new values created in
   succession are not close to each other in the index and thus require
   inserts to be performed at random locations.  The negative
   performance effects of which on common structures used for this
   (B-tree and its variants) can be dramatic.  As such newly inserted
   values SHOULD be time-ordered to address this.

   While it is true that UUIDv1 does contain an embedded timestamp and
   can be time-ordered; UUIDv1 has other issues.  It is possible to sort
   Version 1 UUIDs by time but it is a laborious task.  The process
   requires breaking the bytes of the UUID into various pieces, re-
   ordering the bits, and then determining the order from the
   reconstructed timestamp.  This is not efficient in very large
   systems.  Implementations would be simplified with a sort order where
   the UUID can simply be treated as an opaque sequence of bytes and
   ordered as such.

   After the embedded timestamp, the remaining 64 bits are in essence
   used to provide uniqueness both on a global scale and within a given
   timestamp tick.  The clock sequence value ensures that when multiple
   UUIDs are generated for the same timestamp value are given a
   monotonic sequence value.  This explicit sequencing helps further
   facilitate sorting.  The remaining random bits ensure collisions are
   minimal.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   Furthermore, UUIDv1 utilizes a non-standard timestamp epoch derived
   from the Gregorian Calendar.  More specifically, the Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond intervals since
   00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.  Implementations and many languages may
   find it easier to implement the widely adopted and well known Unix
   Epoch, a custom epoch, or another timestamp source with various
   levels of timestamp precision required by the application.

   Lastly, privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
   address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC addresses
   can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and reveal
   various other information about such machines (minimally
   manufacturer, potentially other details).  Instead &#34;cryptographically
   secure&#34; pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) or pseudo-random
   number generators (PRNG) SHOULD be used within an application context
   to provide uniqueness and unguessability.

   Due to the shortcomings of UUIDv1 and UUIDv4 details so far, many
   widely distributed database applications and large application
   vendors have sought to solve the problem of creating a better time-
   based, sortable unique identifier for use as a database key.  This
   has lead to numerous implementations over the past 10+ years solving
   the same problem in slightly different ways.

   While preparing this specification the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

   An inspection of these implementations details the following trends
   that help define this standard:

      - Timestamps MUST be k-sortable.  That is, values within or close
      to the same timestamp are ordered properly by sorting algorithms.
      - Timestamps SHOULD be big-endian with the most-significant bits
      of the time embedded as-is without reordering.
      - Timestamps SHOULD utilize millisecond precision and Unix Epoch
      as timestamp source.  Although, there is some variation to this
      among implementations depending on the application requirements.
      - The ID format SHOULD be Lexicographically sortable while in the
      textual representation.
      - IDs MUST ensure proper embedded sequencing to facilitate sorting
      when multiple UUIDs are created during a given timestamp.
      - IDs MUST NOT require unique network identifiers as part of
      achieving uniqueness.
      - Distributed nodes MUST be able to create collision resistant
      Unique IDs without a consulting a centralized resource.

<span><a id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Summary of Changes</span>

   In order to solve these challenges this specification introduces
   three new version identifiers assigned for time-based UUIDs.

   The first, UUIDv6, aims to be the easiest to implement for
   applications which already implement UUIDv1.  The UUIDv6
   specification keeps the original Gregorian timestamp source but does
   not reorder the timestamp bits as per the process utilized by UUIDv1.
   UUIDv6 also requires that pseudo-random data MUST be used in place of
   the MAC address.  The rest of the UUIDv1 format remains unchanged in
   UUIDv6.  See <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>

   Next, UUIDv7 introduces an entirely new time-based UUID bit layout
   utilizing a variable length timestamp sourced from the widely
   implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source.  The
   timestamp is broken into a 36-bit integer sections part, and is
   followed by a field of variable length which represents the sub-
   second timestamp portion, encoded so that each bit from most to least
   significant adds more precision.  See <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>

   Finally, UUIDv8 introduces a relaxed time-based UUID format that
   caters to application implementations that cannot utilize UUIDv1,
   UUIDv6, or UUIDv7.  UUIDv8 also future-proofs this specification by
   allowing time-based UUID formats from timestamp sources that are not
   yet be defined.  The variable size timestamp offers lots of
   flexibility to create an implementation specific RFC compliant time-
   based UUID while retaining the properties that make UUID great.  See
   <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>

   The UUID length of 16 octets (128 bits) remains unchanged.  The
   textual representation of a UUID consisting of 36 hexadecimal and

   readability.  In addition the position of both the Version and
   Variant bits remain unchanged in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv6 aims to be the easiest to implement by reusing most of the
   layout of bits found in UUIDv1 but with changes to bit ordering for
   the timestamp.  Where UUIDv1 splits the timestamp bits into three
   distinct parts and orders them as time_low, time_mid,
   time_high_and_version.  UUIDv6 instead keeps the source bits from the
   timestamp intact and changes the order to time_high, time_mid, and
   time_low.  Incidentally this will match the original 60-bit Gregorian
   timestamp source.  The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from
   their usage and position in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  The 48-bit node MUST be set
   to a pseudo-random value.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 1

<span><a id="section-4.3.3" href="#section-4.3.3">4.3.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv6 node bits SHOULD be set to a 48-bit random or pseudo-random
   number.  UUIDv6 nodes SHOULD NOT utilize an IEEE 802 MAC address or
   the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.5">[RFC4122], Section 4.5</a> method of generating a random multicast

<span><a id="section-4.3.4" href="#section-4.3.4">4.3.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The following implementation algorithm is based on [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] but with
   changes specific to UUIDv6:

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time as a 60-bit count of 100-nanosecond
        intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.

   3.   Set the time_low field to the 12 least significant bits of the
        starting 60-bit timestamp.

   4.   Truncate the timestamp to the 48 most significant bits in order
        to create time_high_and_time_mid.

   5.   Set the time_high field to the 32 most significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

   6.   Set the time_mid field to the 16 least significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   7.   Create the 16-bit time_low_and_version by concatenating the
        4-bit UUIDv6 version with the 12-bit time_low.

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp generate
        a random 14-bit clock sequence value.

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value.

   10.  Complete the 16-bit clock sequence high, low and reserved
        creation by concatenating the clock sequence onto UUID variant
        bits which take the most significant position in the 16-bit
        value.

   11.  Generate a 48-bit psuedo-random node.

   12.  Format by concatenating the 128 bits from each parts:
        time_high|time_mid|time_low_and_version|variant_clk_seq|node

   13.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   The steps for splitting time_high_and_time_mid into time_high and
   time_mid are optional since the 48-bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order as time_high_and_time_mid during the
   final concatenation.  This extra step of splitting into the most
   significant 32 bits and least significant 16 bits proves useful when
   reusing an existing UUIDv1 implementation.  In which the following
   logic can be applied to reshuffle the bits with minimal
   modifications.

<span><a id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  UUIDv7 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   The UUIDv7 format is designed to encode a Unix timestamp with
   arbitrary sub-second precision.  The key property provided by UUIDv7
   is that timestamp values generated by one system and parsed by
   another are guaranteed to have sub-section precision of either the
   generator or the parser, whichever is less.  Additionally, the system
   parsing the UUIDv7 value does not need to know which precision was
   used during encoding in order to function correctly.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 2

<span><a id="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 utilizes a 36-bit big-endian unsigned Unix Timestamp value
   (number of seconds since the epoch of 1 Jan 1970, leap seconds
   excluded so each hour is exactly 3600 seconds long).

   Additional sub-second precision (millisecond, nanosecond,
   microsecond, etc) MAY be provided for encoding and decoding in the
   remaining bits in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 SHOULD utilize a motonic sequence counter to provide
   additional sequencing guarantees when multiple UUIDv7 values are
   created in the same UNIXTS and SUBSEC timestamp.  The amount of bits
   allocates to the sequence counter depend on the precision of the
   timestamp.  For example, a more accurate timestamp source using
   nanosecond precision will require less clock sequence bits than a
   timestamp source utilizing seconds for precision.  For best
   sequencing results the sequence counter SHOULD be placed immediately
   after available sub-second bits.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  UUIDv7 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 implementations, even with very detailed sub-second precision
   and the optional sequence counter, MAY have leftover bits that will
   be identified as the Node for this section.  The UUIDv7 Node MAY
   contain any set of data an implementation desires however the node
   MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure global uniqueness.
   In most scenarios the node SHOULD be filled with pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv7 bit layout for encoding and decoding are described

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.4.1">4.4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Encoding</span>

   Since the UUIDv7 Unix timestamp is fixed at 36 bits in length the
   exact layout for encoding UUIDv7 depends on the precision (number of
   bits) used for the sub-second portion and the sizes of the optionally
   desired sequence counter and node bits.

   Three examples of UUIDv7 encoding are given below as a general
   guidelines but implementations are not limited to just these three
   examples.

   All of these fields are only used during encoding, and during
   decoding the system is unaware of the bit layout used for them and
   considers this information opaque.  As such, implementations
   generating these values can assign whatever lengths to each field it
   deems applicable, as long as it does not break decoding compatibility
   (i.e.  Unix timestamp (unixts), version (ver) and variant (var) have
   to stay where they are, and clock sequence counter (seq), random
   (random) or other implementation specific values must follow the sub-
   second encoding).

   In Figure 3 the UUIDv7 has been created with millisecond precision
   with the available sub-second precision bits.

   Examining Figure 3 one can observe:

   *  The first 36 bits have been dedicated to the Unix Timestamp
      (unixts)

   *  All 12 bits of scenario subsec_a is fully dedicated to millisecond
      information (msec).

   *  The 4 Version bits remain unchanged (ver).

   *  All 12 bits of subsec_b have been dedicated to a motonic clock
      sequence counter (seq).

   *  The 2 Variant bits remain unchanged (var).

   *  Finally the remaining 62 bits in the subsec_seq_node section are
      layout is filled out with random data to pad the length and
      provide guaranteed uniqueness (rand).

          Figure 5: UUIDv7 Field and Bit Layout - Encoding Example
                           (Nanosecond Precision)

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.4.2">4.4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Decoding</span>

   When decoding or parsing a UUIDv7 value there are only two values to
   be considered:

   1.  The unix timestamp defined as unixts

   2.  The sub-second precision values defined as subsec_a, subsec_b,
       and subsec_seq_node

   As detailed in Figure 2 the unix timestamp (unixts) is always the
   first 36 bits of the UUIDv7 layout.

   Similarly as per Figure 2, the sub-second precision values lie within
   subsec_a, subsec_b, and subsec_seq_node which are all interpreted as
   sub-second information after skipping over the version (ver) and
   (var) bits.  These concatenated sub-second information bits are
   interpreted in a way where most to least significant bits represent a
   further division by two.  This is the same normal place notation used
   to express fractional numbers, except in binary.  For example, in
   decimal &#34;.1&#34; means one tenth, and &#34;.01&#34; means one hundredth.  In this
   subsec field, a 1 means one half, 01 means one quarter, 001 is one
   eighth, etc.  This scheme can work for any number of bits up to the
   maximum available, and keeps the most significant data leftmost in
   the bit sequence.

   To perform the sub-second math, simply take the first (most
   significant/leftmost) N bits of subsec and divide it by 2^N.  Take
   for example:

   1.  To parse the first 16 bits, extract that value as an integer and
       divide it by 65536 (2 to the 16th).




<span>Peabody &amp; Davis          Expires 28 October 2021               [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr/><!--NewPage--><pre><span id="page-16"></span>
<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   2.  If these 16 bits are 0101 0101 0101 0101, then treating that as
       an integer gives 0x5555 or 21845 in decimal, and dividing by
       65536 gives 0.3333282

   This sub-second encoding scheme provides maximum interoperability
   across systems where different levels of time precision are
   required/feasible/available.  The timestamp value derived from a
   UUIDv7 value SHOULD be &#34;as close to the correct value as possible&#34;
   when parsed, even across disparate systems.

   Take for example the starting point for our next two UUIDv7 parsing
   scenarios:

   1.  System A produces a UUIDv7 with a microsecond-precise timestamp
       value.

   2.  System B is unaware of the precision encoded in the UUIDv7
       timestamp by System A.

   Scenario 1:

   1.  System B parses the embedded timestamp with millisecond
       precision.  (Less precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B SHOULD return the correct millisecond value encoded by
       system A (truncated to milliseconds).

   Scenario 2:

   1.  System B parses the timestamp with nanosecond precision.  (More
       precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B&#39;s value returned SHOULD have the same microsecond level
       of precision provided by the encoder with the additional
       precision down to nanosecond level being essentially random as
       per the encoded random value at the end of the UUIDv7.

<span><a id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  UUIDv8 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv8 offers variable-size timestamp, clock sequence, and node
   values which allow for a highly customizable UUID that fits a given
   application needs.

   UUIDv8 SHOULD only be utilized if an implementation cannot utilize
   UUIDv1, UUIDv6, or UUIDv8.  Some situations in which UUIDv8 usage
   could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp source not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp bit layout not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like a specific level of precision within
      the timestamp not offered by current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID node other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the usage of one of the current time-based UUIDs.

   Roughly speaking a properly formatted UUIDv8 SHOULD contain the
   following sections adding up to a total of 128-bits.

      - Timestamp Bits (Variable Length)
      - Clock Sequence Bits (Variable Length)
      - Node Bits (Variable Length)
      - UUIDv8 Version Bits (4 bits)
      - UUID Variant Bits (2 Bits)

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific time-based UUIDs.  To be clear:
   UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
   filled with random data.  UUIDv8&#39;s 128 bits (including the version
   and variant) SHOULD contain at the minimum a timestamp of some format
   in the most significant bit position followed directly by a clock
   sequence counter and finally a node containing either random data or
   implementation specific data.

   A sample format in Figure 6 is used to further illustrate the point
   for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv8.

                   Figure 6: UUIDv8 Field and Bit Layout

   timestamp_32:
      The most significant 32 bits of the desired timestamp source.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3).

   timestamp_48:
      The next 16-bits of the timestamp source when a timestamp source
      with at least 48 bits is used.  When a 32-bit timestamp source is
      utilized, these bits are set to 0.  Occupies bits 32 through 47

   ver:
      The 4 bit UUIDv8 version (1000).  Occupies bits 48 through 51.

   time_or_seq:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp is used these 12-bits are used
      to fill out the remaining timestamp.  If a 32 or 48-bit timestamp
      is leveraged a 12-bit clock sequence MAY be used.  Together ver
      and time_or_seq occupy bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   var:
      2-bit UUID variant (10)

   seq_or_node:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp source is leverages these 8 bits
      SHOULD be allocated for an 8-bit clock sequence counter.  If a 32
      or 48 bit timestamp source is used these 8-bits SHOULD be set to
      random.

   node:
      In most implementations these bits will likely be set to pseudo-
      random data.  However, implementations utilize the node as they
      see fit.  Together var, seq_or_node, and node occupy Bits 64
      through 127 (octets 8-15)

<span><a id="section-4.5.1" href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a>.  UUIDv8 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv8&#39;s usage of timestamp relaxes both the timestamp source and
   timestamp length.  Implementations are free to utilize any
   monotonically stable timestamp source for UUIDv8.

   Some examples include:

      - Custom Epoch
      - NTP Timestamp
      - ISO 8601 timestamp

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   The relaxed nature UUIDv8 timestamps also works to future proof this
   specification and allow implementations a method to create compliant
   time-based UUIDs using timestamp source that might not yet be
   defined.

   Timestamps come in many sizes and UUIDv8 defines three fields that
   can easily used for the majority of timestamp lengths:

   *  32-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and setting timestamp_48 to
      0s

   *  48-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and timestamp_48 entirely

   *  60-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq

   *  64-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq and truncating the timestamp the 60 most significant
      bits.

   Although it is possible to create a timestamp larger than 64-bits in
   size The usage and bit layout of that timestamp format is up to the
   implementation.  When a timestamp exceeds the 64th bit (octet 7),
   extra care must be taken to ensure the Variant bits are properly
   inserted at their respective location in the UUID.  Likewise, the
   Version MUST always be implemented at the appropriate location.

   Any timestamps that does not entirely fill the timestamp_32,
   timestamp_48 or time_or_seq MUST set all leftover bits in the least
   significant position of the respective field to 0.  For example a
   36-bit timestamp source would fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits
   of timestamp_48.  The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set
   to 0.

   By using implementation-specific timestamp sources it is not
   guaranteed that devices outside of the application context are able
   to extract and parse the timestamp from UUIDv8 without some pre-
   existing knowledge of the source timestamp used by the UUIDv8
   implementation.

<span><a id="section-4.5.2" href="#section-4.5.2">4.5.2</a>.  UUIDv8 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   A clock sequence MUST be used with UUIDv8 as added sequencing
   guarantees when multiple UUIDv8 will be created on the same clock
   tick.  The amount of bits allocated to the clock sequence depends on
   the precision of the timestamp source.  For example, a more accurate
   timestamp source using nanosecond precision will require less clock
   sequence bits than a timestamp source utilizing seconds for
   precision.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 generically defines two possible clock
   sequence values that can leveraged:

   *  12-bit clock sequence using time_or_seq for use when the timestamp
      is less than 48-bits which allows for 4095 UUIDs per clock tick.
   *  8-bit clock sequence using seq_or_node when the timestamp uses
      more than 48-bits which allows for 255 UUIDs per clock tick.

   An implementation MAY use both time_or_seq and seq_or_node for clock
   sequencing however it is highly unlikely that 20-bits of clock
   sequence are needed for a given clock tick.  Furthermore, more bits
   from the node MAY be used for clock sequencing in the event that
   8-bits is not sufficient.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.5.3" href="#section-4.5.3">4.5.3</a>.  UUIDv8 Node Usage</span>

   The UUIDv8 Node MAY contain any set of data an implementation desires
   however the node MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure
   global uniqueness.  In most scenarios the node will be filled with
   pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 defines 2 sizes of Node depending on
   the timestamp size:

   *  62-bit node encompassing seq_or_node and node Used when a
      timestamp of 48-bits or less is leveraged.
   *  54-bit node when all 60-bits of the timestamp are in use and the
      seq_or_node is used as clock sequencing.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   An implementation MAY choose to allocate bits from the node to the
   timestamp, clock sequence or application-specific embedded field.  It
   is recommended that implementation utilize a node of at least 48-bits
   to ensure global uniqueness can be guaranteed.

<span><a id="section-4.5.4" href="#section-4.5.4">4.5.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The entire usage of UUIDv8 is meant to be variable and allow as much
   customization as possible to meet specific application/language
   requirements.  As such any UUIDv8 implementations will likely vary
   among applications.

   The following algorithm is a generic implementation using Figure 6
   and the recommendations outlined in this specification.

   *32-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to all 0s

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (time_or_node) to 0

   7.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (time_or_node).

   8.   Set the variant to binary 10

   9.   Generate 62 random bits and fill in 8-bits for seq_or_node and
        54-bits for the node.

   10.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   11.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *48-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
       bits.

   3.  Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 most significant bits
       from the timestamp

   4.  Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 least significant bits from the
       timestamp

   5.  The rest of the steps are the same as the previous example.

   *60-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 middle bits from the timestamp

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   Set 12-bit time_or_node to the 12 least significant bits from
        the timestamp

   7.   Set the variant to 10

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (seq_or_node) to 0

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (seq_or_node).

   10.  Generate 54 random bits and fill in the node

   11.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

   12.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *64-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.  The same steps as the 60-bit timestamp can be utilized if the
       64-bit timestamp is truncated to 60-bits.

   2.  Implementations MAY chose to truncate the most or least
       significant bits but it is recommended to utilize the most
       significant 60-bits and lose 4 bits of precision in the
       nanoseconds or microseconds position.

   *General algorithm for generation of UUIDv8 not defined here:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as desired
       bit total

   3.  Set total amount of bits for timestamp as required in the most
       significant positions of the 128-bit UUID

   4.  Care MUST be taken to ensure that the UUID Version and UUID
       Variant are in the correct bit positions.

       UUID Version: Bits 48 through 51

       UUID Variant: Bits 64 and 65

   5.  If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted) or
       the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
       desired clock sequence value to 0

   6.  If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
       or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
       value.

   7.  Set the remaining bits to the node as pseudo-random data

   8.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits together

   9.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to the
       stable store

<span><a id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Encoding and Storage</span>

   The existing UUID hex and dash format of 8-4-4-4-12 is retained for
   both backwards compatibility and human readability.

   For many applications such as databases this format is unnecessarily
   verbose totaling 288 bits.

   *  8-bits for each of the 32 hex characters = 256 bits
   *  8-bits for each of the 4 hyphens = 32 bits

   Where possible UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database applications as
   the underlying 128-bit binary value.

<span><a id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Global Uniqueness</span>

   UUIDs created by this specification offer the same guarantees for
   global uniqueness as those found in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  Furthermore, the
   time-based UUIDs defined in this specification are geared towards
   database applications but MAY be used for a wide variety of use-
   cases.  Just as global uniqueness is guaranteed, UUIDs are guaranteed
   to be unique within an application context within the enterprise
   domain.

<span><a id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Distributed UUID Generation</span>

   Some implementations might desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve 2 or more applications independently
   generating UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  UUIDs
   already feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of
   collision are low.  However, implementations MAY dedicate a portion
   of the node&#39;s most significant random bits to a pseudo-random
   machineID which helps identify UUIDs created by a given node.  This
   works to add an extra layer of collision avoidance.

   This machine ID MUST be placed in the UUID proceeding the timestamp
   and sequence counter bits.  This position is selected to ensure that
   the sorting by timestamp and clock sequence is still possible.  The
   machineID MUST NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address.  The creation and
   negotiation of the machineID among distributed nodes is out of scope
   for this specification.

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span><a id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and MUST not be used for
   node generation.  As such they have been strictly forbidden from
   time-based UUIDs within this specification.  Instead pseudo-random
   bits SHOULD selected from a source with sufficient entropy to ensure
   guaranteed uniqueness among UUID generation.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with the clock sequence does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and it&#39;s corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>]
   UUIDv4 SHOULD be utilized.

   The machineID portion of node, described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, does provide
   small unique identifier which could be used to determine which
   application is generating data but this machineID alone is not enough
   to identify a node on the network without other corresponding data
   points.  Furthermore the machineID, like the timestamp+sequence, does
   not provide any context about the data the corresponds to the UUID or
   the current state of the application as a whole.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
        
                
                                                    
            <p>When it comes to internet speed tests, <a href="https://www.ookla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Speedtest</a> is the gold standard. So when Ookla examined its data for <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Starlink</a> and its satellite internet rivals, <a href="https://www.hughesnet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">HughesNet</a> and <a href="https://www.viasat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Viasat</a>, the numbers it comes up with are meaningful. </p>
		    

                        
    	<p>To no great surprise, <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-hughesnet-viasat-performance-q2-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla found Starlink beats HughesNet and Viasat handly</a>. The company found that &#34;Starlink was the only satellite internet provider in the United States with fixed-broadband-like latency figures, and median download speeds fast enough to handle most of the needs of modern online life at 97.23 Megabits per second (Mbps) during Q2 2021. HughesNet was a distant second at 19.73 Mbps and Viasat third at 18.13 Mbps.&#34;</p><p>As for latency, the time between when you start an activity over the internet and when you get a response back, it&#39;s not even a competition. Starlink&#39;s median latency, 45 milliseconds (ms) is close to fixed broadband&#39;s 14 ms. Low latency is vital for voice and video calling, gaming, and live content streaming. By comparison, Viasat, 630 ms, and HughesNet, 724 ms, are almost unusable for these purposes. </p><p>Why was there such a huge difference? It&#39;s simple physics. Unless we ever get <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-unveils-blueprint-quantum-internet-launch-future-quantum-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">quantum networking</a>, we can&#39;t network faster than the speed of light. Starlink uses low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, flying above us at a relatively close 550 to 1,200 kilometers (km), while HughesNet and Viasat have far higher geosynchronous orbits of about 35,000km.</p><p>Of course, even Starlink isn&#39;t as fast as cable or fiber-based internet. According to Ookla, the median fixed-broadband in the US is 115.22Mbps with a latency of 15ms. But, Starlink was never meant to compete with Earth-bound internet in cities and suburbs. It&#39;s meant to offer an alternative to people living in the country. There I know people who are still using -- yes, I&#39;m serious -- dial-up modems and slow-as-dirt DSL connections with speeds that go all the way down to Kilobits per second (Kbps). </p><p>For these users, Starlink is clearly the better choice. But, Starlink is still being rolled out. This means some places at some times get much better performance than others. Ookla found at the top were users in Morgan county, Alabama at 168.30 Mbps, while lagging more than 100 Mbps behind were the residents of Madison County, Indiana.</p><p>Generally speaking, due to how the Starlink satellite constellations are currently set up, the farther North you live, the better your connection. But, as Morgan county shows, that&#39;s not a hard and fast rule. For example, in Canada Starlink&#39;s median download speed of 86.92 Mbps exceeded the country&#39;s median fixed broadband speed of 84.24 Mbps. </p>

    
<p>In other countries, such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom Starlink&#39;s speed vastly beats terrestrial internet speeds. In France, Starlink&#39;s download speed 139.39 Mbps, easily outran the country-wide fixed broadband average speed of 70.81 Mbp. With Germany, the difference is even larger. A German internet user can expect to see a Starlink speed of 107.98 Mbps while its Earth-bound competitors come in at 58.17 Mbps. While in the UK, and not just in those areas of Scotland far away from the usual internet providers, Starlink&#39;s 108.30 Mbps beats fixed broadband, 50.14 Mbps, hollow. Of course, in all cases, Starlink&#39;s latency will be slower than its territorial competitors. You can&#39;t beat physics. </p><p>You might be wondering how HughesNet and Viasat can stay in business. The reason for that is simple. They&#39;re the only internet game in town in many countries. For instance, in Brazil, Viasat&#39;s 60.30 Mbps download speed is comparable to fixed broadband&#39;s 61.38 Mbps. If you live in the campos, the countryside, you can get Viasat, where you may not have a practical alternative. </p><p>But, while Starlink may sound wonderful, its manufacturing lines are still lagging far behind demand. I, for instance, have yet to see my Starlink Terminal and I ordered it almost six months ago. </p><p>In theory, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">Starlink will be available around the world by September.</a> In practice, I&#39;m not counting on it. </p><p>Is Starlink for everyone? No. But, if you live beyond the reach of conventional high-speed internet or areas with poor general internet service, you&#39;ll want to try to get it. Once in hand, it&#39;s clearly the best satellite internet service.</p><p><strong>Related Stories:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/starlink-satellite-internet-how-does-it-work-cost-features-speed/">Starlink: Elon Musk&#39;s satellite internet explained</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">SpaceX president says Starlink global satellite broadband service to be live by September</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ins-and-outs-of-starlink-internet-from-the-sky/">The ins and outs of Starlink: Internet from the sky</a></li></ul>

    (1,072 miles) across two days to see her for the first time since Covid started.  I was happy to see Mom, happy about the first road-trip in a
    long time, and happy to have tested the hypothesis that, in 2021, a fully-electric vehicle can handle long-haul travel.</p>

<p>My Mom, welcoming us to Saskatchewan. Normally she doesn’t look like the queen.</p>
<p>This essay gathers together the data from the trip and tries to draw
    conclusions. There’s also a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/timbray/status/1422578253835821058">real-time Twitter thread</a> with typos and bad pictures.</p>

<p>To my non-metric readers: Sorry, it’s in km.  I’ll convert a few of the key numbers.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>The experience</span> · 
It was pretty wonderful, actually.  The Jaguar is a comfortable modern car with great seats, good audio, and all the
    automation you’d expect.  It has awesome, overwhelming acceleration power for when you’re in a tricky passing situation.
    My daughter was excellent company.
    Cruising along a good road<span> —</span> and a lot of the Trans-Canada highway
    is<span> —</span> becomes a pretty pleasing experience.</p>

<p>The worst part, by a wide margin, was the wildfire smoke, between us and some of the
    world’s most fantastic scenery.  But that’s a symptom of the onrushing climate crisis, and one of the best things we can do to
    mitigate the devastation is to stop burning fossil fuels to travel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_135917188.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Smoky sun while charging in West Hills Mall, Calgary</p>
<p>Of course, this road trip was different from any previous experience, because charging.  In a fossil car, you don’t have to think,
    you just wait for the tank to get a half or three quarters down, then pull over at the next station.  Recharging requires
    planning; fortunately the tools are pretty good; more on that below.</p>

<p id="p-9"><span>The chargers</span> · 
One reason I decided this experiment was worth trying was Petro-Canada’s message about their
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Electric Highway</a> program, and I quote: “We
    have a charger every 250 km or less from Halifax, N.S. to Victoria, B.C.” There’s one not far from where I live in Vancouver, i
    tried it, and it worked first time with just a credit-card tap, no fuss no muss.</p>

<p>Trouble is, that quote is kind of a lie. There are gaps, and that’s when all the chargers are working, which fairly regularly
    they’re not. But my experience is that Petro-Can, while good, is never your only charging option.</p>

<p>Some background is required here. “High-power” Fast DC chargers come at multiple power levels: I saw 50, 100, 200, and
    350kW. The difference makes a difference.  Our Jag can only really charge at 100kW, but my personal perception is that the
    higher-power chargers fill up that last 20% much faster.  And it feels complicated; for example, in my
    experience with a Co-op Connect charger, rated at “only” 100kW, it felt faster.</p>

<p>When you use these things, they feel like first-generation tech, pushing the edges of what’s possible (or at least
    maintainable). In particular, when you plug a 350kW charger into a car with a really low battery, once it’s finished syncing and
    starts pumping electrons, the sound torques up like a 747 taking off.  And the installations include multiple big tall metal
    boxes (see the picture below).  Also, the huge big thick connecting wire gets super hot to the touch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_041820412.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Charging can be glamorous!</p>
<p>Anyhow, my impression of the Petro-Can network remains mostly positive. The machines work well.  It’s annoying that some are
    100kW, some 200, and some 350, for no obvious reason. It’s annoying that sometimes they’re stuck into a weird grubby back corner of the
    lot in a way that makes it hard to get your car in the right position to reach the charging port with the wire.  But, good on
    ’em.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electrify-canada.ca">Electrify Canada</a> is another organization that’s promising a national network of
    fast chargers. They’re a partner of Electrify America, constructed by Volkswagen as part of their settlement over cheating on
    emissions testing. Anyhow, maybe they’ll be great some day. Once I was far enough into the trip to have Petro-Can fully worked
    out, I tried to find an Electrify charger in working condition but failed.</p>

<p>If you’re OK with using 50kW chargers there are loads and loads of options. Many smaller-town Visitor Centres and and
    Chambers of Commerce put one in, as has my own electrical utility, BC Hydro.  Once you’ve worked with a higher-power charger
    though, they’re just not a satisfying experience.</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>The numbers</span> · 
Each line in the table below represents one driving leg and includes the charging experience at the beginning of that leg (thus absent
    on each day’s initial leg). I think the column headings are mostly pretty obvious, except perhaps
    for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>kWh/h</b> is the amount of juice divided by the driving pause. Often the charger would report less time, which I put down
    to initialization delay, so I think I’m using the right value. The variation here is a little random, because how fast it goes
    depends strongly on how empty your battery is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>km/ch</b> stands for “km per charge-hour”, estimating the amount of road range you
    get per hour of charging. Which I think is a really important number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Network</b>; “PC” is
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Petro-Canada</a>, “Flo”
    <a href="https://www.flo.com/en-CA/">isn’t an acronym</a>, and “Co-op” is
    <a href="https://www.fuel.crs/more/electric">Co-op Connect</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two data sources: The drive-time data is from Jaguar’s trip logging via their
    <a href="https://incontrol.jaguar.com/">Incontrol</a> app; thus the awkwardness caused by non-charge roadside stops.
    The charge-time data is the output from the various charging sessions along the way.  I’m
    certain that neither is perfect, but the results seem intuitively in the right neighborhood, based on my experience.</p>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at the numbers that seem interesting to me.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Charge time</span> · 
17:42 driving, 6:24 charging (including one evening charge after the day’s drive was finished).  Not that great on the face
    of it. Now, it clearly could have been less; since my confidence 
    that any given charger would Just Work started out weak, I was carefully allowing for failures and not running the battery
    very low. Later on in the trip as I gained confidence (specifically in the Petro-Canada network) I was willing to take on things
    like the Calgary-to-Medicine Hat leg, 2:43 and 285.9km, running the battery from 90% down to 11%.</p>

<p>Also my daughter is after all a teen-ager, and perhaps not quite as quick as I moving through cafes
    and restrooms and so on.</p>

<p>Also note that the legs are kind of short; this car can go 400km on a charge. But not when you’re on a big wide modern
    Prairie highway with almost no other traffic, blasting along at 110km/h (65mph) or more, continuously. I think you’d find this
    true of pretty well every electric vehicle.</p>

<p>But, here’s the thing: It didn’t <em>feel</em> excessive. I can only remember a total of maybe fifteen minutes when we were
    consciously just hanging waiting for charge. Most places, we got a coffee or lunch, hit the bathroom, took a walk around the block
    for our knees’ sake, and then it was time to unplug and go.</p>

<p>Having said that, this is a 2019 model-year car and the charging technology is improving. If we’d had a
    Porsche Taycan and nothing but 350kW chargers, the story would have been very different.  Will the fast-charging technology make the leap
    into the mainstream-car price plane? Will 350kW chargers become ubiquitious? I’d like to know.</p>

<p>In this context, there’s another number there that I think is really interesting: The “km/c-h”, how far you can get on an
    hour’s charge. For this particular car on this selection of chargers, it was over 200km (124 miles) per charge-hour.  I think
    that’s enough? Maybe in the lower regions of enough, but there.</p>

<p>And finally, I suspect every driving-safety professional would beam in approval of a power system that forces you to get out
    of the car and move around every couple of hundred km.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>$$$</span> · 
It cost us $120.52 in electricity. Is that a lot or a little?  I tentatively think they’re undercharging. While the
    electricity itself is pretty cheap, the charging infrastructure isn’t. If this is going to work, the charging networks are going
    to have to make money and I don’t see it at these prices.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that at home with the Level 2 charger in the carport, charging feels close to free. Travel maybe doesn’t need to be as
    cheap as the networks are currently making it.</p>

<p>Also, charging by the minute seems wrong. I guess having a time-based component makes sense to keep slow chargers from
    soaking up all the time, but especially at an extra-high-powered charger, a Porsche Taycan is going to get a whole lot more
    range out of each minute than a five-year-old Nissan Leaf, so why should they pay less for the same amount of range? Hmmmm.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>PlugShare</span> · 
If you’ve got a Tesla there’s less planning, the cars know where the Superchargers are.  If you have anything else, you really need
    <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a>.  There are a few apps in this space, but PlugShare is best at showing
    you a map with all the chargers on it, and thus helping you route-plan.  The reason it works is because it’s social; whenever
    you hit a charging station you can “Check In” and leave a note saying whether it’s working and how fast it goes.  This
    dramatically reduces the risk of rolling up to a station and finding it broken.     I absolutely
    don’t think this journey would have been possible without it. </p>

<p>Pro tip: When you’re planning a trip on PlugShare, put in <em>all</em> the chargers you might be able to use as you go along. Then
    when you’re driving, you can look at your remaining range and your upcoming options and most choices become pretty easy.  It’s
    got a limited but decent Android Auto app that I used a lot. (I assume CarPlay too?)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210803_154006840.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Jaguar I-Pace and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_Mach-E">Mustang Mach-E</a> charging up in Hope, BC.</p>
<p id="p-6"><span>Futures</span> · 
A question: Are there enough chargers, or too many?  At the moment, the answer is probably “too many”. One of the things I really
    worried about was limping into some charging station to find all the chargers occupied and having to wait for an hour
    before I could even start.  The picture above shows the only time I saw other humans; a young couple with a
    four-day-old Mustang Mach-E, off for a joyride to Kamloops.  Otherwise, the chargers we visited showed no signs of
    life. Somebody spent a lot of money to build an expensive resource that is today largely un-used.</p>

<p>Having said that, anyone with even a shred of optimism about our future has to believe there are going to be a whole lot more
    battery-electric cars coming. Here in BC at the west edge of Canada we have
    <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/b-c-tops-north-america-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-2020-says-minister">North
    America’s highest EV uptake</a>, pushing 10% of new car sales.</p>

<p>When we were charging at the big Petro-Can station in Kamloops, walking from the the two well-positioned chargers to the
    coffee shop, we went by the gas-sales part, which was <em>massive</em>, at least a dozen pumps and cars lined up for every
    one.</p>

<p>At some point that picture will flip, and there’ll be occasional vendors that still sell gas, but mostly just 
    slick, fast, chargers.  I worry that the process will be kind of painful, but I’m sure it’ll happen. So I hope someone’s
    planning the transition.</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Would you do it again?</span> · 
Definitely.</p>

<p>And everyone should stop driving fossil vehicles starting now. Because the climate crisis is upon us. We can’t prevent it now, but we can save
    lives and reduce destruction if we slash carbon output. There’s no excuse not to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Homeless residents of a state-run tent city in Honolulu, Hawaii, are having their eyes scanned by a robotic police dog.</p><p>Police in the city say it&#39;s a safer way to check for symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>But local civil rights advocates say the use of the robot – called Spot – dehumanises some of Honolulu&#39;s most vulnerable residents.</p><p>&#34;Because these people are houseless it’s considered OK to do that,” said Jongwook Kim, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii. “At some point it will come out again for some different use after the pandemic is over&#34;.</p><h2>&#39;COVID safe&#39;</h2><p>Acting Lt. Joseph O’Neal of the Honolulu Police Department’s community outreach unit defended the robot’s use in a media demonstration earlier this year.</p><p>He said it had protected officers, shelter staff and residents by scanning people’s body temperatures at a shelter where they could quarantine and get tested for COVID-19.</p><p>The robot is also used to remotely interview individuals who have tested positive for the virus.</p><p>&#34;We have not had a single person out there that said, ‘That’s scary, that’s worrisome,’&#34; O’Neal said. &#34;We don’t just walk around and arbitrarily scan people&#34;.</p><p>Police use of such robots is still rare and largely untested — and hasn’t always gone over well with the public.</p><p>Honolulu officials faced a backlash when a local news organisation, Honolulu Civil Beat, revealed that the Spot purchase was made with federal relief money.</p><h2>Public outcry in New York</h2><p>Late last year, the New York Police Department started using Spot after painting it blue and renaming it &#34;Digidog&#34;. It went mostly unnoticed until New Yorkers began spotting it in the wild and posting videos to social media.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the department returned the robot to its manufacturer.</p><p>&#34;This is some Robocop stuff, this is crazy,&#34; was the reaction in April from Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman.</p><p>He was one of several New York politicians to speak out after a widely shared video showed the robot strutting with police officers responding to a domestic-violence report at a high-rise public housing building in Manhattan.</p><p>Days later, after further scrutiny from elected city officials, the department said it was terminating its lease and returning the robot.</p><p>The expensive machine arrived with little public notice or explanation, public officials said, and was deployed to already over-policed public housing. Use of the high-tech canine also clashed with Black Lives Matter calls to defund police operations and reinvest in other priorities.</p><p>In the aftermath of the fiasco, Boston Dynamics, the company that makes the robots, Boston Dynamics, said it needed to do a better job of explaining the technology to the public and customers who have had little experience with it.</p><h2>&#39;Just a tool&#39;</h2><p>For the Dutch national police, one of the company’s customers, explaining the technology includes emphasising that Spot is a very good robot — well-behaved and not so smart after all.</p><p>&#34;It doesn’t think for itself,&#34; Marjolein Smit, director of the special operations unit of the Dutch national police, said of the remote-controlled robot. &#34;If you tell it to go to the left, it will go to the left. If you tell it to stop, it will stop&#34;.</p><p>Earlier this year, her police division sent its robot into the site of a deadly drug lab explosion near the Belgian border to check for dangerous chemicals and other hazards.</p><p>According to Boston Dynamics, its acceptable use guidelines prohibit Spot’s weaponisation or anything that would violate privacy or civil rights laws, which it said puts the Honolulu police in the clear ethically.</p><p>It&#39;s all part of a year-long effort by the company, which in the past relied on military funding, to make its robots seem friendlier and thus more palatable to local governments and consumer-oriented businesses.</p><h2>Military-grade</h2><p>By contrast, a lesser-known rival, Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, has no qualms about weaponisation and supplies its dog-like robots to several branches of the US military and its allies.</p><p>&#34;It’s just plug and play, anything you want,&#34; said Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh, who was critical of Boston Dynamics’ stated ethical principles as &#34;selective morality&#34; because of the company’s past involvement with the military.</p><p>Parikh added that his company doesn’t market its four-legged robots to police departments, though he said it would make sense for police to use them.</p><p>&#34;It’s basically a camera on a mobile device,&#34; he said.</p><p>There are roughly 500 Spot robots now in the wild. Perry said they&#39;re commonly used by utility companies to inspect high-voltage zones and other hazardous areas. Spot is also used to monitor construction sites, mines and factories, equipped with whatever sensor is needed for the job.</p><p>It’s still mostly controlled by humans, though all they have to do is tell it which direction to go and it can intuitively climb stairs or cross over rough terrain. It can also operate autonomously, but only if it’s already memorised an assigned route and there aren’t too many surprise obstacles.</p><h2>Should the police have robots?</h2><p>&#34;The first value that most people see in the robot is taking a person out of a hazardous situation,&#34; Michael Perry, vice president of business development at Boston Dynamics, said.</p><p>Kim, of the ACLU in Hawaii, acknowledged that there might be many legitimate uses for such machines, but said opening the door for police robots that interact with people is probably not a good idea.</p><p>He pointed to how Dallas police in 2016 stuck explosives on a wheeled robot to kill a sniper, fueling an ongoing debate about &#34;killer robots&#34; in policing and warfare.</p><p>&#34;There’s the potential for these robots to increase the militarization of police departments and use it in ways that are unacceptable,&#34; Kim said.</p><p>&#34;Maybe it’s not something we even want to let law enforcement have&#34;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dating in Delhi when you&#39;re poor</title>
      <link>https://www.reuters.com/article/delhi-dating-idUSKBN1DU0NE</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article dir="ltr"><div><p>Anuradha starts her day washing dishes, cups and cutlery in Sarita Vihar, one of New Delhi’s more affluent neighbourhoods. It is one of six apartments that she cleans every day. She mops floors, scrubs bathroom tiles, takes out the garbage and sweeps and wipes the apartment stairs.</p><figure><p><figcaption>People are silhouetted against the setting sun at a park in New Delhi March 10, 2010. REUTERS/B Mathur/Files</figcaption></p></figure><p>She likes to talk to herself while she works. Her employers joke about it, but it’s one way to get through the tedium that comes with spending the work day with her back bent over or on her haunches.</p><p>She meets her boyfriend on Saturdays. That’s her day off, she said as she mopped my apartment stairs. Where do they go? I asked her. What do they do?</p><p>“We generally go to a place which is far from my home. I borrow my employer’s cellphone to call him and decide our plans,” she said.</p><p>She’s the first woman from her family who makes her own money. They’re from Bihar, hundreds of miles to the east, and they’re conservative. In the capital, she prefers wearing jeans and short-sleeved kurtas like the “Delhi girls,” who they see at bus stops and on the metro trains; the ones who go to college and work in offices and set the fashion trends for a growing population of people from the countryside who are looking for work in India’s big cities.</p><p>Unlike those girls and so many other, richer people in Delhi, she and her boyfriend don’t have an option to go out for a date to places that most people who would read this story would go. The 23-year-old earns 8,000 rupees a month ($125) for her work. That’s what her employers can expect to pay for a single “date night” out at one of the city’s finer restaurants.</p><p>Delhi has a per capita annual income of 300,000 rupees ($4,615) - the highest in the country and three times the national average. But nearly half of the city’s population lives in slums without basic services and facilities like drinking water, garbage disposal or a proper drainage system.</p><p>These aren’t the people you will meet out at what online restaurant listing service Zomato calls a typical “romantic dinner” for a couple in Delhi, where the cost for two usually starts at 3,000 rupees ($47) and goes as high as 10,000 ($155), depending on where you go. A movie date with snacks can cost somewhere around 2,500 rupees to an upper-middle class couple.</p><p>For poor people, going on a date requires setting different expectations. Money, where to go and what to do, coupled with a lack of privacy in a densely populated place make for rendezvous that are no less romantic, but decidedly different from what many young people around the world consider a “date.”</p><p>Anuradha usually takes a bus to go to Kalindi Kunj Park or the ruins of the Tughlaqabad fort, both around four kilometres from her home, and that’s where she meets her boyfriend for dates. She lives in one-room flat in the Jhuggi Jhopri colony – a settlement developed by the city government near the easternmost edge of Delhi for poor people as an alternative to illegal slums.</p><p>“I don’t really want any expensive gifts, or to go to big restaurants. These things are superficial,” said Anuradha, who said she likes watching romance movies and is a big Shah Rukh Khan fan.</p><p>When she and her boyfriend meet, they talk about their lives and walk around the park, or eat aloo-chaat or golgappas at a roadside stall. Mostly, the boyfriend, who works as a helper at a general-provision store, pays the bill.</p><p>Then there is the story of Surender and Preeti.</p><p>“We used to gift each other colorful dhaga (sacred threads) or lockets bought from roadside vendors, meet each other on terraces in our colony and convey our messages through our younger cousins or mutual friends,” Surender said. “We used to meet in desolate lanes and ask the younger ones to be on a lookout. That was what we termed as a date. It was years before I took her to have a burger at a McDonalds’ outlet in Connaught Place. It cost me 60 rupees.”</p><p>Surender used to ask Preeti to meet him at a meeting point far from their homes. Dressed up in his best clothes, some cheap jeans and a shirt from counterfeit brands bought from Palika Bazaar, and wearing cologne, his priority was to plan their dates in a way to avoid Delhi’s infamous “eve-teasers,” men who sexually harass women on the street with leers, catcalls and often ironic serenades of lyrics from famous Bollywood film songs.</p><p>“I first saw her in a jagrata (all-night prayer ritual) in my colony and knew she was made for me. Though we used to stare at each other daily, I had to wait for another nine years before I could gather the courage to talk to her. I thought she was too beautiful to be with someone like me.”</p><p>Surender, now 30, won her heart through his romantic poetry.</p><p>Twelve years after they started dating, they married. The family disapproved. Surender’s grandmother and Preeti’s mother were from the same “gotra,” or clan. Hindu clans prohibit marriage within the descendants of an unbroken male line. (Marrying within the “gotra” is one of the primary reasons for recurring “honour killing” of lovers in India.)</p><p>The couple used to meet each other however they could — by bus, auto rickshaw and on foot. “I had a slightly well-off friend from whom I used to borrow clothes, money and often his bike. We never went to malls as everything there was out of my budget. I was also afraid that they would throw us out because we couldn’t speak English.”</p><p>The biggest problem for such couples is a space to meet. Between gossiping neighbours and disapproving family members, not to mention the ubiquitous “aunties,” (middle-aged women) dating can require one immediate commitment: taking the time to go somewhere far from where you live. Often, the destinations are Delhi’s parks.</p><p>Buddha Jayanti Park, Lodhi Gardens, Deer Park, Millennium Indraprastha Park, the Garden of Five Senses and Kalindi Kunj Park are some of the most popular “lovers’ parks”.</p><p>Tucked in the corners or behind the bushes are couples from different parts of the city; kissing or cozying up to each other under a shawl or a bedsheet. In the background in some parks are old Muslim tombs and gumbads (domes), trees and flower gardens, some stray dogs, children at play, old people taking their daily walks alongside tourists, and picnicking families. Everyone learns to take a peek and look away when they see a boy and girl à deux.</p><p>But even poor lovers face a tough crowd.</p><p>“Looks like all the dirt of the city assembles here only,” says a man sitting with his wife and three children under a tree in the Kalindi Kunj Park against the backdrop of the Delhi Eye, a 200-foot-tall ferris wheel.</p><p>Arun believes it’s the man’s persistence to woo them that matters to most women. “People from my strata don’t have the option to trust anyone quickly. How much a person can wait is ultimately the sign of their interest. We don’t swipe each other on apps,” he says while pointing to a cheap smartphone in his hand.</p><p>Even though China-made affordable smartphones are making inroads among India’s poor people, dating apps such as Tinder remain the province of wealthier people because of the social stigma associated with dating and premarital sex.</p><p>“High-profile people like you can go to restaurants or hotels. We have just parks”, says Arun, an 18-year-old commerce student. “Even places like McDonald’s are an option for the ones who have some cash. Most of my friends just take their girls to parks and treat them with jhalmuri (puffed rice mixed with spices). The girls also don’t have that many expectations.”</p><p>Arun sometimes gives his girlfriend a ring bought from the roadside or a simple greeting card, which cost around 10 to 20 rupees.</p><p>He also takes his girlfriend to parks and to the movies, but only on Thursdays when the ticket prices are cheapest as the demand for them generally dwindles on last day before the next film releases on Friday. The matinee shows on these “slow” days cost 100 to 150 rupees, and are usually cheaper than the evening shows on weekends – reaching up to eight times than what Arun pays. They refrain from buying overpriced snacks at the concession stands.</p><p>“A few people I know have collected money to give their girlfriends a mobile phone to talk to them. If the girl’s family gets to know about the secret phone, she gets beaten up by her parents,” he said. “The braver ones run away from home with their lovers. Every once in a while, these stories end up in suicides.”</p></div></article></div></div><p><span data-name="for-phone-only">for-phone-only</span><span data-name="for-tablet-portrait-up">for-tablet-portrait-up</span><span data-name="for-tablet-landscape-up">for-tablet-landscape-up</span><span data-name="for-desktop-up">for-desktop-up</span><span data-name="for-wide-desktop-up">for-wide-desktop-up</span></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Other Invisible Hand</title>

<p>Economics and evolution are basically in the same business: Both are all about productivity selection, though one has been at it for billions of years longer than the other. Both involve “invisible hand” magic — intricate, unplanned, “self-organizing” systems. Unfortunately, economics hasn’t kept up with what natural scientists have discovered about life’s organizing secrets. Nevertheless, economic ideas rule our lives, so it’s critical we apply Leslie Orgel’s second law (“evolution is cleverer than you”) specifically to economics. </p>



<p>For instance, it may surprise many non-biologists to learn that evolution isn’t only about red-in-tooth-and-claw competitive selfishness — it’s also “ruthlessly cooperative.” And protecting life-supporting cooperation requires suppressing certain kinds of selfishness. Biologists, unlike many economists, grasp when the “greed is good” ethos gets deadly.</p>



<p>There’s no real argument about the fact that “the evolution of cooperation is central to all living things.” That’s the first line of a Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334008521_Enforcement_is_central_to_the_evolution_of_cooperation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">paper</a> by the biologists Nicholas Davies, Kevin Foster and Arvid Ågren, and it expresses an utterly uncontroversial view among biologists. The paper examines a “central puzzle”: “Why does evolution favor investment in cooperation rather than self-serving rebellion that would undermine a particular genome, organism or society?” Surely a topic of central concern to economists also. The authors present abundant “evidence that enforcement shapes cooperation across all levels of biology.” Enforcement is defined as “action that evolves … to reduce selfish behavior within a cooperative alliance.” Adding to copious real-world cases, modeling shows that whenever “new selfish elements are introduced to a population, the evolution of suppression is often rapid.” Otherwise, gains from selfishness get ruinously risky. </p>



<p>These evolutionary lessons aren’t related to the two main flavors of critiques of economics that typically command attention. This isn’t about deviations from “rationality” or “market failures.” No matter how perfectly rational imaginary market participants are in responding to fully loaded local incentives, the systemic effects of self-organization are often far from benign. In biology, they’re routinely collectively ruinous. Only certain kinds of self-organizing complex systems enable collectively beneficial results. And billions of years of R&amp;D have taught biology which tricks work.   </p>



<p>Life necessarily operates a Russian doll-like nested hierarchy of cooperation, where selfishness-suppressing enforcement operates at every level. We might call this “coop-cop policing.” </p>

</div>




<p>Every so-called selfish gene also cooperates with the other genes in its genome — the gene team that collectively builds and (co)operates their “survival vehicle” (a.k.a. body). Every complex cell is powered by cooperation (their power plant subcomponents, chloroplasts or mitochondria, result from symbiosis). Every multi-cellular organism is a collaborative “<a href="file:///C:/%20https:/www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2017/11/27/the-philosophy-of-social-evolution-part-4/" data-wpel-link="internal">society of cells</a>.” Group-living species form varying degrees of super-organisms where survival is influenced by the fitness of group mates (social groups become a looser, but often no less necessary, form of extended survival vehicle). And cross-species collaborations abound (symbiosis isn’t rare — it’s the rule). Indeed, as David Haskell, a biologist and writer, notes, a tree is “a community of cells” from many species: “fungus, bacteria, protist, alga, nematode and plant.” And often “the smallest viable genetic unit [is] … the networked community.”</p>



<p>Amazingly, you don’t even need a brain to reap the benefits of being ruthlessly cooperative. Microbes collaborate extensively, for instance in providing biochemical “public goods,” which are predictably protected by coop-cop policies that prevent exploitative free or cheap riding (although we should bear in mind that this is an anthropomorphic analogy, since none of the microbial players has a mind or intentions). The scientific consensus has shifted so much that Richard Dawkins, in the 30th-anniversary edition of “The Selfish Gene,” wrote that he could just as accurately have called his book “The Cooperative Gene.” Perhaps decades of our economic and political lives would have been much less harmful if he had. </p>



<p>A very instructive case of how greed is not good, of self-interest run amok, is cancer. Tumors are a form of cell-level selfishness that all organisms must do their darnedest to suppress. As Athena Aktipis, author of “The Cheating Cell,” and several other evolutionary biologists explain in a 2015 <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0219" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, a defining trait of traitorous cancer cells is that they gain in fitness “at the expense of the organism.” They can’t help but make explicit market parallels, describing two revealingly named cancer strategies as “demographic cheating” and “economic cheating.” Cancer cells cheat on their body’s biological social contract. </p>



<p>Every viable bio-social contract in multi-cellular organisms must enforce this rule: The health of the whole must trump the self-interest of any part. Otherwise, the parts become parasitic, gaining at the expense of the viability of the whole. Unregulated parts can kill their wholes. </p>



<p>Humans are obligated cooperators: To survive, we have no choice but to cooperate with other humans. Indeed, the evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson calls teamwork humanity’s “<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530061-100-what-makes-us-altruistic-and-whats-it-good-for/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">signature adaptation</a>.” We are evolution’s most productive super-cooperators — our economies are our social metabolism, facilitating our techno-political form of globe-spanning super-cooperations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ideas most economists use have been too influenced by “methodological individualism,” rather than the more scientifically supported view of us as a super-social, super-cooperative, intensely interdependent species. Often, this economics-style individualism is of the Thomas Hobbes variety, which paints humans in “a state of nature,” waging a “war of all against all.” </p>



<p>But this influential image and logic is bad science and utterly untrue (and a terrible basis on which to build on the Enlightenment’s ideas about political and economic systems). Charles Darwin wrote an entire book about humans being social creatures. He wrote that any Hobbesian human would be an “unnatural monster.” And contrary to that science-denying slogan of Margaret Thatcher’s, that “there is no such thing as society,” no human has ever survived or thrived without a tribe or society. As Wilson <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/focus-article/reaching-a-new-plateau-for-the-acceptance-of-multilevel-selection/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">puts it</a>, “What made our ancestors different was the ability to collectively suppress … disruptive behaviors within the group, so that cooperating … became the dominant survival strategy.”</p>



<p>Division of labor in biology’s cooperations creates “<a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/the-cheating-cell-an-interview-with-athena-aktipis/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">fitness interdependence</a>.” That’s Aktipis’s term for a mode of joint interests that doesn’t rely on relatedness or reciprocity, the previously popularized ways to explain the evolution of unselfish behaviors (a.k.a. altruism). Once collaboration evolves to be more productive than solo strategies, the game changes — you now need your co-laborers to survive and thrive also. Again, lessons surely sorely needed for a fitter economics and wiser politics. </p>



<p>Speaking of such lessons, Wilson and John Gowdy <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269637211_Human_ultrasociality_and_the_invisible_hand_foundational_developments_in_evolutionary_science_alter_a_foundational_concept_in_economics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">write</a>, “the invisible hand metaphor can be justified … for humans in addition to nonhuman species, [only] when certain conditions are met.” Space precludes the details, but what matters is that this contrasts sharply with core economic assumptions and teachings. As Wilson <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/the-third-way-of-entrepreneurship-in-the-internet-age-a-conversation-with-tim-oreilly/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">explains</a>, the “problem with laissez-faire in all its forms … [is] it is simply profoundly untrue that lower-level agents pursuing their narrow interests — whether an individual, a small firm or a leviathan like Google — robustly benefit the common good.“</p>



<p>Biology’s invisible hand knows better. It has tested over billions of years a mind-bogglingly vast variety of super-complex cooperations — and religiously, rigorously, ruthlessly weeded out the many self-organizing setups that aren’t productive enough or that create collective catastrophe. </p>



<p>We need economic and political equivalents to the evolutionary wisdom of these life-wide logic patterns. For instance, policies that mimic tumor-suppressor genes and coop-cop processes that suppress unenlightened selfishness.  This will require a wholesale revision to the regulation-reviling reflexes of free-marketeers. As Wilson quips, “an unregulated organism is a dead organism.” We need ways to detect and suppress parasitic gains — for example, massive corporations like Amazon that pay zero taxes towards the upkeep of the infrastructure their profits depend on, or likewise billionaires who pay lower tax rates than nurses.</p>

<p>We must explicitly protect our Russian-doll nested survival vehicles: communities, cities, nations, all the way up to the whole planetary biosphere. Our coop-cop policies must prevent us, or others, from gaining by harming any of those. Evolution teaches that without these, collective collapse awaits. </p>



<p>Instead, sadly, current capitalism too often mimics the logic of cancer — unconstrained greed-is-good games have metastasized throughout our body politic. And economists routinely call behaviors “rational” that produce predictably collectively painful or bad outcomes, and which evolution would suppress (like the sado-capitalist backfiring “rationality” that counsels against cooperating in “prisoner’s dilemmas,” or greedy co-suicidal tactics in “tragedy of the commons” cases, which the political scientist Elinor Ostrom showed are solved easily in many cultures not ruled by the ideas of economists).  </p>



<p>In one way, all this should be obvious — ever been on a team? And this logic pattern has been expressed in many ways; in Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America,” which has a chapter called “How the Americans Combat Individualism by the Principle of Interest Rightly Understood.” Despite our ambient certainty that it is natural, Tocqueville describes individualism as a newfangled phenomenon. The word “individualism” itself entered the English language largely through translations of his work. Somehow, our leaders are educated into the error of dangerously discounting this “enlightened self-interest” (also a term Tocqueville invented). </p>



<p>It is in no one’s real interest to weaken or wreck what they (or their descendants) need to survive. This can be spelled out in 15 words, and could be called “needism”: Know your needs. Don’t damage what supplies them. Don’t let others either — or you’re doomed. Cultures either heed the logic of needism, or they perish.</p>



<p>Much popularization work remains to put newer evolutionary lessons on par with pop-science selfish-gene logic. But billions of years of harsh testing have taught all living systems to suppress certain sorts of disruptive selfishness. Economists should reflect long and hard on why the systems they study would be any exception. These yet unnamed natural law patterns limit even what evolution can sustain. </p>



<p>It’s time we hired the other invisible hand explicitly to support the common good. And we need coop-cop regulations of selfishness at every level to avoid parts harming their needed wholes. Otherwise, harsh karma awaits as our co-fate for allowing a plague of parasitic plutocratic plundering.</p>

      <title>Making Sierra Pay</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
														<div id="attachment_4760"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/set-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4760"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-4760">Scenes from the <em>Phantasmagoria</em> set, with Roberta Williams in pride of place at center.</p></div>
<p>At the conclusion of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">my previous article</a> on Sierra Online’s corporate history, we saw how Ken and Roberta Williams moved their company’s headquarters from the tiny Northern California town of Oakhurst to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, home to Microsoft among others, in September of 1993. They did so for a mixture of personal and professional reasons, as Ken has since acknowledged. Their children were getting older, for one thing, and the schools in Oakhurst were far from world-class. Additionally, life in general as the biggest fish of all in the fishbowl of a company town that Oakhurst had become wasn’t always pleasant; for example, Ken has claimed that his kids were at times bullied by “the children of former Sierra employees who had a grudge against Sierra.” Some other former employees suspect still another reason for the move to Bellevue, one that Ken neglects to mention: the fact that Washington State had no personal income tax, while California’s was the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Still, there are no grounds to doubt that the public reason Ken gave for the move back in the day was indeed a major part of the calculation: the need to recruit the sort of seasoned business talent that could take Sierra to the next level. The company’s annual revenues had grown every single year since 1987, more often than not substantially, and this was of course wonderful. But less wonderful was the fact that profits had never been as high as that progression would imply; Sierra had a knack for spending almost every dime they earned. Of late in fact, the bottom line had dipped sharply into loss territory even as revenues continued their steady climb. Under pressure from his shareholders, Ken Williams realized that he had to find a way to make his company start to pay off. He believed that doing so must entail assembling the kind of top-flight management team which could only be found in a big city. He’d been seeking a rock star of a chief financial officer for a long time from Oakhurst to no avail. Ken Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had hired a San Francisco-based company, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, to lead the search, and after months of getting nowhere I called my contact at Heidrick in frustration. “Why do you keep sending me B and C level candidates?” I asked. I was tired of having my time wasted interviewing candidates who were not at the level I was seeking. The answer came back without hesitation: “Ken, you’re aren’t getting it. No A player wants to move to Oakhurst.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nine months after the move to Bellevue, Ken finally found his rock star in the form of one Mike Brochu, a financial whizz who had spent the last nineteen years working for Burlington Resources. The man whom Ken still describes as “probably the best hire I ever made” was a garrulous Texan who “inspired confidence in everyone around him.” Not coincidentally, Sierra began to display a newly hard-nosed, bottom-line-focused attitude toward their business from virtually the moment of his arrival. As one of his first projects, Brochu led the negotiations that resulted in the sale of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/02/the-sierra-network">The ImagiNation Network</a>, Sierra’s visionary but perpetually money-losing online-gaming service, to AT&amp;T for $40 million in cash in November of 1994.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sierra implemented a significant shift in their product-development strategy. For many years now, the heart of the company’s identity had been a set of long-running adventure-game series, most of which worked the word “quest” somewhere into their title. Dodgy from the standpoints of both writing and design though they sometimes were, they’d all displayed enough lovable qualities to worm their way into fans’ hearts. I’ve described in earlier articles how Sierra fandom could feel like belonging to a big extended family. These games, then, were the cousins whom you could always expect to see at the family reunion every couple of years, dressed perhaps a bit differently than last time around but always the same person at bottom. They were comfortingly predictable, and that was exactly how the fans liked them.</p>
<p>But for all that these ramshackle, puzzle-heavy adventure games were good at cementing the loyalty of the already converted, they were less equipped to unleash the sort of explosive growth Sierra was now after. It was a pivotal moment in the history of the personal computer, as Ken Williams and Mike Brochu well recognized. In 1994, more home computers would be sold than televisions, as consumers, tempted by the ease of use of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/08/doing-windows-part-9-windows-comes-home">Microsoft Windows</a>, the magic of multimedia, and rumors of a thing called the World Wide Web, jumped onboard the computing bandwagon in staggering numbers. These people didn’t know a <em>King’s Quest</em> from an <em>Ultima</em>. Reaching them would require a different sort of game: fresher, <em>hotter</em> in the Marshall McLuhan sense, more in tune with what they were seeing on television and at the movies. It seemed like it was now or never for Sierra to capture their interest, even if it meant that some of the old fans were left feeling a bit abandoned.</p>
<p>So, Sierra’ new Bellevue management team took a hard look at their existing series in order to decide which were expendable and which were not. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/07/the-unmaking-and-remaking-of-sierra-on-line"><em>King’s Quest</em></a>, the company’s longstanding flagship series, which already enjoyed a measure of name recognition outside the traditional computer-gaming ghetto, would have been an obvious keeper even if it hadn’t been the baby of Roberta Williams. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards"><em>Leisure Suit Larry</em></a> also had proven appeal with non-traditional demographics, and was thus also a no-brainer to keep around. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/splendid-isolation-sierra-at-mid-decade"><em>Space Quest</em></a> was an edge case, but the managers decided to green-light one more game, if only to throw a bone to the old-school fans. But <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/chief-gates-comes-to-oakhurst-a-cop-drama"><em>Police Quest</em></a> would get revamped from a line of adventure games into a line of tactical 3D action games, while <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/so-you-want-to-be-a-hero"><em>Quest for Glory</em></a> would get the axe entirely. Going forward, the main focus would be on bigger-budget adventures employing filmed human actors, for which Sierra was now building their own sound stage down in Oakhurst at considerable cost. They would make fewer of this new type of adventure, but each of them would be a flashy, high-fidelity production, able to appeal to a mass market weaned on big-screen televisions and CD players. The idea was to make the release of each Sierra adventure from now on a real <em>event</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transition from one product strategy to another came with a pitfall: it would take some time to bring it off, meaning that 1994 would be an unusually quiet year in terms of new games. And that reality, combined with the new management team’s more hard-nosed attitude, meant that some of the folks in Oakhurst must lose their jobs. Among them were Corey and Lori Cole, the husband-and-wife team behind <em>Quest for Glory</em>, who saw their roles cancelled along with the fifth game in their series, the most impressive of all the series in the Sierra lineup in terms of design ambition and innovation. Corey recalls a scene which made it all too clear to everyone present that Sierra was now being run as a business, not a family: “All employees in the meeting were handed envelopes; about half of them contained ‘pink slips’ notifying them that they no longer worked for Sierra. Those employees were escorted back into the building and watched as they retrieved personal belongings from their desks.” Layoffs are never easy. Corey especially remembers the sight of Gano Haine, who had worked on Sierra’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/the-sierra-discovery-adventures">two <em>EcoQuest</em> games and <em>Pepper’s Adventures in Time</em></a>, standing in the parking lot crying: “Sierra had been her dream, and she was so thrilled to have gotten the job there.”</p>
<p>During this year of wrenching transition, Sierra released just one new Oakhurst-built adventure game, making it their least prolific year in that respect in almost a decade. Thankfully for the bean counters, the game in question was the latest installment in Sierra’s most bankable adventure series of them all. <em>King’s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride</em> was a typical entry in a series that had been Sierra’s ever-evolving technological showpiece since 1984. But then, that description in itself implies innovation on at least a technical front, and this the new entry certainly delivered.</p>
<div id="attachment_4788"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/kqvii/" rel="attachment wp-att-4788"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-4788">The <em>King’s Quest VII</em> opening movie. Ken Williams has often said that Walt Disney was one of his biggest role models. With <em>King’s Quest VII</em>, this influence became almost distressingly literal.</p></div>
<p>Although it did not employ filmed actors, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> was indicative in another way of Sierra’s new direction: rather than an interactive movie, it aimed to be an interactive cartoon worthy of comparison to the likes of Disney, an ambition which required it to look beyond Sierra’s own stable of talented in-house artists for some of its visuals. Ken Williams first reached out to an up-and-coming animation studio known as Pixar. He even spoke personally with Steve Jobs, Pixar’s chairman and majority owner, but in the end the studio proved to be simply too busy working on <em>Toy Story</em>, their first full-length feature film, to take on this task as well. So, Sierra ended up contracting sequences out to no fewer than four other outside animation studios, in addition to employing their own artists to create what truly was an audiovisual extravaganza by the standards of its time. <em>King’s Quest VII</em> went full Disney, as Charles Ardai described in his review for <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>I tried this game on my mother (a big fairy-tale fan), who asked, “Is that a game from Disney?” When I replied in the negative, she said, “But they’re trying to do Disney, right?”</p>
<p>They are indeed. From the opening frames, where drops of dew in an enchanted forest drop on the tummy of an enchanted ladybug, to the scene a few seconds later in which lovely Princess Rosella sings her royal heart out in a tuneful paean to her about-to-be-lost adolescence, King’s Quest VII exudes Disney-like quality from each of its cel-animated poses.</p>
<p>Every frame is beautiful, every line is neat and pert, the camera soars and glides, and the notes of the musical score tinkle out in bounding effervescence like the fizz out of a bottle of soda pop. This is the Disney of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin, if you deduct that film’s adult-targeted sense of irony. It’s the Disney of The Sword in the Stone and of Alice in Wonderland, light and fluffy as a soufflé. It’s not the Disney of Bambi or Snow White; here even the menaces are adorable bits of whimsy. If the villains ever frighten, it’s only for a brief time, and then everyone gets together again for one more song.</p>
<p>It matters not at all that the game is from Sierra rather than Disney. It is true to the Disney spirit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with the mouth-watering new look, the game showed some welcome design evolution over Robera Williams’s earlier work. Four years after LucasArts’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/03/monkey-island-or-how-ron-gilbert-made-an-adventure-game-that-didnt-suck"><em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em></a> had pointed the way, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> finally managed to free itself from the countless hidden dead ends that had always made playing a Roberta Williams game feel like playing make-believe with a sadist. Player deaths, on the other hand, were still copious, and still so unclued as to be essentially random, but were now at least relatively painless. Rather than expecting you to save every five minutes, the game was now kind enough to return you to the point you were at before you were so foolish as to look at the wrong thing or dilly-dally in the wrong room a second too long. In fact, save files as such disappeared altogether; exiting the game now automatically bookmarked your progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/727675-roberta-williams-king-s-quest-vii-the-princeless-bride-dos/" rel="attachment wp-att-4761"></a></p>
<p>These changes all existed in the name of making the game more welcoming to brand new players, out of the hope that they could be convinced to give it a try despite the ominous Roman numeral after its name. To further emphasize that this was a kinder, gentler <em>King’s Quest</em>, it used a radically simplified interface built around a one-click-does-it-all mouse cursor. More oddly, Sierra made it possible to play any of its chapters at any time, meaning you could start with the climax and work backward to the prologue if you were so inclined. (The real point of this feature, of course, was to let you watch each chapter’s opening movie without having to get your hands dirty with the actual game, if you happened to be one of the many people who typically bought each new <em>King’s Quest</em> as a tech demo for their latest computer.)</p>
<p>But alas, in other ways this latest entry really was just another <em>King’s Quest</em>. The writing from Roberta Williams and Lorelei Shannon, her latest apprentice co-designer, was the usual scattershot blend of fairy-tale and pop-culture ephmera, lacking sufficient wit or imagination to be all that compelling even as pastiche, while the puzzle design was made less infuriating than usual only by the lack of dead-player-walking situations. Both the writing and the puzzles got noticeably worse as the game wore on, evidence perhaps of a lead designer who was feeling increasingly bored with her big series, and was in fact already working on her next, very different game. All of this was doubly disappointing coming on the heels of <em>King’s Quest VI</em>, a game which had seemed to herald a series that was at last beginning to take its craft a bit more seriously. Even the much-vaunted look of <em>King’s Quest VII</em>, although impressive in its individual parts, made for a rather discordant jumble when taken in the aggregate, being the work of so many different teams of animators.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> sold very well upon its release in November of 1994, as games in the series always did. Meanwhile Dynamix, the most consistent of Sierra’s subsidiary studios, delivered solid performers in the non-adventure games <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/aces-of-the-deep"><em>Aces of the Deep</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/front-page-sports-football-pro-95"><em>Front Page Sports: Football ‘Pro 95</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/metaltech-earthsiege"><em>Metaltech: EarthSiege</em></a>. Most of all, though, it was the ImagiNation windfall that turned what would otherwise have been an ugly year into one that actually looked pretty good on the bottom line: $83.4 million in revenues, up from $59.5 million in 1993, with an accompanying $12 million profit, in contrast to an $8.6 million loss the previous year. Now it was up to the new product strategy to keep the party going in 1995.</p>
<p>The first big test of that strategy was to be the game that Roberta Williams had been working on concurrently with <em>King’s Quest VII</em>. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> would take full advantage of the Oakhurst sound stage Sierra had just built. It was to be a play against type worthy of any pop diva: Roberta, the family-friendly “queen of adventure gaming,” was going <em>dark</em> <em>and</em> <em>sexy</em>. “With <em>Phantasmagoria</em>,” wrote Sierra’s marketers, “Roberta Williams has created a superbly written interactive story, fraught with horror and suspense, and totally in the player’s control at all times.” Bill Crow, the mastermind of Sierra’s new sound stage, believed that “<em>Phantasmagoria</em> is going to open the market to a much broader audience of game players. We’re now starting to deliver an audiovisual experience that’s much closer to what the average consumer can relate to.” With <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, in other words, computer games were about to burst out of their nerdy ghetto to become sophisticated entertainments for discerning adults.</p>
<p>How times do change. Today <em>Phantasmagoria</em> is more or less a laughingstock, a tidy microcosm of everything that was wrong with the full-motion-video era of adventure games. In truth, some of its bad rap is a bit exaggerated; it’s not really any worse than dozens of other similarly dated productions of the mid-1990s. Certainly plenty of other games had equally cheesy acting, equally clueless writing, and equally trivial gameplay. <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s modern reputation for hilarious ineptitude stems to a large extent from its mainstream prominence in its heyday. The wave of hype that Sierra unleashed, much of it issuing from the mouth of Roberta herself, is catnip for snarky reviewers like yours truly, who can’t help but throw it all back in her face. “I want to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions,” Roberta said. But <em>Phantasmagoria</em> is so very, very much not that kind of game. If you squint just right, you can see what she was trying to create: a game of claustrophobic psychological horror, an interactive version of <em>The Shining</em>. But alas, nobody involved had the chops to pull it off.</p>
<p><em>Phantasmagoria</em> revolves around a couple of artsy newlyweds named Adrienne and Don, a novelist and a photographer respectively. As the story begins, they’ve just moved into a rambling old mansion on a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of New England. They’re the first people to attempt to live in the house, we soon learn, in almost a century. The last person to do so before them was a strange stage magician named Carno the Magnificent, who went through pretty young wives at a prodigious rate — all of them abruptly disappearing from the island, never to be seen again. In the end, Carno himself disappeared, and that was that for the house until our heroes turn up. It comes as a surprise to absolutely no one except them when the place turns out to be haunted by a malevolent spirit. It quickly begins to take over the mind of Don, leaving Adrienne, the character the player controls, to try to sort out the mystery before her husband murders her like Carno killed all of his wives.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly in light of Sierra’s mass-market aspirations, they never attempted to hire “name” actors for <em>Phantasmagoria</em> in the way that Origin Systems was <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/03/wing-commander-iii">doing at the time for the <em>Wing Commander</em> franchise</a>. The role of Adrienne went to Victoria Morsell, whom Sierra rather ambitiously described as a “film, TV, and theater star,” having apparently confused bit parts with starring ones. Still, she does a decent job within the awkward constraints of her task. David Homb in the role of Don, on the other hand, is just awful; his wooden performance comes off as more creepy before the horror starts, when he’s trying to play a loving husband and failing at it abjectly, than it does after his head starts metaphorically spinning around. The rest of the cast is a similarly mixed bag.</p>
<p>Sierra hired a director named Peter Maris, with a long run of schlocky ultra-low-budget films behind him, for a shoot that wound up taking fully four months. Even given that his oeuvre wasn’t exactly of Oscar caliber, his complete disregard for pacing is bizarre. <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s seven CDs — yes, <em>seven</em> — are filled with interminable sequences where Adrienne disassembles a brick chimney piece by piece, or breaks through a wooden door board by board, or applies her morning makeup layer by agonizing layer. Indeed, Adrienne insists on stopping and preening herself at each of the many mirrors in the house throughout the game, and we’re forced to watch and wait while she does so, hoping against hope that something interesting might happen this around. (For all of Roberta Williams’s status as a female pioneer in a male-dominated industry, her games’ view of gender isn’t always the most progressive.) All of this, combined with the clumsy, overly wordy script, makes the game seem much longer than the few hours it actually takes to play. There’s a (bad) 90-minute horror flick worth of plot-advancing footage here at the best; Sierra could easily have ditched three of the seven CDs without losing much at all.</p>
<p>The much-vaunted “adult” content is rather less than it’s cracked up to be. The opening movie includes the least sexy sex scene in the history of media. Ken Williams says that it was originally to have shown Adrienne topless, but Sierra lost their nerve in the end: “When it came time to release the game, we edited it to only show some side boob.” Given how weird and awkward it already is, we can only be thankful for their last-minute fit of prudishness.</p>
<p>Nor is the game remotely scary, although it does get gruesome — a very different quality — from time to time. These sequences come when Adrienne is visited by visions of the murders that took place long ago in the different rooms of the house, or, in the latter stages of the game, when she herself meets an unfortunate end thanks to a failure on the player’s part. For better or for worse, the methods of murder might just be the most creatively inspired parts of the game: Carno kills one wife by sticking a funnel into her mouth and stuffing disgusting offal down her throat, another by shackling her into a machine that twists her head around until her neck snaps, while Adrienne can get her head sliced in two by an axe blade or her face literally ripped off by a demon. These scenes are certainly gross and shocking in their way, but it’s all strictly B-movie-slasher fare rather than the <em>Shining</em> vibe Roberta was going for.</p>
<p>The scene which prompts by far the most discussion today takes place out of the blue one morning, when Don creeps up behind Adrienne at her bedroom mirror and proceeds to… well, to rape her. Needless to say, this is a disturbing place for even an adults-only game to go. Roberta Williams is hopelessly out of her writerly depth here; in contemporary interviews, she seems utterly oblivious to the real trauma of rape, describing the scene as nothing more than a plot device to show Don’s descent into evil. Its one saving grace is the fact that no one involved is up to the task of making the rape seem remotely realistic; Don humps and thrusts a bit without ever actually taking his boxer shorts off, and that’s that. (One can only hope that Sierra didn’t shoot a more explicit version of this scene…) Afterward Adrienne, rather in contrast to Roberta’s stated desire to explore “deep emotions,” just cleans herself up and gets on with her day, apparently none the worse for wear. Even amidst the more lackadaisical sexual politics of 1995, the scene prompted considerable discussion and a measure of public outrage here and there. Australia’s Office of Film and Literature Classification refused to accept the game because of it, with the result that it was effectively banned from sale in that country.</p>
<p>So much for <em>Phantasmagoria</em> the movie. In terms of gameplay, it isn’t up to all that much at all. Its reliance on canned snippets of static video dramatically limits the scope of its interactivity, while its determination to be as accessible as possible means that all of its puzzles are broadly obvious; a version of that tired old adventure saw, the locked door with a key in the keyhole on the other side and a handy nail and newspaper, is about as complicated as things ever get. The simplified interface from <em>King’s Quest VII</em> makes a return, it’s once again possible to play the chapters in any order you choose, and bookmarks once more replace save files in the game’s terminology, although it is at least possible to make your own bookmarks whenever you like now.</p>
<p>In a way, all of this is a blessing: it lets you power right on through <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, laughing at it all the while, without getting hung up on the design flaws that dog most of Roberta Williams’s games. I’m not generally a fan of high camp, but even I could probably enjoy <em>Phantasmagoria</em> with the right group of friends. If ever a game was ripe for the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> treatment, it’s this one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Every article was sure to mention the game’s budget of fully $4 million, an absolutely astronomical sum by the standards of the time, and one which Sierra too trumpeted for all it was worth in their advertising. In truth, much of that money had gone into the building of the Oakhurst sound stage that Sierra planned to use for many more games, but no one was going to let such details get in the way of a headline about a $4 million computer game. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> became a massive hit; its sales soared past the magic mark of 1 million units and just kept right on going. It was a perfect game to take home with a shiny new computer, the perfect way to show your friends and neighbors what your new wundermachine could do. The window of time in which a game like this could have success on a scale like this was to prove sharply limited, but <em>Phantasmagoria</em> managed to slip through behind <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-full-motion-video-consulting-detective"><em>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective</em></a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/04/the-7th-guests-new-clothes"><em>The 7th Guest</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success"><em>Myst</em></a> just before said window slammed shut. It would prove the last such sparkling success among its peculiar species of game.</p>
<p>But what a success it was while it lasted. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> still stands as the best-selling game ever released by an independent Sierra. Small wonder that Ken and Roberta Williams both remember it so fondly today. Rather than a laughingstock, they remember <em>Phantasmagoria</em> as a mainstream-press darling and chart-topping hit, and love it for that. Thus Ken continues to describe it as “awesome,” while Roberta still names it as her favorite of all the games she made. It was all too easy in 1995 to believe that <em>Phantasmagoria</em> really was the future of gaming writ large.</p>
<p>The Oakhurst folks finished three other adventure games that year, with more mixed commercial results. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-quest-6-roger-wilco-in-the-spinal-frontier"><em>Space Quest 6</em></a>, which was made with a lot of the traditional Sierra style but without a lot of enthusiasm from upper management, validated the latter’s skepticism when it failed to sell all that well, signifying the end of that series. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/torins-passage"><em>Torin’s Passage</em></a>, a workmanlike fantasy adventure in the <em>King’s Quest</em> mold by Al Lowe of <em>Leisure Suit Larry</em> fame, was another mediocre performer, one whose reason for existing at all at this juncture was a little hard to determine. Finally, the second of the new generation of Sierra adventures, built like <em>Phantasmagoria </em>around filmed actors, was <em>The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery</em>. I’ll return to it in my next article.</p>
<p>Yet Oakhurst was no longer the be all, end all of Sierra. In the new corporate order envisioned by Ken Williams and Mike Brochu, the adventure games that came out of Oakhurst were to be only a single piece of the overall Sierra puzzle. They planned to build an empire from Bellevue that would cover all of the bases in consumer-oriented software. Already over the course of the previous half-decade, Sierra had acquired the Oregon-based jack-of-all-trades games studio Dynamix, the Delaware-based educational-software specialist Bright Star, and the artsy French games studio Coktel Visions. Now, in the first year after Brochu’s hiring, they made no fewer than six more significant acquisitions: the Texas-based Arion Software, maker of the recipe-tracking package MasterCook; the Washington-based Green Thumb Software, maker of Land Designer and other tools for gardeners; the British Impressions Software, maker of a diverse lineup of strategy games; the Massachusetts-based Papyrus Design Group, a specialist in auto-racing simulations; the Washington-based Pixellite Group, the maker of Print Artist, a software package for creating signs and banners; and the Utah-based Headgate Studios, a specialist in golf simulations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/238070-trophy-bass-windows-front-cover/" rel="attachment wp-att-4759"></a></p>
<p>Of all the other products Sierra released in 1995, the one that came closest to matching <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s success came from good old reliable Dynamix. “I was in a high-level meeting,” remembers Dynamix’s founder Jeff Tunnell, “and the sales manager for all of Sierra said, ‘These fishing games are selling in Japan on the Nintendo.’ Everybody started laughing. But I said, ‘I’ll do one.&#39;” Like <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/trophy-bass"><em>Trophy Bass</em></a> was consciously designed for a different demographic than the typical computer game; it looked more at home on the shelves of Walmart than Electronics Boutique or Software Etc. It shocked everybody by outselling all other Sierra games in 1995, with the exception only of Roberta Williams’s big adventure, becoming in the process the best-selling game that Dynamix ever had or ever would make. Thanks to it, the later 1990s would see a flood of other fishing and hunting games, most of them executed with less love than <em>Trophy Bass</em>. Hardcore computers gamers scoffed at these simplistic knockoff titles and the supposed simple-minded rednecks who played them, but they sold and sold and sold.</p>
<p>Along with <em>Phantasmagoria</em> and other Sierra products like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/the-incredible-machine"><em>The Incredible Machine</em></a>, <em>Trophy Bass</em> provided proof positive that there were any number of new customer bases out there just waiting to be tapped, made up of people who were looking for something a bit less demanding of their time and energy than the typical computer game for the hardcore, with themes other than the nerdy staples of science fiction, fantasy, and military simulations. Whatever his faults and mistakes — you know, those ones which I haven’t hesitated to describe at copious length in these articles — Ken Williams realized earlier than most that these people were out there, and never stopped trying to reach them, even as he also navigated the computer-game market as it was currently constituted. For this, he deserves enormous credit.</p>
<p>As Sierra came out of 1995, he had good reason to feel pleased with himself. Revenues had nearly doubled over those of the previous year, to $158.1 million, and even all of the acquisitions couldn’t prevent the company from clearing over $16 million in profits. With Electronic Arts, the only publisher of consumer software with equal size and clout, now investing more and more heavily in console games, Sierra seemed to stand on the verge of complete dominance of the exploding marketplace for home-computer software. Ken’s longstanding dream of selling software to <em>everyone</em> was so close to fruition that he could taste it. And as for Roberta: her own dream of becoming the Steven Spielberg of interactivity seemed less and less far-fetched each day.</p>
<p>If you had told the pair that Roberta would never get the chance to make another point-and-click adventure game, or that the Oakhurst sound stage would be written off as a colossal blind alley and decommissioned within the next few years, or that neither of them would still be working for Sierra by that point, or that Sierra’s Oakhurst branch as a whole would be shuttered well before the millennium… well, they would presumably have been surprised, to say the least.</p>

<p>Nothing anyone says on Clubhouse matters. The whole point of Clubhouse is to be seen. It doesn’t matter who speaks or what they say. It matters that they are seen as high status people.</p>



<p>Clubhouse rose to prominence when no one could be seen in person. Everyone was stuck in their homes. Someone with a high reputation, credibility, or value to a group couldn’t flex their status in person. They couldn’t brag in person about the work they were doing, signal how smart they were, or tell you about their role at some cool company. Clubhouse was a way to be seen with other high status people, especially in circles like tech and crypto.</p>



<p>Now that high status people can be seen in person again, they are spending less time on Clubhouse. Lower status people are left trying to be seen amongst themselves. Without high status people, Clubhouse is not serving its purpose of helping people be seen. It is a cargo cult: low status people recreating the actions of high status people, after they have left, thinking it will cause them to be high status.</p>



<h2><strong>The Relics Left Behind</strong></h2>



<p>The relics of the status games are in the design. Even before you enter a room, Clubhouse shows you the people you follow in it. A user can judge the status of a room based on its size, the status of the speakers, and the status of any people they follow. High status people are often the most followed so they guide the discovery. Without these people, discovery is gamed and less relevant.</p>



<p>Each room has status games being played within it as well. If you look at other live social apps, audiences generally do something like chat or react. On Clubhouse, anyone not talking has nothing to do except listen and look at other members of the room. When you look at the screen, you’ll see every room is a hierarchy. The important people on top, their support in the middle, and the audience on the bottom.</p>



<p>The important people are on stage. It is the highest form of being seen. In big rooms, if you are on stage, everyone’s attention is on you, even if you aren’t speaking. These people literally are at the top and take up the most space, having the largest avatars only three to a row. Their status increases by being there with high status people. This is the ultimate goal of a status-seeking Clubhouse user.</p>



<p>The next level of the hierarchy is the status support group. It is a designated zone for the group of people who the speakers follow. If high status people are here, it means the people on stage must be very high status. They provide extra credibility for those on stage and help the room get discovered by more people.</p>



<p>For example, a startup founder is speaking in a room and a prominent venture capitalist is in the audience. If that VC knows the company, there isn’t any new information going to be shared, but there is status to doing it. It is beneficial to the status of both the speaker (founder) and the status support member (VC) to be there. The venture capitalist’s authority rubs off on the speakers, making them seem more legitimate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The lowest in the hierarchy is the audience. These people are so far down the hierarchy they are rarely ever seen in large rooms. Anyone who wants to be seen and gain status should try to leave this area. People are here because they are truly interested in the conversation or are trying to move up the hierarchy so they can gain status. Low status audience members rarely get a chance to engage in big rooms. They are status fodder for people up the hierarchy.</p>



<h2><strong>Fighting to Be the Place to Be Seen</strong></h2>



<p>Now that the high status people are mostly gone, lower status people fill all levels and try to recreate the dynamics. The design of Clubhouse is still the same. People try to be seen on stage in popular rooms. Organizers try to optimize their room to be recommended. Users fill their bio with interests and topics they care about. All of this is diluted because the people with status aren’t there anymore. The status and recognition people want is not there.</p>



<p>There are fewer “must-listen” rooms with massive audiences. Rooms are smaller and driven by interests or topics, rather than the people involved. The recommendation algorithm, which is driven by people you follow, is less relevant. Following lists are increasingly filled with low status people who are active on Clubhouse rather than high status people from the real world. The exclusivity from launching as invite and iPhone only is wearing off now that anyone can join including Android users. Clubhouse is not the high status place to be seen anymore.</p>



<p>A way to illustrate this is the decline in fear of missing out on Clubhouse. Few people think they are missing anything by not being there. Compared to its peak when people were buying invites, sending them to their closest friends, spending hours on the platform, and talking about it on social media, Clubhouse doesn’t have the same magic it once did.</p>



<p>High status people can now be seen together in exclusive places in real life. In person parties and events are impossible to compete with. It also doesn’t help that Clubhouse is being copied by seemingly every other big tech company. Everyone wants to recreate the magic Clubhouse had.</p>



<p>Can Clubhouse ever recreate the magic of being a high status place to be seen? They can try. For every category of people, not only in tech and crypto, they must become “the place” to be seen with other high status people. High status people must want to flex their status and share it with others on the platform. If this happened, the low status cargo cult members would gain the status boost they’re looking for.</p>



<p>The other option is to embrace the lower status people. Many interesting rooms and behaviours are happening outside the big ones. Recent releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576771/clubhouse-dm-backchannel-update-message">messaging</a> give hints they are moving away from only being a “place to be seen.” The app has the potential to be the mass audio social network. This was likely the plan all along, and they had a lucky break with the “place to be seen” diversion.</p>



<p>Either way, people always want to be seen. Clubhouse, for a moment, captured that need. To succeed as once thought, they need to do it again at a larger scale or embrace the behaviours of lower status people. If not, the cargo cult of Clubhouse will continue.</p>

<p>tl; dr – I hypothesize the physical and emotional distance of ticketing systems reduces job satisfaction and propose solutions.</p>







<p>Bear with me.</p>



<p>I remember when I was a kid I knew how to code. I didn’t get as good grades as I could have, I didn’t shine in a few other ways, but despite this I knew I could do something special. I could build interesting things and I could fix problems.</p>



<p>When it came to my first job I felt the same way. At the time I’d say I was still a bit “rough around the edges” but I could fix problems, sometimes hard ones, and that made me useful. It felt great to be needed using the one way I knew I was good at. There was nothing like somebody walking over to my desk to tell me about a problem that was making their lives hard, and to be able to fix it for them.</p>



<p>Pretty soon though a number of more senior engineers started speaking up. “We can’t have interruptions like this. We need to be more structured. We need to track this work. We need to put to asks in JIRA.” I had the same reaction a lot of people do, which was “Why do we need to track this? Do we not trust everybody is working to the best of their ability?”. I got the usual answers about the importance of estimation, planning, etc, and didn’t entirely understand, but accepted.</p>



<p>Years later, senior myself, I would insist – <em>every code change must have an associated ticket</em>. That isn’t to say I’m some kind of agile evangelist, but I certainly found ticketing systems indispensable, even for the smallest of teams. Somewhere along the way I had forgotten that I had ever felt otherwise.</p>



<p>Next role I became the main SRE for a chaotic startup. Some people would hate it, but I <em>loved</em> it. The buzz and thrill and of a war-room was incomparable to the transactional feature development that would eventually lead to an A/B release that would then possibly lead to a small % improvement in a metric. I loved fixing things for other engineers who I saw in person, who were happy and impressed that I would fix their issue and improved the whole system to make the issue impossible in the future.</p>



<p>What I loved wasn’t inherent to being an SRE itself. Though a high-stakes role, it can also be as isolating as any role. It can be waking up to an alarm at night to login in by oneself and fix an issue, file a ticket, and have nobody notice.</p>



<p><strong>What I loved was face-to-face interaction and a shared emotional narrative. </strong></p>



<p><strong>From another angle </strong>– when I go to whole foods and watch the cashier scan my overpriced items, I wonder what they think. Though small talk with strangers is far from a strength for me, I struggle anyways to connect in whatever small way I can. I don’t think I could force a joke and trust the timing to line up with the variable checkout time. I try to be nice without being stiffly polite. It may mean bagging my own groceries, or avoiding the instinct to stare at my phone. I can’t even say for sure that cashiers notice or like it. <strong>I simply presume that if I were in their shoes I wouldn’t want to feel like a machine.</strong></p>



<h2>The Answer</h2>



<p>Well first, the question: How do we reconcile our desire to feel individually noticed and human with the business needs of standardization? I think this question is the most important piece of this article. I’ll make a proposal or two, to get the ball rolling, but the topic is wide-open.</p>



<ul><li>What if tickets are filed normally through jira, but then the filer must also come over to the desk of the person operating on the ticket and explain the issue face-to-face?</li><li>What if tickets are described in a way that stresses the emotional importance to the user of the feature?</li><li>What if end-user satisfaction and wishes, as captured by PMs who communicate with users, was shared with engineers?</li></ul>



<p>How would you achieve it?</p>

<h2>The price of .com at Gandi</h2>
<p>Therefore, we’ll be carrying over this price increase in our pricing grid. You can find the new prices for new domain creations, renewals, transfers, and restorations of <strong>.com</strong> domain names <strong>starting August 31, 2021 at 9:00 PM Pacific</strong> (September 1, 2021 at 4:00 UTC) in Grid A.</p>
<p><strong>.com </strong><a href="https://www.gandi.net/en-us/domain/tld/com">https://www.gandi.net/en-us/domain/tld/com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Create: <span><strong>$16.59* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$15.50<span>*</span></strong>)</li>
<li>Renewal: <span><strong>$16.59* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$15.50<span>*</span></strong>)</li>

<li>Restore: <span><strong>$139.10* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$130.00<span>*</span></strong>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>More price increases to come on .com?</h2>
<p>The domain name industry may see further price increases in <strong>.com</strong> domains in the coming years: besides this year’s price increase, Verisign has been permitted to increase .com prices up to 7% in 2022 and 2023 as well as between 2026 to 2029.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to renew your domain names for the maximum renewal period <strong>before August 31, 2021</strong> in order to benefit from the current price for the longest time frame.</p>
<p>If you’ve registered your domain name for 1 year, you can renew it for an additional 9 years.</p>

Mario Tama, via Getty.</figcaption></figure></div><p> <em>Edited by Sam Thielman </em></p><p><strong>DESPITE THE REDACTIONS</strong>, the pseudonyms, and the thousands of unreleased pages, the Senate intelligence committee’s report into post-9/11 CIA torture – that is, <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">the executive summary available to the public</a> – is the most robust oversight ever conducted of any part of the War on Terror. The committee typically defends the agencies and activities it nominally oversees; remarkably, the torture investigation revealed the gruesome realities inside the CIA’s black sites. It demonstrated, with precision and rigor, how the CIA constructed a Big Lie, called “Enhanced Interrogation,” around its barbarism. </p><p>But the committee’s lead investigator says that he could only investigate two of the three components of the torture program. The third is lost to history. </p><p><strong>THE CIA CALLED THE PROGRAM RDI</strong>, for <em>Renditions, Detentions and Interrogations</em>. “Renditions” are outsourced torture: the CIA abducts someone and sends them to be abused either by their home country’s security apparatus; or, in the “extraordinary rendition” variant, by a third country’s security apparatus. “Detentions” were the maintenance, logistics and direct operations of the black sites where the CIA, not an allied intelligence service, imprisoned people. “Interrogations” were the torture the CIA inflicted. </p><p>Renditions were the kernel of the program. They were the only aspect of CIA torture in operation on 9/11. The entity within the CIA Counterterrorism Center that conducted it, the Renditions Group, expanded after 9/11 to become the RDI Group, or “<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-113srpt288/pdf/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">RDG</a>.” One of the people involved in the Renditions Group from inception, Mike Scheuer, explained many years ago in an underappreciated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdb5nnRMrU">video</a>, “After 9/11, the CIA was the only game in town. The Bush White House pushed on the CIA to accelerate the rendition program.” (Scheuer has been on a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-scheuer-hunted-bin-laden-for-cia-now-he-wants-americans-dead">journey</a>.) </p><p>Yet we know vastly more about the <em>D</em> and the <em>I</em> than we know about the <em>R</em>. The Senate’s investigation solely concerned the CIA’s detentions and interrogations. Over the six years of the investigation, the CIA fought aggressively to restrict even that constrained mandate. It was not going to allow Senate investigators to <em>expand</em> their remit, according to Daniel J. Jones, the lead investigator. “<em>Everything</em> was a heavy lift,” Jones remembers.</p><p>And even if the agency somehow <em>had</em> allowed him to investigate renditions, Jones’ experience of digging through deliberately confusing and incomplete records that the CIA provided – and sometimes subsequently disappeared – leads him to the conclusion that the agency’s own renditions records are likely far from extensive. </p><p>“The [CIA’s detention and interrogation] records in 2002 are detailed. As the ‘DI’ program went on, we saw less and less robust record-keeping,” Jones recalls. “One could imagine that also applied to rendition.” </p><p>All three components of the program were tied together, and so occasionally Jones saw glimpses; suggestions and clues to what rendition was. But not only was rendition beyond the scope of his investigation, he already had to contend with the maddening and painstaking work of figuring out who was and was not in CIA custody, then figuring out how meaningful such distinctions were when it came both to internal classifications and the actual treatment of human beings. It was arduous.</p><p>Officially speaking, the Senate was able to tally <em>at least</em> 119 people whom the CIA held in the black sites during their 2002-2008 existence. “There’s a back-and-forth we had with the agency on who was a CIA detainee and who wasn’t. The committee, to arrive at 119, is extremely conservative. Everyone who was involved in this investigation believes there was more than 119 CIA detainees,” Jones explained. </p><p>“If the CIA doesn’t know how many people were in its own custody, it’s very unlikely there’s any record-keeping of people who were merely <em>transients</em>” – that is, briefly in CIA custody before being whisked to a partner intelligence service – “and those who <em>weren’t </em>in their custody. ...Tenet and every other [CIA] director said [the torture program] was the CIA’s central counterterrorism program at the time. Because it was a central program – and incredibly sensitive – it would be reasonable to think the CIA would maintain a robust classified record,” he continued. </p><p>“If, in fact, the ‘DI’ part was viewed as the central component of the War on Terror by the CIA, there’s no reason to believe they would hold better records with the rendition program.”</p><p><strong>TWO BROAD FACTS ABOUT CIA TORTURE</strong> make Jones’s supposition especially compelling.</p><p>First, the only reason the Senate intelligence committee investigated at all is that two leading figures inside the program, Jose Rodriguez and Gina Haspel, destroyed videotapes of the torture of two men inside the first post-9/11 black site – something that also sparked a <em>criminal</em> investigation. Once the Senate learned about the destruction of those tapes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html">from </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html">The New York Times</a></em>, rather than from the CIA, the committee could no longer credibly refuse to open an investigation of its own. </p><p>Second, in most major speeches and testimony, CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss, and Michael Hayden repeatedly emphasized that their War on Terror is an international team sport. They did this so often that journalists rarely bothered quoting it; it seemed like boilerplate. It was often self-serving, as when they cited the importance of cooperation with allied intelligence services as a reason to never disclose what that cooperation <em>did</em>. But they’re correct that reliance on various <em>Mukhabarats</em> makes their war viable. “I cannot overstate how vital these relationships are to our overall effort,” Hayden <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-michael-v-hayden-0">said</a> in one <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?200866-1/combatting-terrorism">typical September 2007</a> appearance.</p><p>The absence of renditions records, even to the Senate torture report, is no longer exactly <em>news</em>. I reported it in 2016 in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/cia-insider-daniel-jones-senate-torture-investigation">20,000-plus-word, three-part series for </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/cia-insider-daniel-jones-senate-torture-investigation">The Guardian</a></em>. But what has bothered me ever since is how little attention and care that absence has ever received. In the wake of our <a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">recent </a><em><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">Forever Wars </a></em><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">piece about naming the dead</a>, I’ve been thinking about that more and more – the enormous gap in our historical knowledge of renditions; the likelihood that if the Senate torture report couldn’t go there, then we’re probably <em>not going</em> to fill those gaps; and the fact that pretty much no one gives a shit. </p><p>The awful conclusion is that disappearances work. </p><p><strong>WE KNOW </strong><em><strong>SOME </strong></em><strong>THINGS ABOUT RENDITIONS.</strong> In particular, we know that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees">the CIA took bondage nudes</a> of bound prisoners at the point of transferring them. <em>That</em> was documentation of the renditions – presumably made to provide proof that someone who might ultimately die in a foreign torture chamber was alive when the CIA had them. </p><p>Human Rights Watch, in 2008, was able to document 14 people the CIA rendered to the Jordanians. One of them, Abu Hamza al-Tabuki, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/04/07/double-jeopardy/cia-renditions-jordan#">recalled</a>: “from the first day, they began to interrogate me using the methods of terror and fear, torture and beating, insults and verbal abuse, and threatening to expose my private parts <em>and rape me</em>. I was repeatedly beaten, and insulted, along with my parents and family.” Those familiar with the history of torture, particularly in a context of war, will note how present <em>sexual </em>torture is within it. </p><p>When the U.S. helped overthrow Moammar Qaddafi in 2011, it inadvertently led to the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/triploidocs_appendix1.pdf">publication</a> of the files locked in the offices of Qaddafi’s internal-security apparatus. That ended up accidentally exposing what CIA-Libya cooperation looked like in practice. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/helping-gadhafi-torture/">It’s really not a pleasant read</a>. Neither is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/egyptian-cleric-defends-cia-agent-convicted-rendition-abu-omar">messy history</a> of the rendition of Abu Omar, whom the CIA abducted in Milan <em>after</em> Italy had granted him asylum. </p><p>In my 2016 <em>Guardian</em> piece, I reported that renditions were the “largest” part of RDI. Jones reminds me, helpfully, that “we don’t really actually know that.” </p><p>Fair enough. I was using a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-6-2007-0032_EN.html?redirect">European Parliament investigation from 2007</a> that reported: “at least <em>1,245 flights</em> operated by the CIA flew into European airspace or stopped over at European airports between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005, to which should be added an unspecified number of military flights for the same purpose; ...on one hand, there may have been more CIA flights than those confirmed by the investigations carried out by the Temporary Committee, while, on the other, not all those flights have been used for extraordinary rendition.” </p><p>Note that last line. Note how the EU acknowledges the limits of its investigative visibility into European complicity. The EU investigators are able to document over 1,200 CIA flights to Europe over four years. They can’t say each flight was a renditions ferry, or that each flight equals a person rendered. They <em>can</em> say they are unable to answer the question, and as a fallback, offer their best evidence as a proxy for the scale of a program whose surface they can barely scratch, thanks to the obstinacy of several governments. </p><p>Hayden, in 2007, weaponized that uncertainty to discredit the EU. “The suggestion that even a substantial number of those 1,245 flights were carrying detainees is frankly absurd on its face,” he <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-michael-v-hayden-0">scoffed</a>.</p><p>Except it’s not absurd at all. It is true that Hayden had exclusive access to whatever remained of the CIA record, so he could make assertions about the CIA torture program being “designed only for the most dangerous terrorists and those believed to have the most valuable information, such as knowledge of planned attacks” from a position of authority.</p><p>Unfortunately for Hayden, Scheuer, who said he “ran renditions” when he was at the Counterterrorism Center, accidentally contradicted him in 2008. </p><p>“Under Mr. Clinton we had focused on very senior al-Qaeda people,” Scheuer (who didn’t respond to a message seeking comment) recalled at an event at Berkeley that year. After 9/11, he told the audience, “the bar went down a little bit, and we began to pick other people up.” (This is around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdb5nnRMrU">minute 32:30 in this video</a>.) </p><p>Defenders of rendition, Hayden included, tend to describe rendition as lawful, complete with guarantees from other nations of humane treatment. Scheuer is a rare CIA official who acknowledges on record that that’s bullshit. “Under Mr. Clinton, we were to take them off the street and arrange for them to be returned to a government that wanted them for a judicial process,” he said at that event. </p><blockquote><p>We went back to the White House and said, “This was what we planned to do, do you want us to do it?” Yes, was the answer. “Well, we’re going to take them to countries where they’re wanted, but your State Department, every year, is going to say ‘that country is a human rights abuser,’ or its judicial processes are not what we want them to be.” And everybody kind of puckered up and said, “Ooh, that may be a problem. Can you get these countries to say ‘We will treat these rendered people according to our own laws?’” And we said, “Yeah, we’re pretty sure that country X will treat them according [to their own laws] – that won’t get you off the hook!” But that’s as far as it went. Now, President Clinton and [national security adviser Sandy] Berger said that they insisted on guarantees that these prisoners would be treated according to American standards or international law. Now, I was there. I ran the operations. That was never a requirement that I knew of. That&#39;s entirely a kind of after-the-fact defense of what was done.</p></blockquote><p>Hayden has a track record of lying. When Jones was able to examine the records of the CIA’s detentions and interrogations, he saw just how heavily Hayden and others in the CIA manipulated the truth. An entire annex of the Senate intelligence report debunks a fusillade of lies Hayden told about CIA torture <em>in just one day of testimony.</em> (Appendix 3, starting on <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">page 462 of the report.</a>) And that’s not the end of it: see <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/">Reign of Terror</a></em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/">, out on Tuesday</a>. (Also, I have a story about Hayden showing up at one of my band’s shows; I might write about that for subscribers, so please do subscribe.) </p><p>Scroll up in this piece to the quote from Jones about how there’s a “back-and-forth” over who the agency counts as detainees, prompting the Senate to act conservatively in tallying 119 men at the black sites. Hayden, in 2007, claimed the number of black-site prisoners was “fewer than 100.” All this is particularly glaring when reviewing Hayden’s assertion, in the same speech, that “the number of renditions is actually even a smaller number, mid-range two figures.” </p><p><strong>WHAT WE LACK</strong>, and what we will likely always lack, is a <em>systemic</em> understanding of the renditions, extraordinary and (<em>sighs</em>) “ordinary.” The Senate intelligence committee report emerged from a unique opportunity and set of historical circumstances. Neither will come again. Jones performed an extraordinary service for history. I don’t write any of this to fault <em>him</em> for being unable to unearth the rendition program – no one outside of the Church and Pike committees has done more to force <em>real</em> transparency out of the CIA. </p><p>“We had two options in a world of limited resources: to attempt to totally detail all the renditions; or to detail the ‘D and I’ in US custody,” Jones said. “It’s still the right call, but it makes the false assumption that Congress can only have the most minimal of investigative resources. In essence, we’ve decided to live in this world of limited oversight.” Damn. Sit with that quote a moment. </p><p>Jones is pointing to a consequence-free obliteration of truth. The mark on the victim’s body is torture’s true measurement, especially when we believe that every human being has inherent worth and dignity. The official denial that the mark was made, aggregated across an unknown number of people, is no longer a crime against them alone but a crime against history. One of the people directly involved in both the mark and the denial, <em>after both were known</em>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/she-should-be-in-jailrights-groups-rally-to-stop-torture-overseer-turned-trump-cia-pick-gina-haspel">rose to become CIA director</a>, to bipartisan acclaim. One of her <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-proxy-war-over-joe-biden-adviser-avril-haines">boosters</a> is, right now, the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence">Director of National Intelligence</a>. Another chairs the Senate intelligence committee. </p><p>“The oversight mechanisms and the executive branch have allowed both inappropriate and illegal behavior to happen without consequence,” said Jones. “There’s <em>never</em> any accountability. There is no leash. It’s just unclipped. In such a lax oversight environment, why would they think they need records?”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Emacs Lock-In Effect or the Emacs Sunk Cost Fallacy</title>

Update 2021-07-24: Reply/comment by Deep-Fox6860

</p>

<p>

This is an extended comment from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/opx6mb/sunk_cost_fallacy/">this original reddit thread</a> where <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Deep-Fox6860/">Deep-Fox6860</a> wrote:

</p>

<blockquote>Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had.</blockquote>

<p>

I think I understand what you&#39;re writing here and to some extend, I do agree.

</p>

<p>

However, <b>I would like to challenge the point of view</b> to this good philosophical question on tool choice with this article.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Property of Flexible Tools in General</h2></header>

<p>

Yes, Emacs is a platform that requires investment in time and knowledge to be mastered. But what you get is a system that is as flexible as possible to deal with present and future changes of requirements.

</p>

<p>

I can not think of a different situation where you are using a flexible tool that you adapt to your situation which does <b>not</b> come with the sunk cost fallacy or some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in effect</a>, how I call it in my <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/pim">PIM</a> lectures.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Openess and the Right Tool Choice Process</h2></header>

<p>

Another aspect is: everything within Emacs and org mode as a frequent use-case is open. So you&#39;re free to switch to a different tool. The positive side is that your problem is not &#34;getting all of your data out of Emacs&#34;. Your problem will be to find a more suitable tool which lets you import all this accumulated data or which is able to drive your processes and workflows.

</p>

<p>

In other words: In <b>any</b> situation where somebody finds a tool which fits to her/his set of requirements, working with it for a long time, adapting to the requirements step by step, generating data, managing information and knowledge, you will get to a point where switching to a different tool will cause you a high level of effort. This is nothing specific to Emacs in particular. In most cases, you will learn that you can&#39;t even get out all of your data any more. And here is where the openness of Emacs shines.

</p>

<p>

I&#39;ve written down my proposal on <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/2021/01/18/tool-choices">how people should choose their (software) tools</a>. If you followed this principle and your tool suits you well, you don&#39;t have to change to a different tool. (And if you do need to switch, following my tool choice process made sure that you are <b>able</b> to switch without data loss.)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Important Long-Term Aspects</h2></header>

<p>

<b>My personal opinion on Emacs is that I&#39;ll probably never switch to anything different in my life any more.</b> I learned to embrace its flexibility so that I can not think of many situations where Emacs does not provide me the features I need for my <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/pim">personal information management</a>. From this perspective, I do have a perfect lock-in situation which I usually try to avoid as much as possible. <b>This is the single lock-in situation I can think of that is a perfectly good thing to be in.</b>

</p>

<p>

Another aspect why I do not consider time investment in technology like Emacs is a bad thing: Emacs knowledge is <b>long-term knowledge</b>.

</p>

<p>

I did learn many things for proprietary tools over the last decades. A large percentage of this effort is now useless, making this past learning effort to a temporary one. Some knowledge got obsolete as fast as the next major release was published.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand side, whatever I&#39;ve learned for technologies like Emacs, LaTeX, GNU/Linux, and so forth in the nineties, is still valid and useful to me nowadays. This can not be stressed enough: instead of un-learning and re-learning, I was able to improve and learn new things. <b>This scales much better than any proprietary or temporary knowledge.</b>

</p>

	  <header><h2>Scheuklappen-Effekt (German for &#34;blinkers effect&#34;)</h2></header>

<p>

In German &#34;Scheuklappen-Effekt&#34; means that you have a narrowed view for some reason. I don&#39;t know if there is a similar phrase in the English language.

</p>

<p>

The difference between &#34;using Emacs for a long time and thinking less of other tools&#34; to the mentioned sunk cost fallacy situation may be that I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m using Emacs just because I don&#39;t think of alternatives any more. I use it because all in all, it&#39;s the best package I can get for now and most probably also for the future.

</p>

<p>

I&#39;m using many tools outside of Emacs which could be replaced by Emacs-modes/methods right away (<a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/emails">email</a>, web browsing, most of file management, ...). However, the openness of Emacs (and Org mode) allows me to work with Emacs and other tools in parallel, interfacing them smoothly so that I don&#39;t have much pain with these &#34;borders&#34;.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Reply by Deep-Fox6860</h2></header>

<p>

With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/opx6mb/sunk_cost_fallacy/h69esq0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this comment on reddit</a>, Deep-Fox6860 added interesting aspects:

</p>

<blockquote>Regarding the openness, I started with org because I was hooked on the
idea of having everything as simple text files and I thought I would
be able to leave in the future, if I want to. I mean, the exits are
well marked and still people choose to stay, it seems.</blockquote>

<p>

Here is my answer to that:

</p>

<p>

Your remark on the openness and ability to move away is really interesting. It seems to be the case that people might tend to stay with tools that makes them more easy to leave. If this assumption is true, it has a certain level of irony, hasn&#39;t it?

</p>

<p>

Flexibility as a bad thing? Of course! In my PIM lecture, I do have a section where I explain that there are (very simplified!) two categories of tools: simple tools and advanced tools. Both categories are perfectly valid for matching requirements. The issue is that people use simple tools when an advanced tool would provide them much more advantages in the long run. Likewise - and this is what you are referring to - when you choose an advanced tool like Emacs can be for requirements where a simple tool would be the better fit, you do have to face issues. The point is that <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/2021/01/18/tool-choices">we need to teach people to do deliberate and wise choices for tools</a> before they do face issues because of wrong tool choice or lock-in effects.

<p>In reading Yan Zhu’s excellent write-up of the <a href="https://blog.azuki.vip/csrf/">JSON CSRF vulnerability</a> she found in OkCupid one thing puzzled me: I was under the impression that browsers these days default to treating cookies as <code>SameSite=Lax</code>, so I would expect attacks like the one Yan described not to work in modern browsers.</p>
<p>This lead me down a rabbit hole of exploring how SameSite actually works, including building <a href="https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/">an interactive SameSite cookie exploration tool</a> along the way. Here’s what I learned.</p>
<h4>Background: Cross-Site Request Forgery</h4>
<p>I’ve been tracking CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/csrf/?page=2">on this blog</a> since 2005(!)</p>
<p>A quick review: let’s say you have a page in your application that allows a user to delete their account, at <code>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</code>. The user has to be signed in with a cookie in order to activate that feature.</p>
<p>If you created that page to respond to <code>GET</code> requests, I as an evil person could create a page at <code>https://www.evil.com/force-you-to-delete-your-account</code> that does this:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>img</span> <span>src</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>If I can get you to visit my page, I can force you to delete your account!</p>
<p>But you’re smarter than that, and you know that GET requests should be idempotent. You implement your endpoint to require a POST request instead.</p>
<p>Turns out I can still force-delete accounts, if I can trick a user into visiting a page with the following evil HTML on it:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span> <span>action</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</span>&#34; <span>method</span>=&#34;<span>POST</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>submit</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>Delete my account</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>forms</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>The form submits with JavaScript the instant they load the page!</p>
<p>CSRF is an extremely common and nasty vulnerability—especially since it’s a hole by default: if you don’t know what CSRF is, you likely have it in your application.</p>
<p>Traditionally the solution has been to use CSRF tokens—hidden form fields which “prove” that the user came from a form on your own site, and not a form hosted somewhere else. OWASP call this the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">Double Submit Cookie</a> pattern.</p>
<p>Web frameworks like Django implement <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/">CSRF protection</a> for you. I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf">asgi-csrf</a> to help add CSRF token protection to ASGI applications.</p>
<h4>Enter the SameSite cookie attribute</h4>
<p>Clearly it would be better if we didn’t have to worry about CSRF at all.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, work on specifying the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute started <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/commit/aa0722c12ccb367b8f4498e982616064d105a006#diff-70cc0c0600a934d002ea91a4a36d5eb0b7d5edebcce5a40c9a811391cc0fecf6">in June 2016</a>. The idea was to add an additional attribute to cookies that specifies the policy for if they should be included in requests made to a domain from pages hosted on another domain.</p>
<p>Today, all modern browsers support SameSite. MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite">has SameSite documentation</a>, but a summary is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SameSite=None</code>—the cookie is sent in “all contexts”—more-or-less how things used to work before SameSite was invented.</li>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Strict</code>—the cookie is only sent for requests that originate on the same domain. Even arriving on the site from an off-site link will not see the cookie, unless you subsequently refresh the page or navigate within the site.</li>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Lax</code>—cookie is sent if you navigate to the site through following a link from another domain but <em>not</em> if you submit a form. This is generally what you want to protect against CSRF attacks!</li>
</ul>
<p>The attribute is specified by the server in a <code>set-cookie</code> header that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>set-cookie: lax-demo=3473; Path=/; SameSite=lax
</code></pre>
<p>Why not habitually use <code>SameSite=Strict</code>? Because then if someone follows a link to your site their first request will be treated as if they are not signed in at all. That’s bad!</p>
<p>So explicitly setting a cookie with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> should be enough to protect your application from CSRF vulnerabilities... provided your users have a browser that supports it.</p>
<p>(Can I Use reports <a href="https://caniuse.com/same-site-cookie-attribute">93.95% global support</a> for the attribute—not quite high enough for me to stop habitually using CSRF tokens, but we’re getting there.)</p>
<h4>What if the SameSite attribute is missing?</h4>
<p>Here’s where things get interesting. If a cookie is set without a SameSite attribute at all, how should the browser treat it?</p>
<p>Over the past year, all of the major browsers have been changing their default behaviour. The goal is for a missing SameSite attribute to be treated as if it was <code>SameSite=Lax</code>—providing CSRF protection by default.</p>
<p>I have found it infuriatingly difficult to track down if and when this change has been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome/Chromium offer <a href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site">the best documentation</a>—they claim to have ramped up the new default to 100% of users in August 2020. WebViews in Android still have the old default behaviour, which is scheduled to be fixed in Android 12 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_12">not yet released</a>).</li>
<li>Firefox have a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/">blog entry from August 2020</a> which says “Starting with Firefox 79 (June 2020), we rolled it out to 50% of the Firefox Beta user base”—but I’ve not been able to find any subsequent updates.</li>
<li>I have no idea at all what’s going on with Safari!</li>
</ul>
<p>I started <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1422366158171238400">a Twitter thread</a> to try and collect more information, so please reply there if you know what’s going on in more detail.</p>
<h4>The Chrome 2-minute twist</h4>
<p>Assuming all of the above, the mystery remained: how did Yan’s exploit fail to be prevented by browsers?</p>
<p>After some back-and-forth about this on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1422370774896177154">Yan proposed</a> that the answer may be this detail, tucked away on the <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592">Chrome Platform Status page for Feature: Cookies default to SameSite=Lax</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Chrome will make an exception for cookies set without a SameSite attribute less than 2 minutes ago. Such cookies will also be sent with non-idempotent (e.g. POST) top-level cross-site requests despite normal SameSite=Lax cookies requiring top-level cross-site requests to have a safe (e.g. GET) HTTP method. Support for this intervention (“Lax + POST”) will be removed in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like OkCupid were setting their authentication cookie without a <code>SameSite</code> attribute... which opened them up to a form-based CSRF attack but only for the 120 seconds following the cookie being set!</p>
<h4>Building a tool to explore SameSite browser behaviour</h4>
<p>I was finding this all very confusing, so I built a tool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The code lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/samesite-lax-demo">simonw/samesite-lax-demo</a> on GitHub, but the tool itself has two sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A server-side Python (<a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>) web application for setting cookies with different <code>SameSite</code> attributes. This is hosted on Vercel at <a href="https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/">https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/</a>
</li>
<li>An HTML page on a different domain that links to that cookied site, provides a POST form targetting it, embeds an image from it and executes some <code>fetch()</code> requests against it. This is at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/samesite-lax-demo/">https://simonw.github.io/samesite-lax-demo/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hosting on two separate domains is critical for the tool to show what is going on. I chose Vercel and GitHub Pages because they are both trivial to set up to continuously deploy changes from a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Using the tool in different browsers helps show exactly what is going on with regards to cross-domain cookies.</p>
<p>A few of the things I observed using the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as you would expect. It’s particularly interesting to follow the regular <code>&lt;a href=...&gt;</code> link from the static site to the application and see how the strict cookie is NOT visible upon arrival—but becomes visible when you refresh that page.</li>
<li>I included a dynamically generated SVG in a <code>&lt;img src=&#34;/cookies.svg&#34;&gt;</code> image tag, which shows the cookies (using SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>) that are visible to the request. That image shows all four types of cookie when embedded on the Vercel domain, but when embedded on the GitHub pages domain it differs wildly:
<ul>
<li>Firefox 89 shows both the <code>SameSite=None</code> and the missing SameSite cookies</li>
<li>Chrome 92 shows just the <code>SameSite=None</code> cookie</li>
<li>Safari 14.0 shows no cookies at all!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chrome won’t let you set a <code>SameSite=None</code> cookie without including the <code>Secure</code> attribute.</li>
<li>I also added some JavaScript that makes a cross-domain <code>fetch(..., {credentials: &#34;include&#34;})</code> call against a <code>/cookies.json</code> endpoint. This didn’t send any cookies at all until I added server-side headers <code>access-control-allow-origin: https://simonw.github.io</code> and <code>access-control-allow-credentials: true</code>. Having done that, I got the same results across the three browsers as for the <code>&lt;img</code> test described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Safari ignoring <code>SameSite=None</code> turns out to be this bug: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198181">Cookies with SameSite=None or SameSite=invalid treated as Strict</a>—it’s marked as fixed but I’m not certain the fix has been released yet—it doesn’t seem to be fixed on my macOS 10.15.6 laptop or my iOS 14.7.1 iPhone.</p>
<p>Most excitingly, I was able to replicate the Chrome two minute window bug using the tool! Each cookie has its value set to the timestamp when it was created, and I added code to display how many seconds ago the cookie was set. Here’s an animation showing how Chrome on a form submission navigation can see the cookie that was set with <code>SameSite</code> missing at 114 seconds old, but that cookie is no longer visible once it passes 120 seconds.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Consider your subdomains</h4>
<p>One last note about CSRF that you should consider:  <code>SameSite=Lax</code> still allows form submissions from  subdomains of your primary domain to carry their cookies.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a XSS vulnerability on one of your subdomains the security of your primary domain will be compromised.</p>
<p>Since it’s common for subdomains to host other applications that may have their own security concerns, ditching CSRF tokens for Lax cookies may not be a wise step!</p>
<h4 id="login-csrf-samesite-lax">Login CSRF and SameSite=Lax</h4>
<p>Login CSRF is an interesting variety of CSRF with slightly different rules.</p>
<p>A Login CSRF attack is when a malicious forces a user to sign into an account controlled by the attacker. Why do this? Because if that user then saves sensitive information the attacker can see it.</p>
<p>Imagine I trick you into signing into an e-commerce account I control and saving your credit card details. I could then later sign in myself and buy things on your card!</p>
<p>Here’s how that would work: Say the site’s login form makes a POST to <code>https://www.example.com/login</code> with <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> as the form fields. If those credentials match, the site sets an authentication cookie.</p>
<p>I can set up my evil website with the following form:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span> <span>action</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/login</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>hidden</span>&#34; <span>name</span>=&#34;<span>username</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>my-username</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>hidden</span>&#34; <span>name</span>=&#34;<span>password</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>my-password</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>forms</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>I trick you into visiting my evil pge and you’re now signed in to that site using an account that I control. I cross my fingers and hope you don’t notice the “you are signed in as X” message in the UI.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about Login CSRF is that, since it involves setting a cookie but not sending a cookie, <code>SameSite=Lax</code> would seem to make no difference at all. You need to look to other mechanisms to protect against this attack.</p>
<p>But actually, you can use <code>SameSite=Lax</code> to prevent these. The trick is to only allow logins from users that are carrying at least one cookie which you have set in that way—since you know that those cookies could not have been sent if the user originated in a form on another site.</p>
<p>Another option: check the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin">HTTP Origin header</a> on the oncoming request.</p>
<h4>Final recommendations</h4>
<p>As an application developer, you should set all cookies with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> unless you have a very good reason not to. Most web frameworks do this by default now—Django shipped <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/9a56b4b13ed92d2d5bb00d6bdb905a73bc5f2f0a">support for this</a> in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/2.1/#requests-and-responses">Django 2.1</a> in August 2018.</p>
<p>Do you still need CSRF tokens as well? I think so: I don’t like the idea of users who fire up an older browser (maybe borrowing an obsolete computer) being vulnerable to this attack, and I worry about the subdomain issue described above.</p>
<p>And if you work for a browser vendor, please make it easier to find information on what the default behaviour is and when it was shipped!</p>

			<p>Portfolio reviews have returned to their in person form again, at least to a limited extent, as places are slowly opening up after nearly eighteen months of restrictions. So I recently found myself returning to Cortona, where the cars are reassuringly as <a href="https://leejo.github.io/2017/08/01/cortonas_damaged_cars/" target="_blank">damaged</a> as they have ever been:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was four years since my last visit so amongst viewing the exhibitions I attended a few portfolio reviews to show a <a href="https://www.formulanon.com" target="_blank">new project</a>, which is actually an old project - one I started shooting in 2009. I had shown this project a couple of weeks earlier at some online portfolio reviews in Arles, and going back further I had shown the works in progress at events in 2014, 2016, and 2018.</p>

<p>The work has changed and grown, my eye has matured, my photos have gotten better, more formal, more considered, the work is now more cohesive. Regardless the response to the project has always been positive<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, no matter what stage it was at.</p>

<p>The work is now in a much more complete form, namely a maquette (dummy book), albeit a very early draft form. But you can flick through it to get a much better feel for the project. There is still far too much work, but the early approach in these drafts is to keep the edit loose and tighten it up.</p>

<p>Presenting the work in this form has given me the same positive responses - it’s an interesting project, well shot, with a good balance of the formal, detail, landscape, and some humour. There is enough work to do a really tight strong edit, and scope to do multiple parts, along with editorial pieces. There are many single images that could stand on their own. It shows us something in a way we haven’t really seen it before.</p>

<p>Nice. But here comes the kicker, the question I have been hearing more as I present the project as a dummy photobook: “[If you are aiming to produce a book then] who is your audience?”</p>

<p><strong><i>Who</i> is Your Audience?</strong></p>

<p>The question is somewhat rhetorical of course, and I always answer it in the same way: photobooks are largely bought by people that buy photobooks, they are rarely bought by those who are interested in the subject of the project. When I say this the response by the reviewer is always a smile.</p>

<p>Because they know this to be true, whether they be a photobook publisher, editor, gallery owner, festival organiser, or whatever. The art world is small, the art photobook world is even smaller, and the numbers of art photobooks that sell is smaller still.</p>

<p>People don’t buy art. I’m generalising here of course, where “people” represents the public at large. I say this having been involved in a gallery and exhibition space since early 2018, one that probably sells <em>more</em> volume (in terms of unit, not necessarily price) than most - a gallery in an alpine ski resort. Sure we get lots of visitors, lots of positive comments, but the ratio of visitors to sales is probably, what, 25:1? And that’s people that get into the gallery, the ratio of passers-by to visitors is much larger.</p>

<p>And people really don’t buy photobooks either. Where do you even find photobooks? Bookshops, maybe, but only the larger ones will stock photobooks and even then only the top sellers. Photobook shops, sure they exist but not really outside of the big/arty cities? Galleries, yes but most people don’t visit those. Direct from artist and publisher websites? Yep, sure. Amazon.com? Or course, but who is going to drop $40+ on an unseen photobook?</p>

<p>We can probably break down the potential buyers, the audience for photobooks, into five groups being those who…</p>

<ol>
  <li>… are interested in photobooks (regardless of the subject)</li>
  <li>… are interested in the artist/subject/project (and maybe buy photobooks/prints)</li>
  <li>… are interested in the concept (“the book as an object” type of thing)</li>
  <li>… buy photobooks as gifts for others (some crossover with 1)</li>
  <li>… buy photobooks as an investment (flippers/resellers).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of my purchasing is a combination of 1 and 2 - I am interested in photobooks but am informed significantly by the subject/project. There are many photobooks that find themselves as best sellers, or award winning, or praised by many, that I have no interest in.</p>

<p>The ideal project for a publisher is something that combines the first four groups. Get that right and you could be looking at sales figures two orders of magnitude larger than the norm. What’s the norm? Well most photobooks by established fine art photobook publishers sell in the region of hundreds of copies. If you self publish you might sell dozens. If the photographer is well established, or the publisher has a much bigger marketing effort and/or reach then a few thousand copies might be sold. Maybe, just maybe, sales might break tens of thousands if everything comes together. This is rare.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised by the low numbers. As I said - photobooks are mostly bought be people that buy photobooks! And quality photobooks are expensive, which largely alienates those in groups 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>To expand on this - I recently spoke with a publisher about my project and they liked it but expressed it wasn’t commercial and might sell a 1,000 copies at a push. Which is entirely fair. They then gave an example of one of their recent releases, a book of dog photography<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and said that it had <em>only</em> sold about 4,000 copies despite a massive marketing push and a joint effort with a larger publisher.</p>

<p>But photos of dogs? The audience for this book from the above list is 2 and 4, and I would say the “gifts for others” group is significantly reduced as the book is priced at £35. So we’re left with “those who are interested in the artist/subject/project” - but all the dog owners I know would have absolutely no interest in a photobook of dogs. If they want to see photos of dogs they’ll just search for #dog using Instagram, and scroll until the heat death of the universe, they’re not going to buy a book.</p>

<p>That’s definitely some [dog] food for thought: the number of dog owners is massive, a quick search suggests one in four people have a dog. But the number of those who would buy a photobook? If we assume best (or worst?) case here that everyone of those had become aware of the book that means approx 0.000001%<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> given the sales figure of 4,000 copies.</p>

<p><strong>Who is <i>Your</i> Audience?</strong></p>

<p>If you ever watch photography videos on YouTube you’ve probably stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/froknowsphoto/videos" target="_blank">Jared Polin</a>. Jared’s channel is an example of many of those you can find on YouTube, in that it’s more about technology than photography.</p>

<p>They’re the modern equivalent to the magazines that used to be popular in the 80s/90s/00s - full of articles on how to use your camera, reviews of new gear, post processing tips, all that kind of stuff. It’s useful, and potentially interesting stuff, and really quite popular, but it’s not really what I would class as “photographic” content.</p>

<p>Jared isn’t alone here - there are literally thousands of these channels on YouTube that have the same type of content. Some channels even started out more photographic but pivoted heavily towards the technology type of content as they realised that’s what most people want. “The Art of Photography” for example is one of those channels that pivoted a few years ago to this content<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because it sells, in terms of views. Massively so in some cases. And that’s because most people who are interested in photography are interested in content about the technology; they buy cameras and lenses and accessories and software, they don’t buy prints or photobooks or visit galleries and exhibitions.</p>

<p>Most photographers aren’t really interested in art either, so they don’t buy it. I mean, how many photographers do you know that have shelves full of photobooks?</p>

<p>Order “The Art of Photography” videos by most popular and you have to scroll a long way beyond the clickbait gear reviews before you get to the (excellent) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGEE7pGLuppS6Wn-FHetQPfo0QbeDiTYe" target="_blank">“The Artist Series”</a> - content that receives one fifth of the views of the technology focussed videos.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Your <i>Audience</i>?</strong></p>

<p>So what happened when Jared decided to create a photobook? That’s somewhat of a pivot in terms of content. Would his audience be the same as those who watch his videos, listen to his podcast, buy his tutorials and plugins? No, I think that’s evident from what I’ve already said. However, Jared’s channel has (as of writing) 1.3million subscribers.</p>

<p>Could he sell a couple of thousand copies to some of those 1.3million subscribers? A couple of thousand copies by any measure is large number for a photobook. For a self published book that figure is enormous.</p>

<p>I think it’s worth pointing out that this appears to be more a project about the making of a high quality photobook rather than the actual subject of the photobook itself. Jared has been drip feeding content on the making of the book for <a href="https://www.berniephotobook.com/info" target="_blank">several months</a>, which reveals some of the thought process, costs, design decisions, and goals.</p>

<p>I found out about this project via Hacker News<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and spent some time watching Jared’s videos and listening to the podcasts. So, immediately Jared captured at least one more viewer/listener (per video) via a comment on an entirely unrelated source - a lot of projects are discovered this way. Mission accomplished, right? Eh maybe. Let’s go over what went through my head when I watched/listened to the rationale and learned about the project. I jotted down notes here as bullet points, with my thoughts/responses in italics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jared wants to tell a story via photos
    <ul>
      <li>but is adamant on having QR codes from the offset (little to no text)</li>
      <li><em>so it’s telling a story via photos but largely by additional commentary?</em></li>
      <li>would rather listen to the story than read (<em>would he get this far in this blog post?</em>)</li>
      <li>perceives the book as a vehicle for the QR code/commentary/audio story
        <ul>
          <li><em>so from the offset this is not really a <strong>photo</strong>book</em> in the traditional sense?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Was initially aiming more at his YouTube core audience
    <ul>
      <li>wanted a book (or books) of all previous work/photo stores</li>
      <li>the Bernie book idea came later
        <ul>
          <li><em>perhaps the realisation that these videos wouldn’t appeal to the audience of technologists informed that?</em></li>
          <li><em>and that those who might buy the book are less interested in Jared’s work?</em></li>
          <li><em>so something more cohesive, or less about Jared would be a better first book?</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Estimates 1% of viewers (of this series of videos) will buy a book
    <ul>
      <li>25,000 views -&gt; 250 sales
        <ul>
          <li><em>seems like a realistic percentage</em></li>
        </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Very much focusing on the book as an object, in terms of size, quality, QR codes

      <li><em>it’s about the book (as an object), the documentary, the commentary, YouTube</em></li>
      <li>“it’s about the story” <em>of making the book, not the subject of the book</em></li>
      <li><em>this is not a book about Bernie, it’s a book about Jared who happened to be shooting photos of Bernie</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should reserve any opinion on the actual book until I have seen it, but at $120 (being a EU purchaser) it’s not something I am willing to spend that much on given what I have seen so far - there’s enough here to form an initial set of thoughts…</p>

<p>In general it’s cool to see more of this content on photography channels that are usually more focused on the gear. However, as a photobook this is probably pretty weak. It’s not a compelling project or photobook, nor would the time frame yield enough variety in images to create a strong edit. You need to follow your subject for a much longer time period (months, if not <em>years</em>) to get enough content to make a photobook<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The preview images we see are nothing new, nor are they strong enough to make most people want to see more. The three (?) shoots might yield enough photos to make a good six, twelve, or twenty image editorial piece, but a book? If you were going to create a book from this you might want to play with the form a little and perhaps be a bit more meta in the design.</p>

<p>Although the subject is divisive (just look at some of the comments on the videos), that’s not necessarily a bad thing if you can work around it. I have photobooks on political figures that I abhor<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, but the books or projects/approach are done brilliantly. The problem in Jared’s project is that there’s too many images, too many of them are (probably?) too similar, and we’ve seen it all before.</p>

<p>Even the “bangers” aren’t that interesting - we’ve seen <a href="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/650/299/d049cb0202cc44fe9aad02b3af6737ed_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1621968045&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=674ef84cb92580b21930811b98005068" target="_blank">these types of photos</a> thousands of times, either contextually within <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=political+rally&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">the type of photography we see from political rallies</a> or otherwise. So you’re never going to appeal to those who dislike the subject of the book but might be interested in photobooks.</p>

<p>Other problems are that it’s big and expensive even by photobook standards. $60 + $60 to ship outside the US means $120. Jared is losing a large part of his audience that exists outside the US who might have bought the book. The book doesn’t need to be as big as it is, half to two thirds the size (dimensions and number of photos) would have made a much cheaper book to buy and ship.</p>

<p>The QR codes for commentary approach is an interesting one but ultimately a mistake I feel. These will be non-functioning in twenty or even ten years time; the book will be left to stand alone on its photographic content, which <em>most</em> photobooks should anyway, so focus on making the strongest book of photos.</p>

<p>All that said, Jared’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jaredpolin/bernie" target="_blank">campaign</a> was successful<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, more than doubling its (financial) goal. It looks like the number of copies pre-sold will be close to the estimate of 500 and if the book is on Amazon as well it may well sell a few hundred more. It looks like Jared will be close to breaking even, perhaps a small profit.</p>

<p>However, the reality is that if an unknown photographer had created and self published this book they might have sold a dozen copies. Fifty copies if they were very lucky. It really is an editorial piece at most, not a book project. I suspect Jared will still have a few pallets of the book stuck in storage for a while if he has ordered 2,000 books.</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> an outlier. A photographer with an inbuilt audience large enough that the subset of “those who are interested in photobooks” and “those who are interested in the artist/subject/project” created the sales. I suspect the majority are of the latter not the former. Jared will have gained more subscribers and viewers due to the nature of the project (the “making of”) rather than the subject of the project, so I think he/we can say yes: mission accomplished.</p>

<p>So props to Jared for achieving that, all while creating content that is more interesting than the usual content on his channel and being transparent on the process and costs - I’m sure many viewers were shocked to realise how much producing a high quality photobook can cost. This type of content I would consider something a bit more “photographic”, let’s see more of this in future please?</p>

<p><strong>So, Who is <i>My</i> Audience?</strong></p>

<p>I think we’ve established that I don’t know, other than the aforementioned reply of “the photobook crowd”, which is pretty small. Clearly there’s crossover with the audience that follows the subject, an audience of five hundred million fans, but probably not so much. If I can capture one percent of one percent of one percent that’s an entire print run for most small independent photobook publishers. Maybe.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/" target="_blank">I’ve put a sample of the work out there</a>. Not just this project, but others I have been working on over the past decade as well. It’s a small sample - in the case of the Formula 1 work just thirty images out of over two thousand, of which I would say one/two hundred are strong enough to be part of a final edit.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> a small sample, but aimed to create interest. I’ve held this back for long enough, now I need to get it out there. I hope to find my audience, but I figure it’s more likely they will find me.</p>

      <title>In internal memo, Apple addresses concerns around new Photo scanning features</title>
      <link>https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-internal-memo-icloud-photo-scanning-concerns/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
						<p>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/05/apple-announces-new-protections-for-child-safety-imessage-safety-icloud-photo-scanning-more/">yesterday officially announced</a> a range of new features coming later this year, dubbed Expanded Protections for Children. The new features include protections for sensitive images in iMessage, iCloud Photo scanning for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) content, and new knowledge for Siri and Search. </p>
<p>In an internal memo distributed to the teams that worked on this project and obtained by <em>9to5Mac, </em>Apple acknowledges the “misunderstandings” around the new features, but doubles down on its belief that these features are part of an “important mission” for keeping children safe. </p>

<p>Apple has faced a significant amount of pushback for these features, including from notable sources such <a href="https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1423469854347169798?s=21">as Edward Snowden</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. The criticism centers primarily on Apple’s plans to scan iCloud Photos to check against a database of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) for matches and the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/comment-apples-child-protection-measures-get-mixed-reactions-from-experts/">potential implications of such a feature</a>. </p>
<p>The memo, which was distributed late last night and obtained by <em>9to5Mac</em>, was written by Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a software VP at Apple. Marineau-Mes says that Apple will continue to “explain and detail the features” included in this suite of Expanded Protections for Children. </p>
<p>Marineau-Mes writes that while Apple has seen “many positive responses” to these new features, it is aware that “some people have misunderstandings” about how the features will work, and “more than a few are worried about the implications.” Nonetheless, Marineau-Mes doubles down on Apple’s belief that these are necessary features to “protect children” while also maintaining Apple’s “deep commitment to user privacy.” </p>
<p>Here is the memo in full: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today marks the official public unveiling of Expanded Protections for Children, and I wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for all of your hard work over the last few years. We would not have reached this milestone without your tireless dedication and resiliency.</p>
<p>Keeping children safe is such an important mission. In true Apple fashion, pursuing this goal has required deep cross-functional commitment, spanning Engineering, GA, HI, Legal, Product Marketing and PR. What we announced today is the product of this incredible collaboration, one that delivers tools to protect children, but also maintain Apple’s deep commitment to user privacy. </p>
<p>We’ve seen many positive responses today. We know some people have misunderstandings, and more than a few are worried about the implications, but we will continue to explain and detail the features so people understand what we’ve built. And while a lot of hard work lays ahead to deliver the features in the next few months, I wanted to share this note that we received today from NCMEC. I found it incredibly motivating, and hope that you will as well.</p>
<p>I am proud to work at Apple with such an amazing team. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memo also includes a message from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, signed by Marita Rodriguez, executive director of strategic partnerships. Apple is working closely with NCMEC on the new iCloud scanning features. </p>
<p>Here is the full text of the note from NCMEC sent to the team at Apple working on these features: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team Apple,</p>
<p>I wanted to share a note of encouragement to say that everyone at NCMEC is SO PROUD of each of you and the incredible decisions you have made in the name of prioritizing child protection.</p>
<p>It’s been invigorating for our entire team to see (and play a small role in) what you unveiled today.</p>
<p>I know it’s been a long day and that many of you probably haven’t slept in 24 hours. We know that the days to come will be filled with the screeching voices of the minority.</p>
<p>Our voices will be louder.</p>
<p>Our commitment to lift up kids who have lived through the most unimaginable abuse and victimizations will be stronger.</p>
<p>During these long days and sleepless nights, I hope you take solace in knowing that because of you many thousands of sexually exploited victimized children will be rescued, and will get a chance at healing and the childhood they deserve.</p>
<p>Thank you for finding a path forward for child protection while preserving privacy.</p>

      <title>Learning APL</title>

  <div id="introduction">

<blockquote>
<p>A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
–<em>Alan Perlis</em></p></blockquote>
<div id="who-is-this-for">
<h2>Who is this for?<a href="#who-is-this-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I wrote this to be the book I would have wanted to read when I started to learn APL. An introduction to APL for an experienced practitioner from a different programming language or two. We all learn in different ways, and I prefer the fundamental concepts laid bare first, and then learn by example.</p>
<p>I came to APL after discovering a file of <a href="https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/ad.k">solutions</a> to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> 2015 challenge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)">K</a>, an APL derivative. That’s around 100 lines of actual code, and whilst I didn’t understand any of it, I kept looking at it, trying to figure out which of the 50 problems (well, 49) this was a solution to. Each of my Python solutions typically ran to 50-100 lines+ for the bulk of the problems.</p>
<p>Turns out it was the whole lot. That blew my mind.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-apl">
<h2>What is APL?<a href="#what-is-apl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>APL is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">array language</a>, and one of the oldest programming languages still in use today, next to <a href="https://fortran-lang.org/">FORTRAN</a>, <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">Lisp</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>. APL uses its own curious-looking symbols, like <code><span>⍎⌽⍕⌈*○≡⍬</span></code>, rather than reserved words written out in English like most other languages, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. As a language, APL sits at a very high level of abstraction, making it well suited to ultra-concise formulations of algorithms.</p>
<p>APL is a language that time is only now beginning to catch up with. Modern processors sport dedicated vector-oriented instructions and APL presents a high degree of mechanical sympathy ideally suited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD instructions</a> and by often being completely branchless in nature. APL, and its more punk rock little sister, K, really <em>fly</em>. APL can offer unprecedented programmer efficiency, as well as all-out execution speed.</p>
<p>But isn’t <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/is-apl-dead/">APL dead</a>? APL is alive and well.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-should-i-learn-apl">
<h2>Why should I learn APL?<a href="#why-should-i-learn-apl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will have your own motivations for wanting to learn APL. If you’re searching for the hottest thing on the market right now, to land a job at a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp">FAANG</a> or pad your resumé with the most marketable skills, there are many other programming languages that will offer a better return: <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>… APL doesn’t make a show in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a> in the top 100 “most popular” programming languages. Apparently, COBOL, <a href="https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_programming.html">Logo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> are all more “popular” than APL, at the time of writing. That’s not to say there aren’t extremely well-paid jobs around for engineers with skills in the “Iverson-family” languages (<a href="https://www.dyalog.com">APL</a>, <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/#/">J</a>, <a href="https://shakti.sh/">K</a>, <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/learn/startingkdb/language/">Q</a> etc), especially in finance. There are.</p>
<p>However, learning APL will reward you in other ways. Perhaps the old trope about “expanding your mind” is tired, but if your background is “C-like” – C, <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>, Java, Python etc – you will be exposed to a new way of solving problems. In fact, learning new programming languages that come from a different paradigm is a force multiplier for your brain.</p>
<p>Talking about Lisp, but equally applicable to APL, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a> says in his essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to become a hacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisp is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the topic of Lisp, one of my <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">favorite xkcd strips</a> talks about Lisp’s parentheses as ‘elegant weapons for a more civilized age’, paraphrasing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb8AYnRb-4">Star Wars</a>. It could also have been said about APL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>APL was conceived as a <em>notation for thought</em>. It actually took years before it even had an actual implementation as a programming language. APL is a very natural way to express algorithms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson">Ken Iverson</a>, the creator of APL, was awarded the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/iverson_9147499.cfm">ACM Turing Award</a> in 1979 for his work on APL, and his accompanying paper, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358896.358899">Notation as a Tool of Thought</a> is somewhat of a computer science milestone. <a href="https://www.dyalog.com">Dyalog</a>, a leading commercial APL solutions provider, make a reference to this in their corporate tag-line: “The Tool of Thought for Software Solutions”.</p>
<p>If you persist, you may discover an added bonus: code you write in <em>other</em> languages suddenly becomes more concise and efficient, too.</p>

<div id="but-it-s-unreadable">
<h2>…but it’s unreadable!<a href="#but-it-s-unreadable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every time APL gets a mention on <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=apl&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=story">Hacker News</a> (it happens regularly), someone chirps up in the comments that “APL is unreadable”, so let’s deal with that upfront.</p>

</div>
<p>There it is – perfectly readable: squiggle, squiggle, greek letter, weird symbol….</p>
<p>The key is that readability is in the eye of the beholder. To an APL programmer, the above implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a> is perfectly readable. Claiming that something is unreadable because <em>you</em> can’t read it is intellectually dishonest. I don’t speak, or indeed read, Japanese, but that doesn’t make Japanese in any way unreadable. As master haiku smith, Bashō (松尾 金作), exclaimed:</p>

<p>The summer grasses. // All that remains // Of warriors’ dreams.</p>
<p>What is a fairer observation is that APL <em>doesn’t look anything like</em> the other programming languages you know, and yes, learning APL sure presents a different kind of challenge. If you’re a seasoned (say) Python programmer, and you decide to pick up <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, you can reasonably expect to follow code written by others from day 1, and learn enough syntax within a day or two to write code yourself. Sure, it takes a bit longer to find your way around the standard library and learn how to write idiomatic Ruby, but still. If you’ve learned a few languages like that, picking up another represents known and quantifiable effort.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: there <em>will</em> be more initial friction when learning APL – for starters, your keyboard doesn’t even have the squiggly symbols! Having said that, APL is a <em>tiny</em> language – there is negligible amounts of syntax to pick up, and believe it or not, actually quite easy to learn at a superficial level, once you get past the practical barriers.</p>
<p>What takes longer is to grasp the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myoK22rq1jk">APL <em>way</em></a> – how to wield it idiomatically, if you like. Learning how to solve problems the data-parallel way, no loops, no branching, is the key to writing APL that rocks.</p>
<p>Once you get used to it, APL is <em>more</em> readable than more verbose languages [ <em>citation needed</em> ]. It strips away all the fluff, leaving only the algorithmic intent. <a href="https://beyondloom.com/about/index.html">John Earnest</a>, creator of <a href="http://johnearnest.github.io/ok/index.html">oK</a>, wrote a humorous <a href="http://beyondloom.com/blog/denial.html">blog post</a> on the topic, and <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/">Aaron Hsu</a>’s presentation on <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/apl-style-patterns-and-anti-patterns-in-apl/">APL patterns and anti-patterns</a> make some of the same points in a more serious vein.</p>
<p>The last example from John Earnest’s blog post poses the hypothetical question – which is more readable, the JavaScript</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>let</span> <span>max</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>list</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>No, not really, no.</p>
<p>Whilst APL can be traced back to Iverson’s attempts at fixing some of the shortcomings of traditional mathematical notation, you don’t have to be a math-wiz to understand, or benefit from, APL. If you’re familiar with sums and products, or if you know another programming language, that’s all you need. If you <em>do</em> have a background in maths, especially in linear algebra, you’ll no doubt recognize some concepts along the way.</p>

<h2>A note on our APL subset<a href="#a-note-on-our-apl-subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dyalog’s APL dialect, which we’ll chiefly work with here, has been around for a long time, and carries with it a lot of history in the shape of backwards compatibility. APL has also evolved a lot over the years. Dyalog’s APL is really two rather different languages rolled into one: <em>traditional</em> style, which is procedural, and the newer <em>dfn</em> (pronouced <em>DEE-fun</em>) style, which is functional(ish, but let’s not quibble). For the purposes of this exercise, we’re going to pretend that the traditional style doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>When we claim that there are no if-statements or loops in APL, how come one can write</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>∇</span> <span>FizzBuzz</span> <span>end</span><span>;</span><span>i</span>

<p>which certainly looks both iffy and loopy – and dare I say even moderately readable, almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>-chic? This is an example of an APL trad-function, which we from now onwards will pretend doesn’t exist. This isn’t a value judgment so much as a practical one in the context of this book. We will not cover the traditional style, nor Dyalog’s object orientation extensions, and for simplicity’s sake, when we from now on talk about APL, take that to mean “our subset of APL”.</p>
<p>As an historical aside, the “newer” <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10007770">dfn style</a> first appeared in Dyalog 8.1, from early 1997, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Scholes">John Scholes</a>. So not <em>that</em> new.</p>
<div id="not-covered">
<h3>Not covered<a href="#not-covered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Specifically, we’re not going to cover tradfns, OO, inverses, the trigonometric functions, complex numbers, variant, I-beams, spawn, threads, isolates, format, most of the ⎕-fns, .NET integration and probably many more.</p>

<div id="is-terser-better">
<h2>Is terser better?<a href="#is-terser-better" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>APL’s <em>raison d’être</em> is to cut out the noise, to become an extension of thought. A lofty aim, for sure. APL code can be exceptionally compact; no other general-purpose programming language (apart from its siblings) gets close. No bit of code we write here will likely be longer than a few lines, and anecdotally, from personal experience, the difference runs to perhaps an order of magnitude compared with Python.</p>
<p>Is terser better? Opinions differ here. APLers, only half-jokingly, say they never scroll. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)">Arthur Whitney</a>, the creator of K, reputedly <em>hates</em> scrolling, even when writing in C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The K binary weighs in at about 50Kb. Someone asked about the interpreter source code. A frown flickered across the face of our visitor from Microsoft: what could be interesting about that? “The source is currently 264 lines of C,” said Arthur. I thought I heard a sotto voce “that’s not possible.” Arthur showed us how he had arranged his source code in five files so that he could edit any one of them without scrolling. “Hate scrolling,” he mumbled.</p></blockquote>
<p>(from <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10500700">Vector</a>)</p>
<p>Being able to see your whole implementation on a single page of code cuts down on context switching, and at least anecdotally makes mistakes easier to spot.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in the history of APL, a good read is Kromberg and Hui’s weighty paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386319">APL since 1978</a>. Morten and Roger do all their own stunts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jsoftware.com">J Software</a> maintains a rich collection of APL-related <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/">publications</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://vector.org.uk/">Vector</a> is the journal of the British APL Association.</p>
<p>A comprehensive, but now a bit outdated, reference is Legrand’s door stopper <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/documents/MasteringDyalogAPL.pdf">Mastering Dyalog APL</a>, all 800+ pages of it. It covers a lot of ground that we’re not touching upon here. Work is afoot to update <a href="https://mastering.dyalog.com">MDAPL</a> to cover a more recent version of Dyalog.</p>
<p>As you get a bit further along your path to APL mastery, the <a href="https://aplcart.info/?w">APL Cart</a> indexed idiom collection is an <em>amazing</em> resource.</p>
<p>The chat room <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52405/the-apl-orchard">APL Orchard</a> on Stack Exchange features some of the sharpest minds on the array programming circuit. It’s a welcoming place for newbies, too, and every now and then hosts so called <em>cultivations</em> – impromptu interactive lessons. A list of old cultivations is <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/52405/the-apl-orchard?tab=conversations">here</a>. Drop in and say ‘hi’ – chances are that you will be given a private APL intro lesson (in public).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aplwiki.com/">APL Wiki</a> is a rich and growing source of knowledge.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s own developer <a href="http://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm">documentation</a> is a reference - rich depth, but not the easiest place to learn new things from. <a href="https://dyalog.tv/">Dyalog TV</a> hosts Dyalog’s back catalog of webinars and lots of conference presentations with a lot of varied nuggets. There is also the Dyalog <a href="https://forums.dyalog.com/">forums</a> although a bit low-volume.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s docs for the <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/">dfns</a> workspace is a treasure trove of APL exotica. It’s what passes as a “standard library” for Dyalog, and some of it is useful for everyday coding (like <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_segs.htm">segs</a> and <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_iotag.htm">iotag</a>), and other stuff perhaps less so – but you can learn a lot by looking at its implementations to see what “real APL” looks like.</p>
<p>Speaking of “real APL”, Dyalog has a lot of public code in their <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog">github</a>, which is a great resource.</p>

<h2>Ok, I’m convinced, how do I get started?<a href="#ok-i-m-convinced-how-do-i-get-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a couple of options. To get started right now, you can head to <a href="https://tryapl.org/">TryAPL</a>, which is a web version of Dyalog APL’s latest and greatest release. That should work for most of the stuff we’ll do here.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Dyalog APL is a commercial product, not open source. Fortunately, they offer a generous non-commercial free to use clause in their licensing terms, so you can <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm">download and install Dyalog APL</a> locally without cost, as long as you’re not making money from it.</p>
</div>
<p>Dyalog consists of the APL interpreter itself, and an IDE. You’ll also need to install a font with the APL glyphs (as the “squiggles” are actually called) and a keyboard layout, depending on your platform. I am using Dyalog version 18 on MacOS, which comes with an IDE called <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/ride">RIDE</a>. On Windows you get a different IDE.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/">GNU APL</a>, and whilst there are similarities, its dialect is a bit different. GNU APL was made to be a <em>libre</em> software reimplementation of IBM’s APL2, and Dyalog has moved on quite a bit from this. The examples we present here are unlikely to all function as-is in GNU APL. Other options are <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ngn/apl">ngn/apl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/APL">dzaima/apl</a>, both hobbyist implementations that roughly implement the subset we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Dyalog also has an excellent <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-kernel">kernel</a> that allows you to use APL in the Jupyter notebook interface – which indeed is how this book is written.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve managed to get the APL keyboard layout installed, you’ll be hunting and pecking for a while. It takes a few days to learn where the most useful glyphs reside. The Dyalog IDE has the <em>language bar</em> at the top which you can also use – and hovering over a glyph will indicate where it resides on the keyboard. Here’s what my RIDE shows in terms of keyboard layout:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are you ready? Let’s begin.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-first-tentative-steps">
<h2>Our first tentative steps<a href="#our-first-tentative-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is to specify our <em>index origin</em>. In most programming languages in use today, arrays are indexed starting from 0, with a few notable exceptions (for example <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>). In APL, the index origin is a configurable option. Leaving aside for a moment as to if this is a good idea or not, it’s one of those things that sooner or later will catch you out. We’ll try to always be explicit. If, when trying to run code someone else wrote, you’re faced with an <code><span>INDEX</span> <span>ERROR</span></code>, it’s worth changing the index origin to see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s default index origin is 1, but we’ll set it to 0 for the least possible surprise. We won’t use anything where this actually matters for a while, but let’s get used to it from the beginning.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⎕IO</span> <span>←</span> <span>0</span> <span>⍝ Index origin gets 0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We pronounce this as “quad-eye-oh gets zero”. The left-arrow, <code><span>←</span></code>, called <em>Gets</em>, is the symbol for assignment. The green text following the <code><span>⍝</span></code> symbol is a comment. APL’s comment symbol is called <em>Lamp</em> – and a bit of an <em>aide-memoire</em> – comments should illuminate the code. On my keyboard, it lives on the comma-key, and is a useful first APL key sequence to memorise. Does it look like a lamp?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe an LED? Or a kerosene lamp, depending on how long you’ve been doing APL for. Anyway - a comment.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⍝ This line does nothing!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The usual arithmetic operations work as expected, don’t they?</p>

<p>Ok, that may have come as a surprise. It turns out that <code><span>*</span></code> is the symbol for exponentiation, not multiplication. If we want to multiply, we need to use <code><span>×</span></code> (which lives on the <code><span>-</span></code> key):</p>

<p>Ok, what about division?</p>

<p>Nope. The slash does something decidedly not-division. We’ll get back to that one later. Division is <code><span>÷</span></code>, not <code><span>/</span></code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>20</span><span>÷</span><span>4</span> <span>⍝ Division is ÷, not /</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>Negative numbers are not written with the traditional minus-sign, but with a special glyph, the <em>High minus</em>: <code><span>¯</span></code></p>

<p>Here’s another surprise:</p>

<p>In any other language, or indeed on a calculator, that would have given 17. So what’s going on here? We’re taught that multiplication goes before addition since year 1 in school. We’ve stumbled on one of the things in mathematical notation that motivated Iverson to create APL: in mathematics, operator precedence is kind of awkward and irregular.</p>
<p>In APL, everything evaluates strictly right to left. If you want to bend this evaluation order, you’ll need parentheses.</p>

<p>We can assign a value to a variable using <em>Gets</em> (<code><span>←</span></code>) that we met earlier:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>←</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>×</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>7</span> <span>⍝ a gets 17. </span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>⍝ Just evaluating the variable returns its value</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⊢</span><span>a</span> <span>←</span> <span>42</span> <span>⍝ a gets 42, and please evaluate it so I can see the value</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>The glyph <code><span>⊢</span></code> is called <a href="http://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Symbols/Right%20Tack.htm"><em>Right tack</em></a>, and is a function referred to as <em>Same</em>. It simply returns its argument. Used like this it allows us to show the result of an expression even if the expression itself wouldn’t normally return a result. <em>Right tack</em> might seem like a pretty pointless function, but we’ll put it to good use later in different contexts. To “print” the value of a variable we can also use <em>Quad gets</em>, <code><span>⎕</span> <span>←</span></code>:</p>

<p>As a mnemonic, you can think of the <em>Quad</em> (<code><span>⎕</span></code>) glyph representing your computer screen (or a piece of printer paper) in this context. And for the avoidance of any doubt, the <em>Quad</em> glyph really <em>is</em> a little rectangle, and not the symbol used to show a character set mismatch on badly formed web pages.</p>
<p>APL variable names follow mostly similar rules to other programming languages – any combination of letters (upper, and lower case), digits (apart from the first character), and the underscore symbol (<code><span>_</span></code>):</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>fiftySeven</span> <span>←</span> <span>57</span>
<span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>five38</span> <span>←</span> <span>538</span>
<span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>My_Variable_Name</span> <span>←</span> <span>&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>One convention you’ll occasionally see is the <code><span>_</span></code> variable, which is sometimes used to denote a value we don’t care about. There is nothing special about a variable called <code><span>_</span></code> – it’s just a convention.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>_</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>←</span> <span>3</span> <span>1</span> <span>4</span> <span>1</span> <span>⍝ Don&#39;t care about the third value</span>
<span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>d</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>There are two additional characters you can use in names, <code><span>⍙</span></code> and <code><span>∆</span></code>, if you feel the need to add extra spice in the lives of others reading your code. An advantage of APL’s use of glyphs instead of reserved words is that it’s impossible to create names that clash with internal or reserved words in APL.</p>
<p>You can of course use whatever naming convention that pleases you, but <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ad%C3%A1m_Brudzewsky">Adám</a> from Dyalog has written up an informal <a href="https://abrudz.github.io/style/">style guide</a> that’s useful reading. As APL lends itself to a terse style, long, rambling, Java-esque variable names are frowned upon. Here are some <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Dado/wiki/How-Not-To-Code-In-Dyalog-APL">opinionated home truths</a> from the Carlisle Group, too, to consider on your APL journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="valence">
<h2>Valence<a href="#valence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Valence</em> (sometimes called <em>arity</em>, too) refers to the way that functions expect arguments. In APL, we talk about <em>monadic</em> and <em>dyadic</em> functions and operators (and occasionally <em>niladic</em>, too).</p>
<p>There is a central tenet when writing about programming that for every mention of the word <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monad</a> you lose half your readership. We can blame Team <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Haskell</a> for that. Fear not – we’re staying right out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>. Whilst APL has monadic functions and operators, the term predates Haskell by some margin, and really refers to something different altogether. Hey, Haskell, make up your own words, will you? Just kidding, we’re huge Haskell fans.</p>
<p>APL functions can take arguments on either side, just like you’re perfectly used to with arithmetic operators in many other languages (not Lisps):</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>⍝ Infix function application, dyadic +</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>In a Lispy language, function application is always monadic, even for arithmetic, so you’d write</p>

<p>When we say that a function is <code><span>dyadic</span></code> in APL, all we mean is that the function takes both a left, and a right argument, like the <code><span>+</span></code> example above. A <code><span>monadic</span></code> function, conversely, is a function that only takes a right argument, for example, <em>Factorial</em>, <code><span>!</span></code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>7</span> <span>⍝ Monadic ! is factorial: 1×2×3×4×5×6×7</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>Some APL functions can be either monadic or dyadic, and in many cases these have different meanings – an endless source of <s>confusion</s> joy for the beginner. For example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>7</span><span>×</span><span>3</span> <span>⍝ Dyadic × is multiplication</span>
<span>×</span><span>¯7</span> <span>⍝ Monadic × is &#39;direction&#39;, or signum (the sign, in our case). Thanks.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>In the Dyalog IDE, if you hover over a glyph in the language bar, it will show brief examples of both its monadic and dyadic uses, where applicable. Some claim you can learn the whole language by hovering over this bar.</p>

<div><figure></figure><div>
<p>I recently bought a Xiaomi Poco F3 (128GB) at £234 from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mi.com/uk/" target="_blank">Xiaomi UK website</a>. I think it is great hardware at this price. I have been using iPhone for the last three years (XR-&gt;11-&gt;12). Once I saw this deal on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/" target="_blank">hotukdeals</a> website, I thought I should give it a try to Android after three years.  I knew it will come with a lot of bloatware and I cannot uninstall them in a normal way, but I was ready to deal with it a hard way. </p>




</div></div>



<p>Before making the final decision for the purchase, I did a quick research on Google and I found some good articles that explain how to remove bloatware on the phone via ADB shell. It seemed straight forward and I decided to purchase the phone.</p>



<p>As soon as I got my phone, I followed these articles and started removing them one by one. However, I made a big mistake and suddenly my phone locked itself. I didn’t know that I should remove my phone from my Xiaomi Account before removing the Mi Account application. I had to call Mi Customer Support but they didn’t help at all, the guy on the phone asked me to reset my Mi Account password (didn’t understand why), once he realized that didn’t work, he asked me to send my identification documents to Xiaomi so that they could remove the lock. It was funny because I was removing these applications to stop sharing my personal data. After I did a bit of research on the internet, I found the solution.  However, it was definitely annoying. </p>



<p>If you want to debloat your phone, I suggest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.naldotech.com/xiaomi-poco-f3-bloatware/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.naldotech.com/xiaomi-poco-f3-bloatware/" target="_blank">this article</a> that explains step by step. </p>



<p>Here is the list of apps that I deleted from my phone.</p>

<p>As you can see, I put alternatives for some deleted apps because they are essential to read e-mails, browse the internet or your photo gallery. I listed Micorosft alternative for Google applications, you can ignore them if you are dependent on Google services. I mostly use Microsoft applications in my daily routine, so I didn’t want to have duplication of the same application from Google. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, this list doesn’t cover all installed bloatware because some applications are breaking the phone if you remove them. For example, I couldn’t manage to uninstall Security Center, Find Device service, and POCO Launcher. I really wanted to replace POCO Launcher with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher" target="_blank">my favourite Android launcher</a>, but it has not been possible so far. When you remove POCO Launcher, it breaks the Recent Apps button’s functionality and it stops working. Uninstalling the Security Center application (com.miui.securitycenter) or the Find Device service (com.xiaomi.finddevice) puts the phone in a boot loop. </p>



<p>In addition, when you get a new system update, you may find some uninstalled applications come back, thus I would suggest to keep the list of uninstalled applications to remove them again easily.</p>



<p>I noted some commands below that you may also find useful. </p>



<pre><code># List all installed packages
pm list packages


# List all installed and uninstalled apps
pm list packages -u

# Disable app
pm disable-user app.package.name

# Re-enable it
pm enable app.package.name

# Uninstall app
pm uninstall --user 0 app.package.name

# Install uninstalled app
pm install-existing app.package.name

#Enable ADB via Network
adb tcpip 5555

#Disable ADB Network
adb usb

# Diff Files
# It is usefull to compare output between (pm list packages) and (pm list packages -u), so you can keep the uninstalled apps list easily.
diff --changed-group-format=&#39;%&gt;&#39; --unchanged-group-format=&#39;&#39; new_packages.txt  all_packages.txt</code></pre>

      <title>Looking into Zig</title>
      <link>https://ayende.com/blog/194404-A/looking-into-zig</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I think that it was the Pragmatic Programmer that recommend that you should learn a new language a year. For me, in 2020 that was Rust. I read a bunch of books about the language, I read significant amount of code and wrote some non trivial amount of code in Rust. That was sufficient to get me to grok the language, I’m not a Rust developer by any mean, but I walked with Rusty shoes for long enough to get the feeling.</p><p>This year, I decided to look into <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. Both Zig and Rust are more or less in the same space, replacing C. They couldn’t be more different, however. Zig is a small language. I spent a couple of evenings going through the language reference and that was it, I had a pretty good idea about how to do things.</p><p>The learning curve is mostly flat, and that is pretty huge. This is especially because I can’t help but compare Zig to Rust. I spent a <em>lot</em> of effort understanding Rust, but I had spent almost no cycles trying to grok Zig. It was simple, obvious and quite clear.  In terms of power, mind, I would rate both languages on roughly the same spot. You can write <em>really nice</em> code in Zig, it is just that you don’t need to bend your head into funny shapes to get the compiler to accept your code. </p><p>One of the key features for Zig is its <em>comptime</em> feature. This is a feature that allow Zig to run code at compilation time. That isn’t a new or exciting feature, to be honest, C++ had it for many years. The key difference is that Zig can use this feature for <em>code generation</em>. For example, to create a generic list, you’ll write the following code:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Note that we are writing here a function that returns a <em>type</em>, which you can then use. That approach is incredibly powerful, but at the same time, this is <em>simple</em>, it is <em>obvious</em>. </p><p>Zig is easy to learn, because there isn’t a whole lot more that is hidden from you behind the scenes.</p><p>That actually leads to another really important aspect in the design of Zig. There isn’t anything behind the scenes. For example, you cannot allocate memory in Zig, there is no global function that will do that for you. You need to do so using an allocator. That means that the fact that memory allocations can fail is pervasive throughout the API, standard library and your code. There isn’t a &#34;<em>this may fail on rare occasions</em>” scenario that you somehow need to handle, this is clear and in your face.</p><p>At the same time, Zig does a lot more to make things easier than C. I want to focus on a few important points:</p><ul><li>Zig has the concept of Errors. In the code above, the function <em>push()</em> may fail because of an allocation failure. In this case, the function will fail with a return code. That is handled by the <em>try</em> keyword, which will abort the current function and return the error. Note that errors and regular values are separate channels in Zig (there is a union mark with ! at the function declaration).</li><li>Zig has support for <SPAN color="#0000ff">defer</SPAN> and <SPAN color="#0000ff">errdefer</SPAN> keyword. The defer keyword works just as you would expect it to, at the function exit, it will run all the deferred statement in reverse order. The errdefer is a lot more interesting, because that will only run if the function exits with an error. This seemingly simple change has a huge impact on the code quality and the complexity that a developer need to keep in their head.</li><li>Zig has built-in testing, to the point where <em>test</em> is a keyword in the language.</li></ul><p>To give you some context, when I was writing C code, I literally wrote the exact same thing (manually, with macros and nastiness) in order to help me <a href="https://github.com/ayende/libgavran/blob/master/include/gavran/infrastructure.h#L74">get things done</a>. </p><p>In the same manner, the fact that allocation are explicit and managed from the top (all types that needs to allocate gets the allocator from their parents) means that you get to do some really cool things with memory. It is <em>easy</em> to say something like “this piece of code gets 10MB of memory only” and let it run like that. It also end up creating a more robust software system, I think, so memory allocations happen aren’t a rare occurrence, they happen all the time.</p><p>In general, Zig feel like a lot better C, no additional mental overhead. Compared to Rust, you can get working almost immediately and the compilation speed is <em>excellent</em>, to the point where you don’t really need to think about it. Rust makes you feel the slow compilation cost from the get go, basically, which is noticeable as your system grows bigger. </p><p>Thinking about this, I actually feel that we should compare Zig to Go, because it is closer in concept to what I think Go wanted to be. In fact, looking at the most common complaints people has against Go, Zig answers them all.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed, I’m quite enjoying working with Zig.</p><p>And as an aside, the fact that a language can implement a language server and get automatic IDE support is <em>freaking amazing</em>. You can also debug Zig code inside VS Code, for example, pretty much with no more issues than you would for native code. Zig is implemented on top of LLVM and gains a lot of the benefits from it. </p><p>One thing that kept going through my mind when I looked at all that I got out of the package is: standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

      <title>Whistleblowers expose corruption in EPA Chemical Safety Office</title>
      <link>https://theintercept.com/2021/07/02/epa-chemical-safety-corruption-whistleblowers/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="229"><div data-reactid="230"><p><u>Managers and career staff</u> in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention tampered with the assessments of dozens of chemicals to make them appear safer, according to four scientists who work at the agency. The whistleblowers, whose jobs involve identifying the potential harms posed by new chemicals, provided The Intercept with detailed evidence of pressure within the agency to minimize or remove evidence of potential adverse effects of the chemicals, including neurological effects, birth defects, and cancer.</p>
<p>On several occasions, information about hazards was deleted from agency assessments without informing or seeking the consent of the scientists who authored them. Some of these cases led the EPA to withhold critical information from the public about potentially dangerous chemical exposures. In other cases, the removal of the hazard information or the altering of the scientists’ conclusions in reports paved the way for the use of chemicals, which otherwise would not have been allowed on the market.</p></div><div data-reactid="241"><p>This is the first of a series of articles based on the four whistleblowers’ highly detailed allegations, which were supported by dozens of internal emails with supervisors, meeting summaries, and other documents. Together, the evidence they provided shows a pattern in which the EPA failed to follow the law that oversees chemical regulation, particularly the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, and depicts a workplace in which EPA staffers regularly faced retribution for following the science.</p>
<p>“The Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is broken,” the scientists wrote in a statement they provided to The Intercept and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. “The entire New Chemicals program operates under an atmosphere of fear — scientists are afraid of retaliation for trying to implement TSCA the way Congress intended, and they fear that their actions (or inactions) at the direction of management are resulting in harm to human health and the environment.”</p></div><!-- react-empty: 242 --><div data-reactid="243"><p>The four EPA staff members, who hold doctorates in toxicology, chemistry, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry, said that they told colleagues and supervisors within the agency about the interference with their work. Each of the scientists also filed complaints with either the EPA’s inspector general or the Office of Science Integrity, which has pledged to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/26/epa-corruption-cleanup/">investigate corruption</a> within the agency. But because most of their concerns remained unaddressed months after they disclosed them — and because, in each case, the altering of the record presented a potential risk to human health — the scientists said they felt compelled to make their complaints public.</p>
<h3>Maybe the Hazards Will Go Away</h3>
<p>Elyse Osterweil, one of the four scientists, said she was at first reluctant to speak up about the intense pressure she faced from her supervisors to remove references to potential toxicity from the assessments of new chemicals. The assessments, which use animal studies to gauge a chemical’s potential risk to humans, can lead the agency to place limits on its use — or to ban it entirely. In the case of one substance that Osterweil was reviewing in February of this year, the animal studies suggested serious potential for harm. Rats exposed to a single dose of the chemical had become lethargic, lost weight, and had trouble moving. Some became comatose, and others died.</p>
<p>“Usually with this type of acute study, there are no effects,” said Osterweil. “So this was a red flag to me that we needed further information.” But when Osterweil said in a meeting that she needed more data to complete her hazard assessment report, one of her supervisors responded with a series of questions. “She kept asking me, ‘Look at the data, look at the data, look at it again, tell me what you see,’” Osterweil said of her supervisor. “I knew she wanted me to make the hazards go away, and she even said that: ‘Why don’t you take a look at the actual study data again, and maybe the hazards will go away?’”</p>
<p>Although she knew she didn’t have enough information to say that the chemical didn’t pose a risk, Osterweil seriously considered giving in to the pressure to deem it safe. “There was a time when I thought, ‘Well, maybe I should let this one go and just pick my battles,’” she said. “But I just couldn’t.”</p>
<p>A chemist named Martin Phillips faced similar pushback when he was assessing a mixture of compounds in January of 2020. One component of the product, which was to be used in cleaning solutions, is a chemical that caused birth defects and miscarriage in experiments on rats. Phillips and another risk assessor noted the developmental effects in the chemical’s hazard assessment, which must by law then be added to the chemical’s safety data sheet, a document the Occupational Safety and Health Administration uses to communicate risk to workers. But the company that had submitted the product for approval balked at the requirement. And the day after the assessment Phillips wrote was finalized, a representative of the company who had recently worked in the same division of the EPA met with several of Phillips’s colleagues and his supervisor, whom she had known from her time at the agency. Phillips wasn’t invited to attend the meeting. The following day, another assessment of the chemical was uploaded into the EPA’s computer system without Phillips’s consent or knowledge. The new version omitted the information about the birth defects and miscarriages.</p>
<p>When he learned of the new assessment, Phillips asked that the original one be restored. The meeting that followed was hostile, with a senior science adviser in the office calling Phillips “passive aggressive” for being so concerned about the assessment. While some information about the chemical was restored in the assessment after Phillips complained about its removal, the warning about its potential to cause developmental toxicity, which would alert pregnant people to these harms, never made it into the safety data sheet.</p>
<p>Phillips had his work revised without his knowledge on other occasions too. In one case in 2019, he was asked to assess a chemical even though the manufacturer had not submitted studies. Phillips followed the EPA’s written guidance for such situations and used toxicity numbers for the class to which the chemical belongs. When he plugged in the proper values, Phillips calculated that the likely exposures to the chemical would exceed the agency’s safety limit by more than 15,000 times. Three months after he submitted the document with this conclusion, he noticed that a new assessment of the chemical had been uploaded to the EPA’s computer system. In this new assessment, which deviated from guidelines, the assessor found that the chemical posed only a slight risk and that workers who used the material could mitigate the danger by wearing protective gear.</p>
<p>The second assessment, which found the chemical not likely to pose harm, was finalized in August of 2020. “So it went from being over 15,000 times over the safe dose to you just need to wear a dust mask and you’ll be fine,” said Phillips.</p>
<h3>Siding with the Company</h3>
<p>All four scientists said the pressure to downplay the risk of chemicals increased during their time in the division. “We started getting increasing pressure to use the wrong exposure metrics,” said Sarah Gallagher, who joined the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, which is within Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, in May 2019. (The Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is also home to the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/30/epa-pesticides-exposure-opp/">Office of Pesticide Programs</a>.)</p>
<p>Gallagher protested changes in multiple risk assessments between March and June of 2020. Her supervisors asked her to represent the developmental effects of one chemical, which included the reduction of fetal weight in animal studies, as effects on pregnant rats themselves rather than direct effects on the fetus. Such a mischaracterization would mean that the risk the chemical poses to a developing human fetus would not be reflected by its safety data sheet. Gallagher refused to make the change.</p></div><div data-reactid="251"><p>One month later, she was reassigned to another office.</p>
<p>Even after her transfer, documents she had written while in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention continued to be altered, including an assessment of a <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/">PFAS compound</a>. Because there was limited information available about the chemical, she had looked to studies of similarly structured compounds, as is EPA policy. In this case, one of the closest analogues was <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-teflon-toxin/">PFOA</a>, an industrial chemical that poses both cancer and developmental risks, as Gallagher noted in her assessment. But one of her former supervisors had instructed another scientist to remove her reference to PFOA from the assessment and replace it with another, less toxic chemical to gauge its safety. The change resulted in a 33-fold underestimation of the compound’s risk, according to Gallagher.</p>
<p>William Irwin, another of the four whistleblowers, who has worked at the EPA for over 11 years as a toxicologist, was also moved out of the office after repeatedly resisting pressure to change his assessments to favor industry. Irwin said that while it had seemed obvious that the pressure stemmed from chemical companies, the science adviser in the office made the point irrefutably clear during an argument over one particular chemical assessment.</p>
<p>“At one point, he was shouting at me to change it,” Irwin said of the science adviser, who was urging him to eliminate hazards noted in the assessment. “He basically was siding with the company, shouting at me that ‘the company went apeshit when they saw this document.’” Irwin replied, “Well, that’s the assessment.”</p></div><blockquote data-reactid="252"><span data-reactid="253"></span><p>“He basically was siding with the company.”</p></blockquote><div data-reactid="255"><p>Irwin didn’t make the changes. “I actually added extra hazards to it,” he said. “It was also a carcinogen.” Several months after that encounter, the antagonism stopped when Irwin was transferred out of the office. The scientist saw the move as a last resort for his managers. “I have three board certifications in toxicology, so it was hard for them to say, ‘William, you’re stupid,’ and so instead they just kicked me out of the program.”</p>
<p>Phillips was also transferred in September 2020. Meanwhile, Osterweil continues to work in the office, where she said disputes over chemical assessments and retaliation against her have continued unabated.</p>
<p>The ongoing issues are evidence that the pressures on chemical assessors within the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention have persisted even under the Biden administration, according to Kyla Bennett, director of science policy at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, or PEER, an organization that provides support to whistleblowers and helped the scientists draft their disclosure document. “The problems in OCSPP are not due solely to the Trump administration and its appointees,” said Bennett. “The issues faced by our clients occurred before Trump took office, during the Trump years, and continue now.”</p>
<p>On Monday, PEER submitted its complaint to the EPA inspector general; Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention; and Khanna, asking that they conduct an audit to identify risk assessments that were altered without the knowledge or consent of the risk assessor; investigate apparent violations of the EPA’s records management policy, in which documents were altered; and evaluate the process that allowed these changes to be made and remain uncorrected.</p>
<p>Khanna provided a statement to The Intercept applauding the whistleblowers. “Clean, cancer-free air and water still isn’t a given in our country,” Khanna wrote. “I will continue to monitor this situation and ensure that these scientists’ concerns are addressed to ensure that toxic or harmful chemicals are not going out to the market without the appropriate health and safety warnings. I am so proud of the work of our Environmental Subcommittee is doing to create a healthier world.”</p>
<p>Asked about the complaint, the EPA wrote in an email that “This Administration is committed to investigating alleged violations of scientific integrity. It is critical that all EPA decisions are informed by rigorous scientific information and standards. As one of his first acts as Administrator, Administrator Regan issued a memorandum outlining concrete steps to reinforce the agency’s commitment to science.</p>
<p>“EPA takes seriously all allegations of violations of scientific integrity. EPA’s scientific integrity official and scientific integrity team members will thoroughly investigate any allegation of violation of EPA’s scientific integrity policy that they receive and work to safeguard EPA science. Additionally, EPA is currently reviewing agency policies, processes, and practices to ensure that the best available science and data inform Agency decisions. EPA is committed to fostering a culture of evaluation and continuous learning that promotes an open exchange of differing scientific and policy positions. Additionally, retaliation against EPA employees for reporting violations alleged to have occurred will not be tolerated in this administration. EPA leadership are reviewing these complaints, and any appropriate action will be taken.”</p>
<p>While such complaints are usually kept confidential, by Tuesday many mangers in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention had somehow obtained a copy of the whistleblowers’ allegations. “The fact that EPA released our clients’ names is inappropriate and troubling,” said Bennett. “They’ve been put in an incredibly uncomfortable situation. This gives the managers the chance to circle the wagons trying to go after them.”</p>
<p>For the whistleblowers, the release of their names is just the latest battle in a war they’ve been waging for years. For Gallagher, a scientist with expertise in chemistry and toxicology, the combative turn of her career has been a surprise. “Like a lot of us who are in this, we came to work at the EPA because I wanted to preserve the environment for our children’s children,” said Gallagher. “It’s infuriating that I have to push back against managers to do that.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is definitely going too far, and I would have to end our advisory relationship,» she wrote. He should «tone down his political expression immediately», she added. She had «no desire to receive emails like this because of one of my doctoral students.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrd0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber had to read the message twice. He had been tweeting for just 10 days, and had fewer than 10 followers. No question, he had been harshly critical of the Chinese government. For example, on March 21, he had posted, in English: «#CCP made fighting #COVID-19 plan B. Only to be executed if Plan A – covering it up – fails. Those are the actions of paranoid cowards. They neither deserve my respect nor gratitude #ChinaLiedPeopleDied».</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fc12sa0q1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Yet the student was shocked. This was supposed to be «neo-Nazi-like» content? He was sure there had been a misunderstanding. He replied at 11:11 p.m., wanting to know who the «angry emails from China» were from. He asked if his professor had even read the tweets, and accused her of having been «taken in by Chinese government’s increasingly aggressive censorship.» Still, he deactivated his Twitter account.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrf0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">He didn’t hear anything more for almost 48 hours. Then the professor got back to him. Her tone was distant, and she didn’t respond to Gerber&#39;s questions. She had copied his second doctoral adviser on this email, writing that she wished him good luck with his «Chinese studies». However, there was at that time «no supervisory relationship between you and us,» the message read. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrf1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">It was the last email Gerber would receive though his St. Gallen account. The next day, he found he couldn’t access his messages. An IT technician told him on the phone that his account didn’t exist. «It felt like I had been purged overnight,» Gerber said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrg0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Education is a key aspect of China&#39;s global power strategy. The Chinese government wants to control the country’s image throughout the world. To this end, it exerts influence abroad, and has no compunction about engaging in repressive actions. At the beginning of this year, for example, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/international/china-verhaengt-sanktionen-gegen-europa-was-bezwecken-sie-ld.1608345">banned all researchers</a> from Europe’s largest research institute specializing in China from entering the country. Such demonstrations of power intimidate researchers around the world – especially if they depend on traveling to China for work. This can lead them to preemptively avoid topics that could be perceived as critical of the Chinese government.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbp7q0vt1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">With more than 50 cooperation agreements currently in place, Swiss and Chinese universities today have close ties. Swiss researchers benefit from stays abroad, and are granted access to large amounts of data that proves useful in their work, for example in the development of cancer therapies. But what is the price of this cooperation?</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidro0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Only a few people in Switzerland have sought to disclose and criticize Chinese attempts to influence universities here. However, Gerber&#39;s case demonstrates that China&#39;s aggressive foreign policy can in fact influence how academics in Switzerland publicly express themselves, and how they deal with critical comments from their students. It shows that some researchers are willing to restrict their own and others’ activities in order to avoid upsetting China.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbouggon0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Oliver Gerber is not in fact the student’s real name. Because his partner&#39;s family lives in China and fears retaliation if his name appears in the newspaper, he asked to remain anonymous. For this reason, the professor too has not been mentioned by name. However, the NZZ has spoken directly with both sides. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidro1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber accuses St. Gallen of kicking him out because of his critical tweets. The NZZ has copies of these tweets, as well as Gerber&#39;s correspondence with the professor and other St. Gallen representatives. They largely support the position taken by the former Ph.D. student. However, the University of St. Gallen insists on a different version of events. According to this telling, Gerber himself decided to terminate his studies at the university.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrp0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">How does St. Gallen justify this? From whom did the professor receive the «angry emails from China»? And what does this mean for academic freedom and freedom of expression in Switzerland?</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrq0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The backstory</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfo90" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber has a background in the natural sciences. You can tell this by the way he tells his story: structured, meticulously documented and with a certain distance. As though it had all happened to someone else.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fboo3d7b1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Nonetheless, he betrays his continued preoccupation with the events by how often he repeats the sentence «I can&#39;t believe something like this happened in Switzerland.» And no wonder: his three years of research have been destroyed because of a tweet.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfoa0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber began his doctoral studies at St. Gallen in the spring of 2017. His research was in the field of environmental pollution. His topic was a delicate one for China, yet it was clear to Gerber early on that he wanted to understand the country, and wanted to do research on the ground, not just from a desk in St. Gallen. He applied for grants, supported in this effort by his adviser. In her letter of recommendation, she wrote: «He is capable of pursuing a first-rate research career.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbok69o81" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">He ultimately received a fellowship from the Chinese government to a university in Wuhan, for three years instead of just one, as originally planned. In September 2018, he flew to Wuhan, quickly made friends and fell in love. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fboo58611" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">A Chinese professor there told him that his Ph.D. topic was «boring» – a euphemism for being too critical of the government. As a part of his fellowship, he also had to attend classes, and says today he couldn’t believe how much censorship took place in the course of everyday university life. When he submitted an essay on reeducation camps, he received the lowest grade possible. In an email to his professor in St. Gallen, he wrote: «Maybe I&#39;ve just been unlucky.»</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfh36s0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">Gerber met his girlfriend during his research stay in China.

In 2018, almost half a million foreign students were studying in the country. Just under 13% had received a scholarship or other funding from the Chinese government. In offering such assistance, China specifically selects students from countries in which it has political interests.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmp1ed11" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">China&#39;s economy is growing rapidly. The country is becoming increasingly aggressive in its foreign policy. Western media routinely report on human rights violations such as the prison camps in Xinjiang. All of this raises fears about China. The government is aware of this.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbp9tok91" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">But it also knows that many people are fascinated by China&#39;s history. To feed this interest, China created the Confucius Institutes. There are more than 500 of these facilities worldwide, in over 150 countries. Located on the campuses of foreign universities, the institutes are tasked with providing Chinese language instruction and teach students about the country’s culture. They report to the Chinese Ministry of Education, which provides personnel and funds. There is only one such institute left in Switzerland, at the University of Geneva. A second was based at the University of Basel, but this was closed last autumn. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfol0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In the United States too, a quarter of the country’s Confucius Institutes have been shut down in recent years. Universities no longer wanted to give legitimacy to an institution that defended fundamentally different values. While research freedom and the freedom of expression are important fundamental principles in the West, education in China is highly politicized under the rule of Xi Jinping, the head of state and the Chinese Communist Party’s leader . For example, the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai has replaced the term «freedom of expression» in its statutes with a reference to «Xi Jinping&#39;s socialist ideology.»</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfol1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The momentous decision</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfon0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Just before Christmas 2019, Gerber flew back to Switzerland, originally planning no more than a short family visit. But then the coronavirus pandemic broke out. On January 23, 2020, a strict lockdown was imposed in Wuhan. Gerber stayed in Switzerland. At the time, he was starting to think about what to do after finishing his doctorate, and his girlfriend advised him to start networking on social media.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfoq0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">However, before Gerber opened his Twitter account, he sought advice from his professor, knowing that she was active on the social network. He asked via email: «Do you engage in some degree of self-censorship? Do you think it would be too dangerous for me to open a Twitter account?»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfor0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Although he received no response, he began tweeting in mid-March. At this point, the world was focused on China as the site of the coronavirus pandemic’s initial outbreak. Gerber saw an opportunity to position himself as a China expert. At the same time, he was also emotionally affected by what was happening in Wuhan – a city to which he wanted to return, and where he had friends and a partner. His Twitter channel became an outlet for these feelings, and he criticized the Chinese government&#39;s initial cover-up of the Corona epidemic, the repression in Xinjiang and Xi Jinping himself.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfos0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">His girlfriend was shocked when she saw some of the tweets. Talking with him on the telephone, she begged him to stop. Not because she necessarily disagreed with anything. But because she was worried about retaliation by the Chinese government. «I&#39;m in Switzerland, not China,» Gerber replied. «I can say what I want here.»</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfot0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>Swiss universities and their China connection</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmpck301" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Cooperation between Chinese and Swiss universities has expanded in recent years. The University of St. Gallen has 15 such agreements, almost twice as many as ETH Zurich. For the last eight years, St. Gallen has also been home to a «China Competence Center,» the aim of which is to «strengthen and deepen productive relations with China». Asked about the issue, a St. Gallen representative indicated that the institution has never encountered any problems in its relationships with Chinese universities. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfov0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In a report issued last year, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/63412.pdf">Swiss intelligence service</a> warned that Chinese spies might be masquerading as students or researchers. The issue of links between Swiss universities and China was also recently taken up in the Swiss parliament. Two parliamentarians submitted official queries to the government asking about the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20213288">principles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20213289">guidelines</a> governing these cooperative university relationships. The Federal Council, the seven-member executive body that heads Switzerland’s federal government, replied that universities had to decide for themselves what cooperative ventures they pursued. In the response, it added that there had been no «concrete reports of influence in terms of curtailing academic freedoms.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfp20" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p"><a href="https://www.nzz.ch/folio/ich-weiss-nicht-auf-welcher-seite-jemand-steht-ld.1623226">Ralph Weber</a>, a China expert and professor at the University of Basel, is critical of Swiss universities for often failing to perform sufficient due diligence on their foreign partners – especially those from China. In some sectors of the economy, he notes, it is normal procedure to examine the constraints under which a partner operates when it comes to important business. «I don’t see an approach like this being taken at many universities,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgk33g0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In Weber&#39;s view, clear rules – and above all red lines – are needed. Otherwise, he says, there is considerable risk that Swiss universities will simply say «This is China, there&#39;s no way around it,» and in doing so, compromise their own values. However, Swiss universities seem to have recognized the problem. Under the auspices of the main umbrella organization for Swiss universities, they are now for the first time seeking to develop joint guidelines for cooperative ventures with China.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgk33i0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The conflict<br/></span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri00" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">After Gerber read the email in which his professor wrote that there was no longer «a supervisory relationship,» he turned desperately to his father. His father in turn contacted a lawyer. That same evening, on the advice of his girlfriend, Gerber compiled a dossier of emails between himself and his most important contacts at St. Gallen. In the following weeks, his lawyer wrote several letters to the university administration. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfjt9a0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">After the first e-mail from his professor, Gerber still believed there had been a misunderstanding. The second email left him distraught.</h2> <!----></p></figcaption> <!----></figure> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbpbsnjd1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber&#39;s goal was to be able to continue studying at St. Gallen. But the university argued that the professor hadn’t kicked him out; rather, he had been deregistered at his own request quite some time ago. In fact, as of the fall 2019 semester, Gerber had been officially enrolled only at the university in China, not at St. Gallen. He had been advised to take this tack by the St. Gallen doctoral program manager. In an email, the manager had said this would ensure that the maximum time allowed for pursuit of the degree would not expire while Gerber was in China. «Deregistration allows you to keep all your options on the table,» the email had said. The reregistration process would be like applying all over again – but with the support of his professor, this would be no problem, the program manager said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri40" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber followed this advice and temporarily deregistered at St. Gallen. «A wise decision,» the program manager wrote. For the time being, however, Gerber was still listed as a doctoral student on the university&#39;s website. His professor continued to advise him as before – until the complaints about his tweet. For example, following a Skype meeting, she asked him to send her an outline of his work. On February 21, 2020, a few weeks before she declared the supervisory relationship to be nonexistent, she wrote: «It&#39;s great how well you&#39;ve already progressed in China!» <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri60" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber could document all of this. Yet throughout the spring of 2020, the university stuck to its position that when the trouble over his tweets broke out, he had long since ceased to be a St. Gallen doctoral student. For this reason too, the university&#39;s ombudsman declined to handle the case. The university informed Gerber that he would have to completely reapply if he wanted to continue studying at the institution. Moreover, he would have to find a new professor to advise him.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri70" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">For her part, it was only upon inquiries from the NZZ that the professor indicated which tweet the «angry emails from China» comment referred to, and who they had come from. She said she had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student doing research at a Canadian university. This email was made available to the NZZ, but the name of the sender was blacked out – at the request of the writer, according to the professor.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri80" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The writer accuses Gerber of a «racist attack on the Chinese people.» He was referring to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user&#39;s tweet. It depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes. This drawing circulated on social media in the spring of 2020, and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber said he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The underlying topic had been China&#39;s stance toward Taiwan and Hong Kong. «In retrospect, I realize I didn&#39;t question the rendering of the Chinese person enough,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri90" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The professor said she had informed Gerber that he was no longer allowed to represent himself as a St. Gallen doctoral student on Twitter, because he had deregistered the previous year. «This has nothing whatsoever to do with the issues of China or censorship,» she said. She said it was only an oversight that she had used the plural in referring to «angry emails from China,» despite receiving only one email – and that one originating from Canada. She had wanted to make it clear that further reactions could be expected. The phrase «I would have to end our advisory relationship» had referred to the informal advice she had provided «at the doctoral student&#39;s request,» she said. The fact that Gerber had continued to be listed as a student on the St. Gallen website until the end of March was due simply to an oversight, she added.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkric0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The professor went on to explain that the relationship of trust had already been strained, because Gerber had «lost his temper» during a conversation a year earlier, and had told her that he no longer wanted to continue his doctorate at St. Gallen in any form, and no longer needed her as a doctoral supervisor. Gerber disputes this. He had at one time simply considered pursuing a dual degree from both universities, St. Gallen and the university in China, he said. In the emails between the two from 2019, which were obtained by NZZ, there is no hint of tension.</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfk8af0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">The professor wrote of «angry emails from China.» Later, she said that only one person had contacted her: a Chinese doctoral student from Canada.</h2> <!----></p></figcaption> <!----></figure> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbro92520" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Whether the professor received «angry emails from China», as she herself wrote, cannot be conclusively judged. However, it is clear that China can exert pressure through its visa issuance policy. The professor&#39;s first email clearly shows that she feared she would no longer be able to obtain a Chinese visa because of Gerber&#39;s tweets. That also explains the rapidity with which she cut off contact – regardless of the fact that Gerber immediately deactivated his Twitter profile. Were there additional economic interests at play? St. Gallen says that the professor&#39;s department has never received funding or other forms of support from Chinese companies or other Chinese actors.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrid0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The aftermath</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrif0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">How does St. Gallen see the case today? Vice-President of External Relations Ulrich Schmid said: «St. Gallen is unreservedly committed to the freedoms of teaching and research. However, the freedom of research is in no way implicated here, since the issue concerns private statements by the former doctoral student, which he published via a social network.» Schmid said he could not comment on the tweets. «However, the fact that they obviously generated considerable discussion, and were perceived as racist, justifies the professor&#39;s desire to distance herself clearly from them.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrih0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Schmid said the support provided to Gerber after his deregistration had been «purely voluntary,» and that it had an «informal character.» It was the professor&#39;s «clear right» to terminate this at any time if the relationship of trust was disturbed. Furthermore, Schmid said, Gerber had not submitted a complete application for his renewed enrollment, but had instead attempted to force his reenrollment. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrij0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In the early summer of 2020, Gerber decided to abandon the legal effort. He said he didn&#39;t complete the enrollment application because he couldn&#39;t find a new adviser: «There was no other professor in the same department with whom I could have finished my work. Changing topics would have meant starting from scratch again after three and a half years. That was out of the question for me.» <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrim0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The former student thought long and hard about whether to go public with his case. He now hopes for a debate on how China is influencing Swiss universities. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbonoue11" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Today, Gerber says starting to tweet was a mistake. The fact that he could lose three years of research work because of this still leaves him stunned. Yes, he was publicly critical of China, and once shared a cartoon that he would not share today. «But I didn’t do anything wrong,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fc39qfq41" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber has now given up pursuit of his doctorate. «I don&#39;t want to have to censor myself, certainly not in Switzerland,» he said. In the meantime, he has found a job that has nothing to do with China.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-footnote="" id="id-doc-1fbmmsmv30" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="footnote" data-vars-danzz-last-article-element="true">* Real name known to editors.</p> <!----><!---->  <!----><!----> <p data-team-footnote="" id="id-doc-1fc7u5ghv0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="footnote" data-vars-danzz-last-article-element="true">The NZZ is one of the preeminent news sources in the German-speaking world, with a tradition of independent, high-quality journalism reaching back over 240 years.</p> <!----></section>  <!---->  <!----> <!---->  <!----> <!----> <!----> </div></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Problem with Perceptual Hashes</title>
      <link>https://rentafounder.com/the-problem-with-perceptual-hashes/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Apple just <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">announced</a> that they will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing">“perceptual hashing”</a> to detect illegal photos on iPhones. I have some experience to share on this technology.</p>
<p>At my company, we use “perceptual hashes” to find copies of an image where each copy has been slightly altered. This is in the context of stock photography, where each stock agency (e.g. Getty Images, Adobe Stock, Shutterstock) adds their own watermark, the image file ID, or sharpens the image or alters the the colours slightly, for example by adding contrast. For our customers, i.e. the photographers who upload their photos to these agencies and sell them through their platform, we need to find all of their photos’ copies on those agencies. We use perceptual hashes to find them.</p>
<p>Most publicly documented perceptual hash algorithms work by reducing the image data to a bit vector (the “hash”) which is then compared to a database of hashes, typically by applying a distance metric, which is, in many casess the so-called Hamming Distance, the number of bits by which the two hashes differ. Image data reduction usually includes resizing the image, discarding its colour information, filtering in the frequency domain (often using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">DCT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet">Wavelets</a>), in some cases (supposedly the proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoDNA">PhotoDNA</a> algorithm) calculating a histogram of these values, and in <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf">Apple’s case</a> using a convolutional neural network to reduce image information to a floating point vector, then quantizing that vector into the final hash bits.</p>
<p>For our product, I’ve evaluated <a href="http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html">Average Hash</a>, <a href="https://www.phash.org/">pHash</a>, <a href="http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html">dHash</a>, and the algorithm described in the paper <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/mrquery.pdf">Fast Multiresolution Image Querying</a> which is also used in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imgseek/">imgSeek</a> software. We currently have to match approximately 100 million photos and found that the latter one worked best, i.e. it resulted in the fewest false positives and fewest false negatives. (I published a Golang implementation <a href="https://github.com/rivo/duplo">here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-problem">So What’s the Problem?</h3>
<p>None of these algorithms are waterproof. Let me give you an example of a false positive. We try to find a copy of the <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/de/221271979">following image</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best the algorithm could find was <a href="https://de.depositphotos.com/300295390/stock-photo-watercolor-heliconius-doris-butterfly.html">this image</a>:</p>

<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that these algorithms will fail sometimes. But in the context of 100 million photos, they do fail quite often. And they don’t fail in acceptable ways: It’s easy to see that the general composition of these two images is similar (beige background with dark accents in the top right center). But their content is completely different. The collisions encountered with other hashing algorithms look different, often in unexpected ways, but collisions exist for all of them.</p>
<p>When we deal with perceptual hashes, there is no fixed threshold for any distance metric, that will cleanly separate the false positives from the false negatives. In the example above, we can apply a stricter threshold but this will cause actual copies of many photos to go undetected. Simple modifications such as watermarks or slight colour corrections would lead to the algorithm concluding that “these two images are not the same”.</p>
<p>Especially when a Hamming Distance is used to compare hashes, there is not a lot of room to fine tune the threshold. Let’s assume we’re dealing with 256-bit hashes: The Hamming Distances for which two images are the same are likely within just a few bits, i.e. a Hamming Distance of, say, 16, will already indicate a lot of differences. In the context of millions of pictures, moving the Hamming Distance threshold up or down by one will have a huge effect on the number of false positives or false negatives generated.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-affect-apples-new-technology">How Does This Affect Apple’s New Technology?</h3>
<p>Even at a Hamming Distance threshold of 0, that is, when both hashes are identical, I don’t see how Apple can avoid tons of collisions, given the large number of pictures taken every year (<a href="https://blog.mylio.com/how-many-photos-will-be-taken-in-2021-stats/">1.4 trillion in 2021</a>, now break this down by iPhone market share and country, the number for US iPhone users will still be extremely big).</p>
<p>According to Apple, a low number of positives (false or not) will not trigger an account to be flagged. But again, at these numbers, I believe you will still get too many situations where an account has multiple photos triggered as a false positive. (Apple says that probability is “1 in 1 trillion” but it is unclear how they arrived at such an estimate.) These cases will be manually reviewed. That is, according to Apple, an Apple employee will then look at your (flagged) pictures. Does Apple have the manpower in place to iron out their algorithm’s shortcomings? We can only hope so.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Perceptual hashes are messy. The simple fact that image data is reduced to a small number of bits leads to collisions and therefore false positives. When such algorithms are used to detect criminal activities, especially at Apple scale, many innocent people can potentially face serious problems.</p>
<p>My company’s customers are slightly inconvenienced by the failures of perceptual hashes (we have a UI in place that lets them make manual corrections). But when it comes to CSAM detection and its failure potential, that’s a whole different ball game. Needless to say, I’m quite worried about this.</p>

<h2>Part I</h2>
<p><span>I want to kick this off with a confession: <strong>Richard Stallman</strong> has always been one of my heroes! Richard Matthew Stallman, also known as RMS, is considered one of the greatest hackers in computer history. The software he wrote in the 1970s is still being used in the present day. On the big screen, when we see a bearded hacker who spends his nights by his computer and sleeping on a bed next to it during the day – we’re actually looking at the mythological figure of Stallman, With his untidy beard and his long grayish hair. He was partly an inspiration for this cliché.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1599"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1599">Richard Stallman (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Stallman is also regarded as the father of the Open Source movement, a social-technological phenomenon that inspired the creation of many of the programs we use daily: the Android operating system, WordPress, the Firefox browser and many many others. By the way, Stallman very much <strong>doesn’t like to be called “the father of the Open Source movement.”</strong> We’ll get to that later in the show.</span></p>
<p><span>When I decided to write an entire episode about the history of the Open Source movement, I also took the opportunity to make an old dream come true by interviewing Richard Stallman himself.</span></p>
<p><span><em>[the phone rings, Richard picks up]</em></span></p>
<p><span>This interview – how should I put it – didn’t go as I had expected it. The conversation with him made me doubt a few of the premises regarding the world of technology, while illuminating sides of his personality that I never knew about.</span></p>
<h3><span>Richard Matthew Stallman</span></h3>
<p><span>Richard Stallman was born in the US in 1953. Even as a child, he demonstrated an <strong>anti-establishment</strong> attitude and rebelliousness. His behavioral problems made him switch schools every now and then, and that left him, socially, as a bit of an outsider among children his age. He even admits that he never learned how to get along properly with other people.</span></p>
<p><span>Computers, though, were a completely different story. Believe it or not, as an elementary student, Stallman read computer manuals and wrote software. Of course, it was the 1950s and 60s, days when computer access was a rare privilege – so the software he wrote was all on paper. Only in high school did he actually get to SEE a real computer, but at that point, he already knew computers much better than most teenagers. To say that Richard Stallman is <strong>a brilliant person</strong> is an understatement.</span></p>
<p><span>He studied physics at Harvard. Although he enjoyed the classes, there was one thing that upset him greatly. There weren’t many computer terminals in Harvard back then, and students were desperate for any computer time they could get. Many professors held computer terminals inside their offices – but they would often lock the doors at night. It was <strong>a huge waste</strong>: the terminals went unused for many hours, like precious electronic stones – while outside there were those who really, really wanted to use them.</span></p>
<h3>MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab</h3>
<p><span>Not far from Harvard is MIT, the world famous technological university. During his studies at Harvard, Stallman visited the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – where he witnessed <strong>a completely different attitude</strong>. At MIT, computer terminals were considered a common resource, and no one had a direct and distinct ownership over their machines. If one of the professors kept a computer terminal in his office and dared to lock the door behind him – the students would literally break open the door – sometimes with makeshift battering rams – and take the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was the home for many young students who were passionate about technology. At the time they were known as “<strong>hackers</strong>”, although the term had a slightly different meaning compared to today: Back then, “hackers” were those who liked to research deeply into the guts of any system and change it. It certainly did not have the negative connotation it holds today, of someone who steals information or does damage. The hackers of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory wanted to create interesting things using the tools they had, and they did not have any tolerance or patience towards those who tried to restrain them. For Stallman, this was<strong> love at first sight</strong> – and he quickly joined the lab.</span></p>
<h3>Hackers</h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/MIT_2012-07-18.jpg/320px-MIT_2012-07-18.jpg"></a><figcaption>MIT main campus (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Life at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was intense. The professors and their students used the lab during the day, and as soon as they left, the hackers took over and worked all night. They ordered Chinese food at three a.m. and continued working on their software until dropping onto folding beds to catch some sleep. Together with other programmers, Stallman developed software and ideas that are considered to be <strong>milestones in the history of modern technology</strong>. For example, he created an important algorithm for the artificial intelligence field, and a hugely popular text editor named Emacs.</span></p>
<p><span>Stallman loved every minute at the lab. When he graduated from Harvard – making the Dean’s list, of course – he registered for his master’s degree at MIT, mainly so he could continue working at the lab. He was enchanted by the comradery and the spirit of cooperation; the lab was a place where people worked together for a common cause and for the good of the public.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“The atmosphere was very wheeling and cooperative. We were using and developing our own operating system, which for me was the absolute ideal job. I was getting paid to do what I would absolutely love! I was doing this job as a part of a group of other developers without a sharp boundary. There were some other people who were also the staff at the lab, improving the system, but anyone was welcome to improve the system! We were happy to get contributions from anybody, and they didn’t even have to have a connection with MIT. We were happy when anybody else showed up and started using the system if he did anything that was thoughtful. And if they started to contribute to the system too – well, that was great! And we were happy to share our software with people outside MIT. We were glad when they thought it was useful.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>There was such transparency and openness within the lab, that people often <strong>read and answered each other’s e-mails</strong>. Stallman told the following story in a talk he gave in 1986:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I remember one interesting scandal where somebody sent a request for help in using [a certain program] that was developed at MIT. He sent to one of the people working on it a request for some help, and he got an answer a few hours later from somebody else. He was horrified, he sent a message “so-and-so must be reading your mail, can it be that mail files aren’t properly protected on your system?” “Of course, no file is protected on our system. What’s the problem? You got your answer sooner; why are you unhappy? Of course we read each other’s mail so we can find people like you and help them”. Some people just don’t know when they’re well off.”</span></em></p>
<hr/>

<h3><span>The Roots of GNU &amp; the Free Software Foundation</span></h3>
<p><span>But this ideal environment didn’t last forever, and MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was <strong>a victim of its own success</strong>. The majority of computer users during the 1950s and 60’s were from the academic world and they were used to sharing ideas – and software – with each other. But during the late 1970s, when computers began spreading in the business sector, many new companies developed proprietary software for industrial needs, and it was only natural that these companies offered their software to customers in exchange for a payment, instead of giving them away free. This signaled an end to the culture of free software exchange. These companies also offered very high salaries to the MIT hackers, whose talents were now in high demand. Within several years the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory became empty. Not physically, of course – professors and their students still used the facility, but the anarchist hackers were nowhere in sight.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Richard Stallman stayed at the lab, he soon realized that <strong>the spirit of the place had changed</strong>. The remaining programmers weren’t as thrilled to share knowledge and creative solutions with each other. In the brave new business world, knowledge was power. Knowledge was money. The high-quality software that programmers used to write for their own common use at the lab was replaced by mediocre and proprietary software; and as for reading other people’s e-mails, that was simply out of the question.</span></p>
<p><span>Stallman continued his daily tasks, but something inside him wished to rekindle the spark of the majestic atmosphere the lab once had. In the early 1980s Stallman found a way to do so, and the key to rekindling the spark was by “<strong>sharing</strong>.”</span></p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p><span>In the programming world, the word “sharing” has <strong>a deeper and more complex meaning</strong> than its daily use among the public. I’ll explain. Let’s assume that I am a chef at a restaurant. Tonight I’m making a wonderful dish of spaghetti Bolognese – my mother’s legendary recipe… I serve the dish to the table, and my guests simply cannot get enough of my spaghetti. You could say that I “shared” the dish with my guests – but that wouldn’t be completely true: I shared the dish, but I didn’t share the recipe. By not telling them how I made the spaghetti – I am preventing them from trying to make it themselves. Only by sharing my secret recipe will I give them something more meaningful than a delicious bowl of pasta; only by sharing the idea of spaghetti Bolognese and my mother’s special way of making it can they hope to recreate my dish, alter it, and create a new, perhaps even more delicious, dish than mine.</span></p>
<p><span>In the programming world, this ‘recipe’ is called the <strong>‘Source Code’</strong>: it is the specific list of instructions that the programmer created for the processor to execute. These instructions are then transformed, via a special process, to a regular software that we, the users, are familiar with. A game, for example, starts out as a long list of instructions. I can share with someone a copy of a game I wrote – just as sharing a dish of pasta – but only when I share the source code will it be considered “full sharing.” A programmer that will get access to my source code could understand the techniques and ideas I used, learn from them, and perhaps create a new and improved version of the game.</span></p>
<p><span>But that, of course, is exactly the reason why business companies <strong>refuse to share</strong> their software’s source code. A program’s source code is often considered to be a top industrial secret and is closely guarded, since what game company would want its competitors to develop an improved version of its game?</span></p>
<h3>A new Operating System</h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Heckert_GNU_white.svg/246px-Heckert_GNU_white.svg.png"></a><figcaption>The GNU Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Stallman knew that the key to creating a community of programmers, all sharing the same passion for technology and the will to contribute to a common cause, is by creating <strong>an environment of full cooperation</strong>, without secrets or restraints: meaning, the programmers needed to share the source code they are writing. In other words, this is exactly the difference between a group of people eating prepared food and having a not-so-interesting-conversation, to a group of chefs standing around the kitchen table, and passionately debating whether rosemary should be added to the dish, or rather oregano. Together they will create a wonderful and unique dish that otherwise would not have existed.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“But I wanted to create once again a community in which people would work together, contributing in the spirit of scientific cooperation, to making software for everyone to use. So I realized the only way we can have such a community is if we were using free software! We had to make sure all the software we were using was, if fact, free – and then we could have such a community. But there wasn’t sufficient free software, so that was my job. I had to bring into existence a free software operating system – but this time one for modern computers instead of 1968 computer design. So, that’s what I started to do. I announced the development of the GNU operating system, and asked the people to join and help.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>An <strong>operating system</strong> is a vital instrument in the process of creating new software; it is the foundation on which a software operates – just the same as roads, signs, and stoplights are the foundation of transportation. The most common and popular operating system at the time was <strong>Unix</strong>, and the majority of programmers were familiar with it. Unix was owned by AT&amp;T, and whoever wanted to use it had to pay the company. Stallman wanted to create an operating system that was similar to Unix – but one that was free, that is – not proprietary. In 1983 he released a statement in one of the online discussion groups and announced his new project: <strong>the GNU project</strong> – an endeavor to create a new, modern, operating system. The acronym GNU stands for: GNU is Not Unix. This is known as “recursive acronym,” because the letter “G” stands for the acronym itself.</span></p>
<p><span>A year later, in 1984, Richard Stallman left MIT in order to concentrate on his project and established an organization called the “Free Software Foundation” (FSF). He wanted to institutionalize the idea of “sharing” which was so common during the 1960s and 70’s and create a social movement with a clear ideology, a movement whose members support and assist each other. Needless to say, the ideology encouraged people to create and share “Free Software”.</span></p>
<h3><span>What is ‘Free Software’?</span></h3>
<p><span>Here’s Stallman’s definition of a ‘free software.’ Remember that programmers count from zero, not from 1…</span></p>
<p><em><span>“There’s a definition of ‘free software.’ A program is Free Software if it gives you, the user, the four essential freedoms. And these are:</span></em></p>
<p><span>It’s important to note that Stallman takes every opportunity to stress the fact that the word “free” in “Free Software” refers to “<strong>freedom</strong>” rather than “<strong>free of charge</strong>.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>“The word free has multiple meanings. When I use it, it means free as in freedom. I am careful that when I mean ‘zero price’ I never say free – I say Gratis because I want it to be clear what I mean.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Why does Stallman emphasize freedom as a main and vital characteristic of a software? In all the years I have been working as a software engineer, I have read countless books and articles about software engineering, all full of advice and techniques for creating a “good” piece of software – but the word freedom was never mentioned in any of them. So what makes it so important, according to Stallman?</span></p>
<h3>The Importance of Free Software</h3>
<p><span>Well, he believes <strong>sharing knowledge and ideas</strong> are the keys to innovation in software. A proprietary software, one where the user has no access to its source code, might be useful – but it contributes nothing to innovation; in fact, it even blocks it.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s assume that I am a programmer and that one day I realize that the software I am using – Microsoft’s Word, for example – could be significantly improved by adding some feature. This feature might be a major one – such as adding support for a new foreign language, or it might be a minor one, like adding a new icon. Since Microsoft won’t give me access to the source code of “Word,” there is no way for me to make those improvements. I could, of course, rewrite a better version of “Word”…<strong>but that’s not really practical</strong>. It would me years of work in order to create the software from scratch when all I wanted to do was add a single feature. This is a common example of how a lack of access to the program’s source code blocks innovation.</span></p>
<h3>A Struggle for Control</h3>
<p><span>The lack of freedom could also be harmful in other, less obvious ways.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“When a person spends a lot of time using a computer system, the configuration of that computer system becomes the city that he lives in. Just as the way our houses and furniture are laid out, determines what it’s like for us to live among them, so does the computer system that we use, and if we can’t change the computer system that we use to suit us, then our lives are really under the control of others. And a person who sees this becomes in a certain way demoralized: “It’s no use trying to change those things, they’re always going to be bad. No point even hassling it. I’ll just put in my time and … when it’s over I’ll go away and try not to think about it anymore”. That kind of spirit, that unenthusiasm is what results from not being permitted to make things better when you have feelings of public spirit.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Stallman views controlling a software as a part of a power struggle between common citizens and the powerful forces of society – <strong>a class struggle</strong> whose terminology is almost identical to older social ideologies like Marxism.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“If the users don’t have all of those freedoms, and they don’t fully control the program – which means it’s the program that controls the users, and the owner controls the program. So that program is an instrument that gives the owner power over the users. That’s why non-free software is an injustice. And this power is a constant temptation to the developers. Nowadays the ethical standards of the developers of proprietary software have gone down through the floor, and it’s standard practice to make non-free software spy on users, intentionally stop them from doing the things they want to do – this is called ‘DRM’, Digital Restrictions management – and there are also backdoors that accept commands from somebody else to do something to the user. And some proprietary software are platforms for censorship.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Stallman’s ideas regarding freedom and cooperation gained a lot of traction, and the <strong>Free Software movement became bigger and stronger.</strong> Its members organized conferences, published online magazines, and created group chats on the internet. Other programmers joined the movement in order to help him with the GNU project; which was more certainly needed since writing an operating system is a complex task that demands thousands of hours. But despite all the volunteering spirit, the cooperation and the help he got, in the early 1990s Stallman found himself facing a serious problem.</span></p>
<h3><span>The Hurd Kernel</span></h3>
<p><span>Roughly speaking, an operating system can be described as having two parts: a “<strong>kernel</strong>,” and an “<strong>envelope</strong>” (also known as “application layer”). The envelope holds the software that computer users work with, for example, a calculator, file explorer, or a drawing software. The kernel of an operating system is the part that connects software to the hardware – the processor, the memory, the disk, and more. If we think of an operating system as a theater play, then the envelope is the stage, and the kernel is the mechanism behind the scenes: the lighting technician, the set manager, make-up artist and all necessary service providers that are needed to run the show.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the kernel is often the most complicated part of the operating system, Stallman, and the Free Software Foundation members decided to write it last. When they were done with the envelope and were finally ready to write the kernel – it turned out that the task was even more complicated than they anticipated. The kernel, named ‘<strong>Hurd</strong>‘, was <strong>too complicated and unstable</strong>, and at a certain point it was clear to everyone that it had no hope of replacing the popular operating system “Unix.”</span></p>
<p><span>The GNU project was <strong>stuck in a technological quicksand</strong> that threatened the entire Free Software movement: although the envelope was ready, there was no kernel – and without an operating system, it is impossible to write free software – and writing free software was the whole point.</span></p>
<h3><span>Linux Joins Project GNU</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/204px-Tux.svg.png"></a><figcaption>The Linux Mascot</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Help came from an unexpected source. In August 1991, a young Finnish student named <strong>Linus Benedict Torvalds</strong>, posted a message on one of the group chats:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Hello, everybody out there using minix [an operating system]–</span></em></p>
<p><span>Despite his modesty, Torvalds’ amateur operating system was a source of interest to many programmers, who helped him improve and expand it. It was later named “<strong>Linux</strong>” – a combination of his name, “Linus” and “Unix.”</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned, Richard Stallman was just looking for a suitable replacement for Hurd, the failing kernel of the GNU project, and found Linux to be very interesting. The Linux operating system was completely new and therefore didn’t contain any code from Unix or other proprietary software – a necessary demand for any free software. At first, Stallman was reluctant about using Linux since Torvalds announced that his operating system could only support a certain type of computer known as AT. This meant that Linux was limited to only one computer model and hence was not completely “free”. But two years later, when <strong>Stallman realized the advantages</strong> of Linux’s technology, he changed his mind and Linux replaced Hurd as the kernel of GNU operating system. Since then, the operating system is called <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> – to denote that the envelope is GNU while the Kernel is Linux.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“You shouldn’t exaggerate that. Basically, we tried to develop lots of programs, and some of them we succeeded, and some of them we didn’t. The important thing is that we did get a free kernel because someone wrote one.”</span></em></p>
<h3>A Trojan Horse</h3>
<p><span>Adding Linux gave the GNU project <strong>a powerful tailwind</strong>. Linux was a very successful kernel, and together with the software developed by Stallman and his colleagues, it created a strong, sophisticated, and reliable operating system that proved the validity of Stallman’s ideas – that full cooperation of knowledge and ideas could produce quality software to compete against proprietary software sold by Microsoft and others. Many new members joined the Free Software movement, and Richard Stallman’s reputation as the prophet of this new and exciting movement was accordingly established.</span></p>
<p><span>But even though Linux was an important addition to the GNU project, it also turned out to be somewhat of a Trojan horse. The significant changes Linux created, or to be more accurate – the changes brought about by the young programmers it attracted – were about to create <strong>a serious rift</strong> within the young community of the Free Software movement. This rift and its consequences will be the focus of our next episode. We will talk about the split that occurred in the Free Software movement which led to the establishment of the open Source movement. We will also answer the question – why is Google trying to kill Android? And we will also get to know Richard Stallman better – what does the guru think of modern software technology? You might be surprised to find out that he hardly ever uses it.</span></p>
<h2><span>Part II</span></h2>
<p><span>In the previous episode, I introduced Richard Stallman, one the greatest hackers in computer history, whose bearded figure became iconic as the character of the Hollywood computer hacker. Stallman is also one of my biggest heroes – he has been an inspiration to me from the moment I realized I wanted to be an engineer.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Richard Stallman is admired by many, he is also considered to be… <strong>not an easy-going person</strong>, to say the least. I had a taste of this myself while trying to schedule a phone interview with him. As early as the first e-mail correspondence between us, Stallman demanded that I specifically note in the interview that Linux is a part of the GNU project (Or, to put it more accurately: GNU uses Linux as part of its software suite) and that I would refer to it by its full name: <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>. If I didn’t agree – no interview. He also demanded that I make a clear distinction between “Free Software” and “Open Source” – a distinction we will get to later on. Again, If I didn’t agree – no interview. Both are legitimate and even important requests, of course – but I got the sense that Stallman is a man who takes his ideas and ideals very very seriously… And lastly – Stallman requested that the episode will be distributed in a copyright-free format such as <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong> and that the podcast’s website will not use any proprietary technology like Javascript. He did agree to compromise on some of the demands when I explained that the website will not work without Javascript.</span></p>
<h3>The Man Who Called Me a Fool</h3>
<p><span>Stallman took upon himself the role of a “<strong>counterweight</strong>” to all users who prefer the comfort offered by proprietary software over the freedom of free software.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Like, there might be somebody who wants to talk to you using Skype. Now, Skype is a proprietary program and we know it’s malware. So if you put it on your computer you’re surrendering your freedom.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>At this point, I was wondering whether I should tell Richard that I’m calling him via skype…</span></p>
<p><em><span>“It’s the act of a fool!”</span></em></p>
<p><span>On second thought, <strong>maybe I shouldn’t</strong>.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“People who really value freedom tell others ‘No!, no I won’t have Skype on my computer, no I won’t use Skype because if I’m using it then someone else is using it because of me, and I’m not going to encourage someone else to surrender freedom by doing that. But, that takes moral courage! It takes moral courage and our society doesn’t promote moral courage.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>A short visit to Stallman’s website gives a general clue about his <strong>militant character</strong>: the website is full of slogans and calls for activism, such as a call to resist oil drilling in the North Pole, a call to boycott Facebook due to its privacy issues, to boycott Apple, Amazon, the patent system, and even boycott Harry Potter since Stallman believes that J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry potter books, is too greedy.</span></p>
<h3><span>An Abomination</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Linus_Torvalds.jpeg/176px-Linus_Torvalds.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Linus Torvalds (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In 1996, Stallman and his colleagues at the Free Software Foundation held a conference. The main speaker was <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>. Interestingly enough, even though Torvalds contributed to the GNU project by letting Stallman use his operating system, he did not share Stallman’s ideas and ideology. Of course, he was thrilled to assist the GNU project –but unlike Stallman, Torvalds was <strong>more interested in the technological aspects</strong> of software engineering and operating systems, rather than the social aspects. On stage, Torvalds gave a speech where he said, among other things, that he loves using Powerpoint, Microsoft’s presentation software.</span></p>
<p><span>For Stallman and his supporters, Torvalds’ words were nothing but <strong>blasphemy</strong>. They considered Powerpoint an abomination: a proprietary software by a company known for its ruthless business ethics. Using PowerPoint?!… Who would do such a thing?!</span></p>
<p><span>Yet the message Torvalds put forth in his speech – intentionally or unintentionally – <strong>hit a sensitive spot</strong> among the younger crowd. At that point, the Free Software Foundation was over a decade old and many of its younger members grew up in a world much different than the world Stallman grew up in. During the 1960s and 70s, when computers were found mostly in academic institutions, free software was the norm while proprietary software was relatively rare. Torvalds’ generation grew up in the 1980s and 90s when having a computer at home wasn’t unheard-of. Proprietary software was all around, while free software was now rare. Of course, everyone believed in freedom and cooperation – but if you like a certain software and think it is useful, why not use it? Only because it is not free?? Many of the younger generation hadn’t “connected” to Stallman’s militant and strict message, and this inter-generational gap led to a crisis within the movement in 1998 – a crisis that ultimately led to a division, and the birth of the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>.</span></p>
<h3>A Surreal Situation</h3>
<p><span>As we all know, Open Source is a much more familiar and household name than Free Software – and we’ll get to the reasons for this, and the actual differences between these two terms in a few minutes. The rise of Open Source <strong>created an odd situation</strong>, perhaps even a bit surreal.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Most people who have heard of me have been misinformed and believe that I’m a supporter of Open Source. I get messages several times a week thanking me for my contributions to Open Source, and I have to write back to them and point out that there is a misunderstanding here. I support the Free Software Movement.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>I should point out that Open is not a movement. The whole point was not to be a movement. You see, we are a movement: we’re fighting for something. Open Source was started by people that didn’t like the idea that there was an injustice to be fought and didn’t want to say that.”</span></em></p>
<h3>Tim O’Reilly</h3>
<p><span>At this point, it’s a good idea to introduce into the conversation one of the men who started Open Source.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Hey, Ran! [Ran: Hi, Tim, what’s up?] It’s good.”</span></em></p>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Tim_O%27Reilly-2009.jpg/193px-Tim_O%27Reilly-2009.jpg"></a><figcaption>Tim O’Reilly (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Although you might not recognize the voice, I’m willing to bet his name will ring a bell – at least for anyone who has been in the Hi-Tech industry for the last thirty years or so. He is <strong>Tim O’Reilly</strong>, founder of O’Reilly Media, which publishes a great many books on technological topics. He also one of the more<strong> influential thinkers</strong> in Silicon Valley, and popularized the terms Web 2.0 and – as we shall soon hear – Open Source itself. I asked Tim about his recollection of the pre-Free Software movement period.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“It’s actually interesting that you start there because there is a narrative that it all started with Richard Stallman and the GNU Manifesto. My first encounter with Free Software predates the GNU Manifesto. I was a tech writing consultant and I started using UNIX. I was really deep in the UNIX culture of free software. It was this big collaborative barn-raising that built UNIX. Even though it was originally developed at AT&amp;T, many of the key utilities were developed outside – particularly at UC Berkeley. I had become immersed in this culture and started documenting, filling in the gaps in the documentation for UNIX. I put together several documentation sets for clients. So, that was my world. It was the world of the shared community of UNIX.</span></em></p>
<h3>The UC Berkeley/Unix Culture</h3>
<p><em><span>“Richard [Stallman] came along and said – ‘Copyright is Evil, so we’ve got this new thing called Copyleft.’ Here at Berkeley we just said – ‘Take our software to Copy Central and make copies of it!’ [laughing] that was the culture that I grow up in, like – hey, we’re doing this thing for research, we’re doing this thing to advance the state of the art and we’re giving it away to all commerce because it’s just this reciprocal gift culture. It was really a continuation, in my mind, of that UC Berkeley/Early UNIX culture, that was really just about advancing the state of the art without having the political overlay that the Free Software Foundation had. But again, for me, I was really influenced by the UNIX/Berkeley side.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>And again, I also think you should realize that the UNIX/Berkeley side is also where most of the proto-internet software was created. The TCP/IP stack, BIND – the program that runs the DNS, Sendmail which did most of the early internet mail routing. They all came out of UC Berkeley and that was part of the world I was living in.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>So in essence, Tim is saying that Free Software – or at least the ideas of free software – didn’t start with the GNU project and that Open Source has much <strong>deeper roots</strong> in the sharing culture of UC Berkeley, back in the UNIX days.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I think Richard played a really important role in formulating a set of ideas, but in a lot of ways, I feel his work was a distraction from what was really happening. The narrative that said it began with the GNU Manifesto misses the fact that it was happening long before that, and if you look at the fruits of the tradition that was outside the scope of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Manifesto, they actually had a bigger impact. All those people who were sitting there, trying to make the Linux desktop win against Microsoft, was this huge distraction for the better part of a decade. And meanwhile, the future was marching on on the back of what came out of Berkeley/Unix. And again, I don’t want to give Berkeley too much credit because obviously a lot of internet software [didn’t originate there]. The TCP/IP stack that ended up getting most widely used came out of Berkeley, but not TCP/IP itself. BIND came out of Berkeley, but not the design for BIND. The DNS was actually designed somewhere else.”</span></em></p>
<h3>Incorrect Interpretation</h3>
<p><span>The popularity of the GNU/Linux operating system clearly demonstrated the positive technical potential of Free Software. Still, there were <strong>many engineers and businessmen that doubted its financial basis:</strong> how can a company survive if it’s giving away its product for free? One of the reasons some businesses refused to adopt Free Software stemmed from an incorrect interpretation of the term “Free” in this context. Some people mistook it to mean the software was distributed free of charge – and what costs nothing, goes the idiom, is worth nothing. Of course, that wasn’t what Richard Stallman meant – he spoke of free as in freedom, not gratis. But some businesspeople didn’t or couldn’t understand the ideological nuances behind the idea of Free Software.</span></p>
<h3><span>Open Source Is Born</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Opensource.svg/170px-Opensource.svg.png"></a><figcaption>Open Source Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In February 1998, a few developers and entrepreneurs met in California, in an organization called T<strong>he Foresight institute</strong>. The catalyst for the meeting was a dramatic announcement by the Netscape corporation that had taken place a month earlier. The name “<strong>Netscape</strong>” was familiar to almost anyone who used the web in the 1990s: it was the owner of the Netscape browser, the most popular browser at the time. Netscape’s leaders were familiar with the ideas behind the Free Software Foundation – and believed in them. In an almost unprecedented step, Netscape decided to share the browser’s source code and invited programmers around the world to contribute to it and improve it. Netscape’s announcement stirred a great interest in the technology world; The California conference participants of the Foresight institute wanted to take advantage of Netscape’s announcement and use the media attention to spread the ideas of Free Software. They decided it was their duty to educate the business world about the real advantages of free software: to emphasize the technical advantages of an open development model over a closed one. To do so – they had to detach themselves from Richard Stallman and his ideological burden.</span></p>
<p><span>This wasn’t an easy decision; Richard Stallman was a living legend, a figure larger than life. He was the face and the heart of the Free Software Foundation, devoting his life to the Free Software movement and to the ideals they all believed in. But the conference participants felt that the philosophical discussion about freedom, control, and class struggle was hurting their cause. They wanted to focus on the practical benefits of Free Software, such as the increase in innovation – but they all knew Stallman, and all knew he <strong>would never agree</strong> to that approach. So they finally decided to quit Stallman’s Free Software Foundation, and establish a new one called “Open Source Initiative.” The name “open source” was chosen specifically in order to avoid connotations related to “free.”</span></p>
<h3>The Open Source Summit</h3>
<p><span>This is where Tim O’Reilly entered the scene. In 1998 he organized a conference of some of the <strong>best and brightest minds</strong> in the software world: Linus Torvalds, Guido Van Rossum (the creator of Python), Larry Wall (of Perl) and many other luminaries.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I’ve been thinking about it all through the Fall that I wanted to bring all these people together. I realized that I knew all these people – they didn’t know each other. I would go to the IETF meetings – the Internet Engineering Task Force – and see Paul Vixie there (the guy who wrote BIND) or Eric Allman who wrote Sendmail, but none of the GNU people – they didn’t even know about the IETF as far as I could tell. I was kind of thinking – I want to bridge these two communities, the internet community, and the Linux community.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>This conference is known today as the<strong> Open Source Summit</strong>, but it wasn’t called that in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“And so I scheduled this event, what I called at the time ‘The Freeware Summit’. In the meantime, what I believe was six weeks before, Christine Peterson of the Foresight Institute which was really a nanotechnology think tank, proposed the term Open Source. I didn’t know about that when I invited people. “</span></em></p>
<h3>Getting the Media Onboard</h3>
<p><em><span>“I built a lot of relations with the press then, and I also got this idea that telling a big story was the right way to advance the agenda. So in addition to bringing all these people together for this Freeware Summit, my goal right from the outset was: we’re going to tell a story about all these people who have this thing in common.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>But it was not actually until during the day at that meeting that I heard the term Open Source. We were talking about the naming issues, and Eric told about the invention of this term, Open Source, and actually there was quite a bit of push back! It sounds like ‘open sores’, it will never fly…but I said – look, we really want to have a common story, so let’s take a vote and let’s all agree that this is the term. So, everybody who was there, we took a vote and Open Source won. So we had a press conference at the end of the day and we introduced the term.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>The way the press conference was set up was, I just had all these people behind a long table, and we had people from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, San Jose Mercury which at the time was the paper record of Silicon Valley, Forbes, and Fortune. And I said, look – all these guys have an absolute market share in the category of software with no marketing budget, no company behind them, just on the strength of their ideas of this new development model and this model of giving away the software for free over the internet. It’s called Open Source.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>I said look – you guys have been told that the Free Software is that rebel movement that’s hostile to commercial software. I’m here to tell a very different story, and that is that you are all already using Free Software, you just don’t know it. I went down a list: if you have a domain name, nytime.com or fortune.com, you’re using a software written by this long haired guy over here, and the entire internet depends on that piece of free software. Oh, and if you send email, Eric Allman here wrote the program Sendmail that routes 75% of all the internet’s email. 75% of all websites are actually running on Apache, which was started by this long haired guy here, and co-founded by this long haired guy here.”</span></em></p>
<h3>A Great Success</h3>
<p><span>Tim’s initiative was a great success. The fact that so many opinion leaders and experts sponsored the Open Source initiative helped <strong>push it forward</strong>, and within a few years it eclipsed its big sister, Free Software.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I had no role in the coining of the term ‘Open Source’. I think what I did that was really meaningful and turned out to be profoundly right, is that I said – you know, I don’t think this licensing frame really matters. And in fact, that is why I kinda got demonized by the Free Software Foundation, because I was saying they didn’t matter.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>It’s hard to imagine our current technology world without GNU/Linux, WordPress, Android, PHP and many other software projects that are distributed with their source code. There are <strong>thousands of communities</strong>, large and small, devoted to software tools of almost every sort imaginable: from word processing to espionage software. Some projects last for many years – Linux is a great example – and some are a result of a weekend hackathons, fueled by pizza and soda.</span></p>

<h3><span>What Draws Companies to Open Source?</span></h3>
<figure><a href="http://yougottalovefrontend.com/images/organizers/Yonti.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jonathan Israel of Wix</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>At this point I think we should take a slight digression, you might say, and ask ourselves what draws big tech companies to open source their software – that is, to give it away for free? To help with this question I sat down recently with <strong>Jonathan Israel</strong> of <strong>Wix.com</strong> – a company that specializes in providing easy to use web building tools.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“My name is Jonathan Israel, I work for the Wix Academy for about a year: it is the department which is primarily in charge of recruiting and training junior engineers for the Wix R&amp;D. We’ve also expanded into establishing and maintaining the dev-centric culture that we have at Wix R&amp;D.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Wix, says Jonathan, not only allows its developers to release code they worked on as Open Source – it wants them to do so:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“We promote open source projects, we organize conferences, we allow the people time to write blog posts and help them with resources such as tech writers. We’re pushing forward a lot of standards in open source project, as in your code needs to be documented, it needs to be clear, and we allow engineers that actually develop tools to help with their day-to-day work – to open source them, to allow the people to use the same tools, to learn from the mistakes that we had as a really big development group.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>R: Which brings me to an interesting question. I can understand why you, as developers, have an incentive to release what you worked on as open source. But what incentive does Wix as a company have for open sourcing code which its own developers worked hard for?</span></em></p>
<h3>Knowledge and Branding</h3>
<p><em><span>J: There are two main reasons for that. The first one I already said and will say again. […] it’s the idea that they are first and foremost part of the engineering community. And so, they have a lot of incentive to open source what they are doing and we don’t think that’s a bad idea. On the contrary – you show people that the engineers who work here are engineers like any other place, and we don’t mind. It’s a good idea to show that we support the idea of open source, we support the idea of blog posting, we support the idea [of] sharing the knowledge.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Secondly, and this is a problem that a lot of huge companies used to face, is the problem that looking at Wix.com, which is a platform that allows you build a website without touching a piece of code, ever, it kinda looks trivial. That’s the brand as well: the idea is – ‘anyone can do it’. By going to Wix.com you would realize that this is mostly a software company. Roughly 40% of the company are R&amp;D, and that’s a huge chunk [of the company], there’s no other department that is as big. By encouraging and helping our developers to show their work – if it’s open source project, blog posts, going on stage in conferences and a million other things – that helps Wix show that the engineers who work here are top notch. They are looking at the cutting edge technologies that we can use, they are very experienced. It’s not your boring, ordinary, software engineering. It’s the main thing that we do. “</span></em></p>
<p><span>In other words, companies like Wix view the idea of sharing software not as a liability – but as an opportunity. By releasing software as Open Source, they encourage their developers to learn new things, be part of a greater community and feel more satisfied. In the process, these companies also brand themselves as leaders and positive forces of innovation in the world of technology. It’s a win-win situation that helped the open source community explode over the last few years.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why is Google Killing Android</span></h3>
<p><span>I admit that it was hard for me at first to understand why Stallman denies the Open Source Initiative – an initiative that exists mainly due to his early efforts. But looking closely at Stallman’s motives, I could begin to grasp the <strong>roots of his resentment</strong>. It is easy to let Stallman off the hook by saying that he is a rigid conservative ideologist who wouldn’t put his pride aside and admit that someone else marketed his ideas better than him. But is that really the case here? I am not so sure. Here is an example that might make you think twice about the way our modern technology world operates. It has to do with the Android operating system. As I said, it will make you think TWICE, since in fact there are two Android operating systems.</span></p>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Android_robot_2014.svg/204px-Android_robot_2014.svg.png"></a><figcaption>Android Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In the late 2000’s, Apple set the tone in the smartphones’ market. When you said “smartphone”, you meant Apple’s iPhone. <strong>Google saw Apple’s success as a threat</strong> and wanted to gain at least some of the smartphone market share in order to sustain its control of search and other online services. Therefore, in 2006, Google initiated the <strong>Android Open Source Project, or ASOP</strong> for short – an operating system for smartphones developed by “Android Ltd,” which was bought by Google. A resourceful community grew around Android, with many developers who created new apps and modifications for the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>A quick jump to the present. <strong>The tables have turned:</strong> Android has the lion’s share of the smartphone market and is making Google a lot of money. However, its Open Source status has now become a disadvantage for Google. Since Android’s code is available to the public, nothing prevents a competitor from taking the code, modifying it a bit and then using it in its own smartphones or tablets. In fact, that is exactly was Amazon did! Amazon took Android, adapted it to its own tablets and created a competitive app store to Google’s Play Store.</span></p>
<h3>App Rot</h3>
<p><span>You don’t have to have a degree in business management in order to see that Google has <strong>no interest in providing other companies a with a “gift”</strong> like a ready-to-use operating system. But on the other hand, it’s also not in Google’s best interest to upset its developers’ community, the people who worked hard on Android all these years – so turning Android into a proprietary software was also out of the question. Google’s solution, then, was to slowly but surely “strangle” the Android Open Source Project.</span></p>
<p><span>How? When users turn on their Android device for the first time, they find all sorts of basic and standard apps already installed on their smartphone: a Calendar, keyboard, camera, music player, and more. These apps are a part of the Android Open Source Project, and every phone maker who wants to use Android gets them for free as a part of the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>At the beginning, Google updated these apps on a regular basis – but over the last few years, Google stopped updating the open source apps. Instead, it released new, proprietary apps, substitutes for the old ones. The SMS application, for example, was replaced by Hangouts. The music app was replaced by Google Play Music, and the same goes for the calendar app, the camera app, the search app, the keyboard and more. The new apps are being updated frequently while <strong>the old ones slowly rot away, neglected</strong>. For example, the proprietary version of the search app has a voice recognition ability, and can read search results out loud. The open source version for the same app supports text search and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span>Now let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a cell phone manufacturer, Samsung for example. Android is an open source software, so Samsung could use it “as is” – it doesn’t need Google’s permission. But what Samsung will get is an inferior operating system with some aging apps. If it wishes to have the newer, proprietary apps – it needs to strike a deal with Google and pay whatever needs to be paid. The final outcome is that Samsung and almost all other smartphone makers are <strong>tied to Google in “golden chains”</strong> and cannot compete with it. And if there is no competition – the customer is almost always on the losing side.</span></p>
<h3>Bussiness and Ethics</h3>
<p><span>Honestly, I don’t blame Google. If I were in Sergey’s Brin shoes – I’d probably make the same business decisions, and that’s <strong>exactly what Stallman is saying.</strong> In his view, companies like Google adopt the Open Source policy for the financial benefit it offers. But as soon as that benefit disappears, they happily abandoned it. Had Google, for example, adopted the Free Software ideology of maintaining the user’s’ freedom, encouraging innovation, and so on – it might not have backed down from it so easily.</span></p>
<p><span>Tim O’Reilly, however, <strong>completely disagrees</strong> with this assumption.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I think they are completely orthogonal. The morality of a company is not encoded by a license that compels them to morality. If we are compelled to morality – it’s actually a much shallower morality than one that seems us all as members of the same species, all members of the same body. If you think that way, you will act morally.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>“I think Open Source is the way of life, just like gravity is the way of life. There are certain dynamics that actually work, and the quest of Open Source should figure out what works in terms of creating the most value for society, for individuals or companies. I always saw Open Source as a scientific pursuit and felt the Free Software Foundation treated it almost as if it’s a religious pursuit. It was certainly a moral pursuit. And the thing that always bothered me are the critics who always said – well, Open Source doesn’t have a moral backing. That’s like the political conservatives saying that the liberals don’t have a moral backing. You’ve got to be kidding! These are just different moral backing. One is the stern, punishing father moral backing, and the other is the nurturing mother. The idealism of a Tim Berners-Lee or Larry Wall, who gave their software free to the world: are you telling me that that is not a moral act? And that it’s more moral to say “we’re gonna put out this software with a bunch of restrictions to make sure that nobody does something that we don’t approve of. I’m just on the more liberal side.”</span></em></p>
<h3><span>A Dark Prophecy</span></h3>
<p><span>Richard Stallman still leads the Free Software Foundation as its president and continues to <strong>warn against the dangers</strong> of proprietary technology.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I’m afraid that we would someday need free hardware designs and then to fabricate them to have computers that permit us to run free software. Look at the “iThings”, those monsters from Apple. They are designed to make it hard to install any different software. Apple is trying to have total control on what software people can run. In fact, the only way people can install software that Apple didn’t approve is to ‘Jailbreak’ the machine. Think about that term – jailbreak. These people, these users of iThings are saying that the iThing is a jail for its user, and they are exactly right. And Window’s phones and tablets do the same thing. This practice is spreading. I hope it won’t be true, but it may be true in some years that only free hardware designs will make it possible for us to use free software.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>This is <strong>a dark prophecy</strong>. I didn’t want our interview to end on such a negative tone, so I asked Stallman which gadgets he uses. You know… as one geek to another… after all, Stallman is a hacker, THE hacker. Well… I wasn’t ready for this one:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“[Ran: I guess that you like Technology, right? I mean, on a personal level…]</span></em></p>
<h3>Making the Right Choice</h3>
<p><span>I must admit that Stallman made me think. I have always been a sworn fan of any kind of technology and was the first to buy every new gadget and cool app. I never gave a second thought about my freedom of choice, the right of innovation, or other issues Stallman cares about so dearly. <strong>I’ll probably be more aware</strong> of these matters in the future, and they may affect my purchasing decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>But how far will I go with my inner truth? Richard Stallman, as he was during the 1970s and 80s, was an inspiration. A mythological hacker. A man who breathed ate and slept technology twenty-four-seven. But Richard Stallman of 2016 doesn’t own a smartphone or tablet and doesn’t listen to MP3 music files. Stallman seems to be afraid of technology. For me, it’s like hearing <strong>Superman</strong> confess that he’s afraid of heights.</span></p>
<p><span>This may sound like an impossible choice to make: should I give up my love for technology, or should I give up my freedom? I fear that if Stallman is right, a day might come when I will actually have to choose. I fear the day when I will find out that I am <strong>not brave enough</strong> to make the right choice.</span></p>

Despite dramatic, recent increases in accuracy, three challenges remain: (i) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for which an MSA cannot be generated, (ii) rapid exploration of designed structures, and (iii) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent geometric network (RGN) able to predict protein structure from single protein sequences without use of MSAs. This deep learning system has two novel elements: a protein language model (AminoBERT) that uses a Transformer to learn latent structural information from millions of unaligned proteins and a geometric module that compactly represents C<sub>α</sub> backbone geometry. RGN2 outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (as well as trRosetta) on orphan proteins and is competitive with designed sequences, while achieving up to a 10<sup>6</sup>-fold reduction in compute time. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical strengths of protein language models relative to MSAs in structure prediction.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-4">M.A. is a member of the SAB of FL2021-002, a Foresite Labs company, and consults for Interline Therapeutics.

<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_1.png"></a></p><div><p>Ulam spiral of size 200×200. Black dots represent prime numbers. Diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines with a high density of prime numbers are clearly visible.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Randomly_black_odd_numbers.png"></a></p><div><p>For comparison, a spiral with random odd numbers colored black (at the same density of primes in a 200x200 spiral).</p></div></div></div>
<p>The <b>Ulam spiral</b> or <b>prime spiral</b> is a graphical depiction of the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" title="Prime number">prime numbers</a>, devised by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Ulam" title="Stanisław Ulam">Stanisław Ulam</a> in 1963 and popularized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner" title="Martin Gardner">Martin Gardner&#39;s</a> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics" title="Recreational mathematics">Mathematical Games</a></i> column in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i> a short time later.  It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.
</p><p>Ulam and Gardner emphasized the striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes. Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function" title="Quadratic function">quadratic polynomials</a>, and certain such polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler" title="Euler">Euler</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Prime_formulas_and_polynomial_functions" title="Formula for primes">prime-generating polynomial</a> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers.  Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with major unsolved problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%27s_problems" title="Landau&#39;s problems">Landau&#39;s problems</a>.  In particular, no quadratic polynomial has ever been proved to generate infinitely many primes, much less to have a high asymptotic density of them, although there is a well-supported <a href="#Hardy_and_Littlewood&#39;s_Conjecture_F">conjecture</a> as to what that asymptotic density should be.
</p><p>In 1932, more than thirty years prior to Ulam&#39;s discovery, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetologist" title="Herpetologist">herpetologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Monroe_Klauber" title="Laurence Monroe Klauber">Laurence Klauber</a> constructed a triangular, non-spiral array containing vertical and diagonal lines exhibiting a similar concentration of prime numbers.  Like Ulam, Klauber noted the connection with prime-generating polynomials, such as Euler&#39;s.

<p>The Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral" title="Spiral">spiral</a> arrangement on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_lattice" title="Square lattice">square lattice</a>:
</p>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_spiral_howto_all_numbers.svg" title="Numbers from 1 to 49 placed in spiral order"></a></p></div>
<p>and then marking the prime numbers:
</p>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_spiral_howto_primes_only.svg" title="Small Ulam spiral"></a></p></div>
<p>In the figure, primes appear to concentrate along certain diagonal lines.  In the 200×200 Ulam spiral shown above, diagonal lines are clearly visible, confirming that the pattern continues. Horizontal and vertical lines with a high density of primes, while less prominent, are also evident.  Most often, the number spiral is started with the number 1 at the center, but it is possible to start with any number, and the same concentration of primes along diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines is observed. Starting with 41 at the center gives a diagonal containing an unbroken string of 40 primes (starting from 1523 southwest of the origin, decreasing to 41 at the origin, and increasing to 1601 northeast of the origin), the longest example of its kind.
</p>
<h2><span id="History">History</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ulam_spiral&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: History">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>According to Gardner, Ulam discovered the spiral in 1963 while doodling during the presentation of &#34;a long and very boring paper&#34; at a scientific meeting.  These hand calculations amounted to &#34;a few hundred points&#34;.  Shortly afterwards, Ulam, with collaborators Myron Stein and Mark Wells, used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_II" title="MANIAC II">MANIAC II</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory</a> to extend the calculation to about 100,000 points.  The group also computed the density of primes among numbers up to 10,000,000 along some of the prime-rich lines as well as along some of the prime-poor lines.  Images of the spiral up to 65,000 points were displayed on &#34;a scope attached to the machine&#34; and then photographed.  The Ulam spiral was described in Martin Gardner&#39;s March 1964 <i>Mathematical Games</i> column in <i>Scientific American</i>  and featured on the front cover of that issue.  Some of the photographs of Stein, Ulam, and Wells were reproduced in the column.
</p><p>In an addendum to the <i>Scientific American</i> column, Gardner mentioned the earlier paper of Klauber.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
Klauber describes his construction as follows, &#34;The integers are arranged in triangular order with 1 at the apex, the second line containing numbers 2 to 4, the third 5 to 9, and so forth.  When the primes have been indicated, it is found that there are concentrations in certain vertical and diagonal lines, and amongst these the so-called Euler sequences with high concentrations of primes are discovered.&#34;

<h2><span id="Explanation">Explanation</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ulam_spiral&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Explanation">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>Diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines in the number spiral correspond to polynomials of the form
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are integer constants.  When <i>b</i> is even, the lines are diagonal, and either all numbers are odd, or all are even, depending on the value of <i>c</i>.  It is therefore no surprise that all primes other than 2 lie in alternate diagonals of the Ulam spiral.  Some  polynomials, such as <span></span>, while producing only odd values, factorize over the integers <span></span> and are therefore never prime except possibly when one of the factors equals 1. Such examples correspond to diagonals that are devoid of primes or nearly so.
</p><p>To gain insight into why some of the remaining odd diagonals may have a higher concentration of primes than others, consider <span></span> and <span></span>. Compute remainders upon division by 3 as <i>n</i> takes successive values 0, 1, 2, ....  For the first of these polynomials, the sequence of remainders is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ..., while for the second, it is 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, .... This implies that in the sequence of values taken by the second polynomial, two out of every three are divisible by 3, and hence certainly not prime, while in the sequence of values taken by the first polynomial, none are divisible by 3. Thus it seems plausible that the first polynomial will produce values with a higher density of primes than will the second. At the very least, this observation gives little reason to believe that the corresponding diagonals will be equally dense with primes. One should, of course, consider divisibility by primes other than 3. Examining divisibility by 5 as well, remainders upon division by 15 repeat with pattern 1, 11, 14, 10, 14, 11, 1, 14, 5, 4, 11, 11, 4, 5, 14 for the first polynomial, and with pattern 5, 0, 3, 14, 3, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 9, 3 for the second, implying that only three out of 15 values in the second sequence are potentially prime (being divisible by neither 3 nor 5), while 12 out of 15 values in the first sequence are potentially prime (since only three are divisible by 5 and none are divisible by 3).
</p><p>While rigorously-proved results about primes in quadratic sequences are scarce, considerations like those above give rise to a plausible conjecture on the asymptotic density of primes in such sequences, which is described in the next section.

<p>In their 1923 paper on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture" title="Goldbach&#39;s conjecture">Goldbach Conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">Hardy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood" title="John Edensor Littlewood">Littlewood</a> stated a series of conjectures, one of which, if true, would explain some of the striking features of the Ulam spiral. This conjecture, which Hardy and Littlewood called &#34;Conjecture F&#34;, is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture" title="Bateman–Horn conjecture">Bateman–Horn conjecture</a> and asserts an asymptotic formula for the number of primes of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>. Rays emanating from the central region of the Ulam spiral making angles of 45° with the horizontal and vertical correspond to numbers of the form 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> with <i>b</i> even; horizontal and vertical rays correspond to numbers of the same form with <i>b</i> odd. Conjecture F provides a formula that can be used to estimate the density of primes along such rays. It implies that there will be considerable variability in the density along different rays. In particular, the density is highly sensitive to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant" title="Discriminant">discriminant</a> of the polynomial, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> − 16<i>c</i>.
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_2.png"></a></p><div><p>The primes of the form 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 2<i>x</i> + 41 with <i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, ... have been highlighted in purple. The prominent parallel line in the lower half of the figure corresponds to 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>x</i> + 41 or, equivalently, to negative values of <i>x</i>.</p></div></div></div>
<p>Conjecture F is concerned with polynomials of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are integers and <i>a</i> is positive. If the coefficients contain a common factor greater than 1 or if the discriminant Δ = <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> − 4<i>ac</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" title="Square number">perfect square</a>, the polynomial factorizes and therefore produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_numbers" title="Composite numbers">composite numbers</a> as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... (except possibly for one or two values of <i>x</i> where one of the factors equals 1). Moreover, if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are both even, the polynomial produces only even values, and is therefore composite except possibly for the value 2. Hardy and Littlewood assert that, apart from these situations, <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> takes prime values infinitely often as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This statement is a special case of an earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture" title="Bunyakovsky conjecture">conjecture of Bunyakovsky</a> and remains open. Hardy and Littlewood further assert that, asymptotically, the number <i>P</i>(<i>n</i>) of primes of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> and less than <i>n</i> is given by
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>A</i> depends on <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> but not on <i>n</i>. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" title="Prime number theorem">prime number theorem</a>, this formula with <i>A</i> set equal to one is the asymptotic number of primes less than <i>n</i> expected in a random set of numbers having the same density as the set of numbers of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>. But since <i>A</i> can take values bigger or smaller than 1, some polynomials, according to the conjecture, will be especially rich in primes, and others especially poor. An unusually rich polynomial is 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 2<i>x</i> + 41 which forms a visible line in the Ulam spiral. The constant <i>A</i> for this polynomial is approximately 6.6, meaning that the numbers it generates are almost seven times as likely to be prime as random numbers of comparable size, according to the conjecture. This particular polynomial is related to Euler&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Prime_formulas_and_polynomial_functions" title="Formula for primes">prime-generating polynomial</a> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41 by replacing <i>x</i> with 2<i>x</i>, or equivalently, by restricting <i>x</i> to the even numbers. The constant <i>A</i> is given by a product running over all prime numbers,
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span>,</dd></dl>
<p>in which <span></span> is number of zeros of the quadratic polynomial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" title="Modular arithmetic">modulo</a> <i>p</i> and therefore takes one of the values 0, 1, or 2.  Hardy and Littlewood break the product into three factors as

<dl><dd><span></span>.</dd></dl>
<p>Here the factor ε, corresponding to the prime 2, is 1 if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is odd and 2 if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is even. The first product index <i>p</i> runs over the finitely-many odd primes dividing both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.  For these primes <span></span> since  <i>p</i> then cannot divide <i>c</i>. The second product index <span></span> runs over the infinitely-many odd primes not dividing <i>a</i>. For these primes <span></span> equals 1, 2, or 0 depending on whether the discriminant is 0, a non-zero square, or a non-square modulo <i>p</i>. This is accounted for by the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol" title="Legendre symbol">Legendre symbol</a>, <span></span>.  When a prime <i>p</i> divides <i>a</i> but not <i>b</i> there is one root modulo <i>p</i>.  Consequently, such primes do not contribute to the product.

<p>Klauber&#39;s 1932 paper describes a triangle in which row <i>n</i> contains the numbers (<i>n</i>  −  1)<sup>2</sup> + 1 through <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>. As in the Ulam spiral, quadratic polynomials generate numbers that lie in straight lines. Vertical lines correspond to numbers of the form <i>k</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>k</i> + <i>M</i>. Vertical and diagonal lines with a high density of prime numbers are evident in the figure.
</p><p>Robert Sacks devised a variant of the Ulam spiral in 1994. In the Sacks spiral, the non-negative integers are plotted on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral" title="Archimedean spiral">Archimedean spiral</a> rather than the square spiral used by Ulam, and are spaced so that one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" title="Square number">perfect square</a> occurs in each full rotation. (In the Ulam spiral, two squares occur in each rotation.) Euler&#39;s prime-generating polynomial, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41, now appears as a single curve as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This curve asymptotically approaches a horizontal line in the left half of the figure. (In the Ulam spiral, Euler&#39;s polynomial forms two diagonal lines, one in the top half of the figure, corresponding to even values of <i>x</i> in the sequence, the other in the bottom half of the figure corresponding to odd values of <i>x</i> in the sequence.)
</p><p>Additional structure may be seen when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number" title="Composite number">composite numbers</a> are also included in the Ulam spiral. The number 1 has only a single factor, itself; each prime number has two factors, itself and 1; composite numbers are divisible by at least three different factors. Using the size of the dot representing an integer to indicate the number of factors and coloring prime numbers red and composite numbers blue produces the figure shown.
</p><p>Spirals following other tilings of the plane also generate lines rich in prime numbers, for example hexagonal spirals.

    <h2>Surveys show Americans want more walkable cities and bike riding continues to grow. Yet urban streets are still designed and used like highways. Change is happening, but at a very slow pace, says urban expert Jeff Speck.</h2>

      <title>Apple’s new abuse prevention system: an antritust/competition point of view</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___blog_quintarelli_it_2021_08_apples-child-new-abuse-prevention-system-an-antritustcompetition-point-of-view_html/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div itemprop="articleBody">

			
				
				<p>Apple has announced the new client-side content scanning (based on parameters received from the center) to find child sexual abuse materials to be reported to law enforcers.</p>
<p>As per Apple’s announcement, that will happen when uploading those content to iCloud (Apple’s cloud) and it will be opt-in when usage is limited to the device (i.e. not when uploading to iCloud, but for example when sending a message with those contents).</p>
<p>I want to stress that this is <span>Apple’s current announcement</span>. Is it going to be forever so ? Quite unlikely: if the purpose is to analyze content stored on iCloud, given it’s not encrypted, it would be much easier to analyze it once it’s uploaded to the servers, as it is the case with Dropbox, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>The fact that, for non-cloud content, the feature is opt-in, implies that</p>
<ul>
<li>criminals will not opt-in (and not use cloud services) and</li>
<li>not criminals are not exposed to such content anyway (have you received such material recently ??).</li>
</ul>
<p>Children’s safety groups praised Apple’s moves, arguing that they strike a necessary balance which “brings us a step closer to justice for survivors whose most traumatic moments are disseminated online”.</p>
<p>As abominable as these materials can be, do we  really believe that opt-in client-side scanning will do something to eradicate those behaviors ? Do we thing criminals will opt in ? Do we really believe that client side scanning of content uploaded to iCloud will eradicate them ? Do we think criminals use iCloud for their trades ?</p>
<p>I want to stress again that this is the <span>current</span> announced feature. It is easily forseeable that over time pressure by law enforcers will increase to move <span>past the opt-in regime and thus not only for iCloud</span>. What else would be the point of having client side scanning just for iCloud if you could do it centrally as all other providers do ? Quite obviously, client side scanning is for client side scanning. And once there’s that feature, requests to use it will increase.</p>
<p><span>Having started  right away with general client side scanning would  likely not have been  acceptable by the user and by legal communities. But starting just for iCloud, just for the most abominable of all possible crimes, makes client side scanning more acceptable</span>. And those who oppose it appear to be conniving with criminals. This is the same argument we have heard time and again for the compression of privacy rights in favor of a supposed increase of security. But this equation (less privacy = more security) is only apparently founded. Less privacy equals more data, more data does not equal more information and more information does not equal more security. (remember intel agencies knew the menace of 9.11 attacks ? And many others… (almost all, in Europe)).</p>
<p>Do we really think criminals trade CSAM in plain-sight web sites ? Or via ordinary messages ? Or store them on public cloud servers run by major corporations ?…</p>
<p>But the idea is very attractive to law enforcers, tomorrow’s possibility to dig into users’ content without having to complicate their lives installing trojans. It’s the dream of a backdoor available to law enforcement. But when a backdoor is installed, the backdoor exists and history teaches that it’s only a matter of time before it’s also used by the bad guys and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The above issues have also been raised by other important commentators and better than I have done. But there’s one more angle I want to add: <span><strong>Why is Apple doing it</strong></span>, given their previous stances on privacy safeguards, <span><strong>and why are they doing it now ?</strong></span>.</p>
<p>First of all, please do this (really) easy exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>right click on the cat below and save the file to your computer.</li>
<li>then go to <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide">this link </a>, hit ‘browse’ and select the file you just saved; move the “hidden bits” gauge to 3 and see the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ain’t magic, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">very simple, five centuries old mathematics</a>. You could even encrypt it with a password to obtain the payload and it may be impossible to tell, if you don’t know the little secret.</p>
<p>Do we really  think criminals don’t know mathematics or programming ?</p>
<p><strong>Client side scanning can do little to stop criminals, unless you have a full control of what apps users can install on their devices</strong>. (and how they can use them).</p>
<p>But this is precisely the case of some antitrust actions that are now being brought forward against Apple on the basis that they purportedly excise a monopolistic power on the platform, by their tight control of the App Store where they are the gatekeepers who decide which apps can or can’t be installed by users on their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Apple could have introduced client-side scanning anytime in the past, but now, thanks to this move, Apple will be able to tell the supreme court and the FTC narratives like…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have just released this beautiful tool, that will help law enforcers combat these abominable crimes, but only if they can tightly control apps installed by users</li>
<li>If you’re siding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_neutrality">device neutrality</a> you’re siding with the criminals</li>
<li>Fewer competition is a price  worth paying to protect children</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, in order to have an effective (?) law enforcement, the only possibility is that hardware and software manufacturing companies exercise a total control on the software users can use, de facto becoming states’ digital-law-enforcement  agencies.</p>
<p>If this isn’t a total dystopia, I don’t know what dystopia is…</p>

  <p>Archaeologists in northwestern Saudi Arabia have unearthed a massive collection of bones likely stockpiled by <a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/striped-hyena">striped hyenas</a> over the past 7,000 years.</p>




  

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    
  

  <p>Found in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238113869_UMM_JIRSAN_ARABIA&#39;S_LONGEST_LAVA-TUBE_SYSTEM">Umm Jirsan</a> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/nature/lava-tubes.htm">lava tube</a> system—a sprawling network of tunnels formed by volcanic activity—the <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417892665937612805">hundreds of thousands</a> of bones belong to at least 14 kinds of animals, including cattle, caprids, horses, camels, rodents and even humans. The researchers’ findings are newly published in the journal <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-021-01365-6">Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences</a></em><em>.</em></p>




  

  <p>Lead author <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/109668/25522">Mathew Stewart</a>, a zooarchaeologist at the <a href="https://www.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History</a> in Germany, tells <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/hyenas-left-a-massive-pile-of-bones-in-a-saudi-arabian-1847370667">Gizmodo</a></em>’s Isaac Schultz that the team identified hyenas as the culprits after analyzing cuts, bites and digestion marks found on the bones.</p>




  

  <p>“Striped hyena are very avid accumulators of bones,” Stewart says.</p>




  

  <p>Researchers have been investigating the site, which is located in the country’s <a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=231060">Harrat Khaybar lava field</a>, since 2007. But they only ventured into the cavern’s depths a few months ago. (Per <em>Gizmodo</em>, another group of archaeologists reported hearing possible hyena <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238113869_UMM_JIRSAN_ARABIA&#39;S_LONGEST_LAVA-TUBE_SYSTEM">snarls</a> in the tubes, prompting them to keep their distance.)</p>

  <p>For the study, the team analyzed 1,917 bones and teeth recovered from the lava tube. <a href="https://www.radiocarbon.com/about-carbon-dating.htm">Radiocarbon dating</a> of a small number of these samples found that they ranged in age from around 439 to 6,839 years old, suggesting “a long use of the lava tube system by carnivores,” per the paper.</p>




  

  <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417894029195350020">Twitter thread</a> quoted by<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2021/08/01/Scientists-discover-hundreds-of-thousands-of-animal-human-bones-in-Saudi-Arabia-cave"> <em>Al Arabiya English</em></a>’s Joanne Serrieh, Stewart notes that hyenas transport bones “to dens to be consumed, fed to young or cached.” The study adds that the carnivores engage in both hunting and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/">scavenging</a> activities, killing some animals while simply hoarding the remains of others.</p>




  

  <p>A key sign that hyenas were responsible for the huge pile of bones was the presence of human skull fragments. The mammals are notorious for rummaging through graves for grub.</p>




  

  <p>“It’s always just the skullcap that survives,” Stewart tells <em>Gizmodo</em>. “[Hyenas] seem to not really be interested in skull caps. We found maybe five or six skullcaps with gnaw marks on them at the site, but only the skullcaps. Nothing else.”</p>




  

  <p>Lone hyenas <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/">typically snack</a> on dead animals. But packs prefer to hunt, targeting prey like antelopes, hares, rodents and birds.</p>



  

  <center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy to introduce the Umm Jirsan lava tube, Saudi Arabia, in our new paper just out in AAS. </p>— Stewie Stewart (@StewieStewart13) <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417892665937612805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></blockquote> </center>



  

  <p>Umm Jirsan is far from the only example of hyenas stockpiling huge assemblages of bones. As Riley Black wrote for <em><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-horse-hunting-hyenas-of-srbsko-chlum-komin-cave">National Geographic</a> </em>in 2010, the Srbsko Chlum-Komin Cave in the Czech Republic contains more than 3,500 well-preserved large mammal bones collected by the carnivores.</p>




  

  <p>The new study took place as part of the <a href="https://www.palaeodeserts.com/" target="_blank">Palaeodeserts Project</a>, which seeks to track human and animal migration across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia’s harsh weather makes this task difficult: Hot conditions can make bones break down, and some ancient remains actually disintegrate when touched.</p>




  

  <p>“The most surprising thing comes down to just how well preserved the material is, and how much material there is, given that in Saudi we have no faunal remains, really,” Stewart tells <em>Gizmodo</em>.</p>




  

  <p>In the Twitter thread, Stewart lauds the lava tube’s “excellent conditions for preservation of bone.”</p>




  

  <p>He adds, “Umm Jirsan (and other similar sites in the region) is likely to hold valuable insights into the ecologies and environments of Holocene Arabia. This study is just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

      <title>Apply conversion functions to data in SQLite columns with the SQLite-utils tool</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___simonwillison_net_2021_Aug_6_sqlite-utils-convert_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="primary">

<div>




<p>Earlier this week I released <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-14">sqlite-utils 3.14</a> with a powerful new command-line tool: <code>sqlite-utils convert</code>, which applies a conversion function to data stored in a SQLite column.</p>
<p>Anyone who works with data will tell you that 90% of the work is cleaning it up. Running command-line conversions against data in a SQLite file turns out to be a really productive way to do that.</p>
<h4>Transforming a column</h4>
<p>Here’s a simple example. Say someone gave you data with numbers that are formatted with commas—like <code>3,044,502</code>—in a <code>count</code> column in a <code>states</code> table.</p>
<p>You can strip those commas out like so:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert states.db states count \
    &#39;value.replace(&#34;,&#34;, &#34;&#34;)&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>convert</code> command takes four arguments: the database file, the name of the table, the name of the column and a string containing a fragment of Python code that defines the conversion to be applied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The conversion function can be anything you can express with Python. If you want to import extra modules you can do so using <code>--import module</code>—here’s an example that wraps text using the <a href="">textwrap</a> module from the Python standard library:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert content.db articles content \
    &#39;&#34;\n&#34;.join(textwrap.wrap(value, 100))&#39; \
    --import=textwrap
</code></pre>
<p>You can consider this analogous to using <code>Array.map()</code> in JavaScript, or applying a transformation in a Python list comprehension in Python.</p>
<h4>Custom functions in SQLite</h4>
<p>Under the hood, the tool takes advantage of a powerful SQLite feature: the ability to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.create_function">register custom functions</a> written in Python (or other languages) and call them from SQL.</p>
<p>The text wrapping example above works by executing the following SQL:</p>
<div><pre><span>update</span> articles <span>set</span> content <span>=</span> convert_value(content)</pre></div>
<p><code>convert_value(value)</code> is a custom SQL function, compiled as Python code and then made available to the database connection.</p>
<p>The equivalent code using just the Python standard library would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>sqlite3</span>
<span>import</span> <span>textwrap</span>

<span>def</span> <span>convert_value</span>(<span>value</span>):
    <span>return</span> <span>&#34;<span>\n</span>&#34;</span>.<span>join</span>(<span>textwrap</span>.<span>wrap</span>(<span>value</span>, <span>100</span>))

<span>conn</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlite3</span>.<span>connect</span>(<span>&#34;content.db&#34;</span>)
<span>conn</span>.<span>create_function</span>(<span>&#34;convert_value&#34;</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>convert_value</span>)
<span>conn</span>.<span>execute</span>(<span>&#34;update articles set content = convert_value(content)&#34;</span>)</pre>
<p><code>sqlite-utils convert</code> works by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/blob/cc90745f4e8bb1ac57d8ee973863cfe00c2e4fe5/sqlite_utils/cli.py#L2019-L2028">compiling the code argument</a> to a Python function, registering it with the connection and executing the above SQL query.</p>
<h4>Splitting columns into multiple other columns</h4>
<p>Sometimes when I’m working with a table I find myself wanting to split a column into multiple other columns.</p>
<p>A classic example is locations—if a <code>location</code> column contains <code>latitude,longitude</code> values I’ll often want to split that into separate <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns, so I can visualize the data with <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--multi</code> option lets you do that using <code>sqlite-utils convert</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert data.db places location &#39;
latitude, longitude = value.split(&#34;,&#34;)
return {
    &#34;latitude&#34;: float(latitude),
    &#34;longitude&#34;: float(longitude),
}&#39; --multi
</code></pre>
<p><code>--multi</code> tells the command to expect the Python code to return dictionaries. It will then create new columns in the database corresponding to the keys in those dictionaries and populate them using the results of the transformation.</p>
<p>If the <code>places</code> table started with just a <code>location</code> column, after running the above command the new table schema will look like this:</p>
<div><pre>CREATE TABLE [places] (
    [location] <span>TEXT</span>,
    [latitude] FLOAT,
    [longitude] FLOAT
);</pre></div>
<h4>Common recipes</h4>
<p>This new feature in <code>sqlite-utils</code> actually started life as a separate tool entirely, called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform">sqlite-transform</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the rationale for adding it to <code>sqlite-utils</code> was to avoid confusion between what that tool did and the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-advanced-alter-table/">sqlite-utils transform</a> tool, which does something completely different (applies table transformations that aren’t possible using SQLite’s default <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement). Somewhere along the line I messed up with the naming of the two tools!</p>
<p><code>sqlite-transform</code> bundles a number of useful <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform/blob/main/README.md#parsedate-and-parsedatetime">default transformation recipes</a>, in addition to allowing arbitrary Python code. I ended up making these available in <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> by exposing them as functions that can be called from the command-line code argument like so:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert my.db articles created_at \
    &#39;r.parsedate(value)&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Implementing them as Python functions in this way meant I didn’t need to invent a new command-line mechanism for passing in additional options to the individual recipes—instead, parameters are passed like this:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert my.db articles created_at \
    &#39;r.parsedate(value, dayfirst=True)&#39;
</code></pre>
<h4>Also available in the sqlite_utils Python library</h4>
<p>Almost every feature that is exposed by the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils command-line tool</a> has a matching API in the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite_utils Python library</a>. <code>convert</code> is no exception.</p>
<p>The Python API lets you perform operations like the following:</p>
<pre><span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlite_utils</span>.<span>Database</span>(<span>&#34;dogs.db&#34;</span>)

<span>db</span>[<span>&#34;dogs&#34;</span>].<span>convert</span>(<span>&#34;name&#34;</span>, <span>lambda</span> <span>value</span>: <span>value</span>.<span>upper</span>())</pre>
<p>Any Python callable can be passed to <code>convert</code>, and it will be applied to every value in the specified column—again, like using <code>map()</code> to apply a transformation to every item in an array.</p>
<p>You can also use the Python API to perform more complex operations like the following two examples:</p>
<pre><span># Convert title to upper case only for rows with id &gt; 20</span>
<span>table</span>.<span>convert</span>(
    <span>&#34;title&#34;</span>,
    <span>lambda</span> <span>v</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>upper</span>(),
    <span>where</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;id &gt; :id&#34;</span>,
    <span>where_args</span><span>=</span>{<span>&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span>20</span>}
)

<span># Create two new columns, &#34;upper&#34; and &#34;lower&#34;,</span>
<span># and populate them from the converted title</span>
<span>table</span>.<span>convert</span>(
    <span>&#34;title&#34;</span>,
    <span>lambda</span> <span>v</span>: {
        <span>&#34;upper&#34;</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>upper</span>(),
        <span>&#34;lower&#34;</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>lower</span>()
    }, <span>multi</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>
)</pre>

<h4 id="blog-performance">A more sophisticated example: analyzing log files</h4>
<p>I used the new <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> command earlier today, to debug a performance issue with my blog.</p>
<p>Most of my blog traffic is served via Cloudflare with a 15 minute cache timeout—but occasionally I’ll hit an uncached page, and they had started to feel not quite as snappy as I would expect.</p>
<p>So I dipped into the Heroku dashboard, and saw this pretty sad looking graph:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somehow my 50th percentile was nearly 10 seconds, and my maximum page response time was 23 seconds! Something was clearly very wrong.</p>
<p>I use NGINX as part of my Heroku setup to buffer responses (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/2/nginx-heroku/">Running gunicorn behind nginx on Heroku for buffering and logging</a>), and I have custom NGINX configuration to write to the Heroku logs—mainly to work around a limitation in Heroku’s default logging where it fails to record full user-agents or referrer headers.</p>
<p>I extended that configuration to record the NGINX <code>request_time</code>, <code>upstream_response_time</code>, <code>upstream_connect_time</code> and <code>upstream_header_time</code> variables, which I hoped would help me figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/dd0faaa64c0e361ae1d760894e201cac7b0224a4">applying that change</a> I started seeing Heroku log lines that looked like this:</p>
<p><code>2021-08-05T17:58:28.880469+00:00 app[web.1]: measure#nginx.service=4.212 request=&#34;GET /search/?type=blogmark&amp;page=2&amp;tag=highavailability HTTP/1.1&#34; status_code=404 request_id=25eb296e-e970-4072-b75a-606e11e1db5b remote_addr=&#34;10.1.92.174&#34; forwarded_for=&#34;114.119.136.88, 172.70.142.28&#34; forwarded_proto=&#34;http&#34; via=&#34;1.1 vegur&#34; body_bytes_sent=179 referer=&#34;-&#34; user_agent=&#34;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0;) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)&#34; request_time=&#34;4.212&#34; upstream_response_time=&#34;4.212&#34; upstream_connect_time=&#34;0.000&#34; upstream_header_time=&#34;4.212&#34;;</code></p>
<p>Next step: analyze those log lines.</p>
<p>I ran this command for a few minutes to gather some logs:</p>
<p><code>heroku logs -a simonwillisonblog --tail | grep &#39;measure#nginx.service&#39; &gt; /tmp/log.txt</code></p>
<p>Having collected 488 log lines, the next step was to load them into SQLite.</p>
<p>The <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> command likes to work with JSON, but I just had raw log lines. I used <code>jq</code> to convert each line into a <code>{&#34;line&#34;: &#34;raw log line&#34;}</code> JSON object, then piped that as newline-delimited JSON into <code>sqlite-utils insert</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat /tmp/log.txt | \
    jq --raw-input &#39;{line: .}&#39; --compact-output | \
    sqlite-utils insert /tmp/logs.db log - --nl
</code></pre>
<p><code>jq --raw-input</code> accepts input that is just raw lines of text, not yet valid JSON. <code>&#39;{line: .}&#39;</code> is a tiny <code>jq</code> program that builds <code>{&#34;line&#34;: &#34;raw input&#34;}</code> objects. <code>--compact-output</code> causes <code>jq</code> to output newline-delimited JSON.</p>
<p>Then <code>sqlite-utils insert /tmp/logs.db log - --nl</code> reads that newline-delimited JSON into a new SQLite <code>log</code> table in a <code>logs.db</code> database file (<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-newline-delimited-json">full documentation here</a>).</p>
<p>Now I had a SQLite table with a single column, <code>line</code>. Next step: parse that nasty log format.</p>
<p>To my surprise I couldn’t find an existing Python library for parsing <code>key=value key2=&#34;quoted value&#34;</code> log lines. Instead I had to figure out a regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>([^\s=]+)=(?:&#34;(.*?)&#34;|(\S+))
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s that expression visualized using <a href="https://www.debuggex.com/">Debuggex</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used that regular expression as part of a custom function passed in to the <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert /tmp/logs.db log line --import re --multi &#34;$(cat &lt;&lt;EOD
    r = re.compile(r&#39;([^\s=]+)=(?:&#34;(.*?)&#34;|(\S+))&#39;)
    pairs = {}
    for key, value1, value2 in r.findall(value):
        pairs[key] = value1 or value2
    return pairs
EOD
)&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>(This uses a <code>cat &lt;&lt;EOD</code> trick to avoid having to figure out how to escape the single and double quotes in the Python code for usage in a zsh shell command.)</p>
<p>Using <code>--multi</code> here created new columns for each of the key/value pairs seen in that log file.</p>
<p>One last step: convert the types. The new columns are all of type <code>text</code> but I want to do sorting and arithmetic on them so I need to convert them to integers and floats. I used <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#transforming-tables">sqlite-utils transform</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils transform /tmp/logs.db log \
    --type &#39;measure#nginx.service&#39; float \
    --type &#39;status_code&#39; integer \
    --type &#39;body_bytes_sent&#39; integer \
    --type &#39;request_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_response_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_connect_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_header_time&#39; float
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://simonwillison-net-performance-logs.vercel.app/logs/log">resulting log table</a> (published using <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-publish-vercel">datasette-publish-vercel</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the logs were in Datasette, the problem quickly became apparent when I <a href="https://simonwillison-net-performance-logs.vercel.app/logs/log?_sort_desc=request_time">sorted by request_time</a>: an army of search engine crawlers were hitting deep linked filters in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/5/django-postgresql-faceted-search/">my faceted search engine</a>, like <code>/search/?tag=geolocation&amp;tag=offlineresources&amp;tag=canvas&amp;tag=javascript&amp;tag=performance&amp;tag=dragndrop&amp;tag=crossdomain&amp;tag=mozilla&amp;tag=video&amp;tag=tracemonkey&amp;year=2009&amp;type=blogmark</code>. These are expensive pages to generate! They’re also very unlikely to be in my Cloudflare cache.</p>
<p>Could the answer be as simple as a <code>robots.txt</code> rule blocking access to <code>/search/</code>?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/4c0de5b9f01bb16fc89c587128a276055b0033bb">shipped that change</a> and waited a few hours to see what the impact would be:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It took a while for the crawlers to notice that my <code>robots.txt</code> had changed, but by 8 hours later my site performance was dramatically improved—I’m now seeing 99th percentile of around 450ms, compared to 25 seconds before I shipped the <code>robots.txt</code> change!</p>
<p>With this latest addition, <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> has evolved into a powerful tool for importing, cleaning and re-shaping data—especially when coupled with Datasette in order to explore, analyze and publish the results.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by scientific discoveries that are hanging right in front of our noses. Cryptic species are one such surprise. Sometimes, researchers using genetic sequencing are surprised to discover that a group of animals that all look the same from the outside are actually reproductively isolated from each other; separate twigs on the tree of life. This surprise has happened over and over in the history of natural science. </p>



<p>It turns out such puzzles are frequent among the giant clams. These unusual bivalves are specialists in coral reef environments, growing to large size with the help of symbiotic algae that create sugars through photosynthesis. Within the genus <em>Tridacna </em>there are ~10 accepted species which vary in size, shape, color and mode of life. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tridacna squamosina</em> (right) sitting next to the small giant clam <em>T. maxima</em> (left) on the Israeli Red Sea coast</figcaption></figure>



<p>I specialize in the three species known (so far) from the Red Sea, including the small giant clam <em>Tridacna maxima</em> and the fluted giant clam <em>T. squamosa</em>, which are both found worldwide, all the way from the Red Sea to down past the equator along the Great Barrier Reef. The third local species, <em>T. squamosina </em>is more unusual, so far being only known from the Red Sea (an endemic species). <em>T. squamosina</em> is an example of a cryptic species, having previously been assumed to be a local variant of <em>T. squamosa</em>. It looks pretty similar, with long scutes (flap-like appendages) protruding from its shell, thought to help stabilize it on the flat bottom of loose coral rubble. But unlike <em>T. squamosa</em>, <em>T. squamosina</em> lives exclusively at the top of the reef in the shallowest waters closest to the sun. It has a very angular, zig-zag pattern in its plications (the wavy shapes at the edge of the shell) and a characteristic pair of green stripes where the soft tissue meets the edges of the shell.

<p>It was only first described in detail in the early 2000s, when an international team of researchers figured out using genetic sequencing that it was a distinct species and named it <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220800969X" target="_blank">T. costata</a></em>. They noted that in their surveys all around the shores of the Red Sea, they only found 13 live specimens, making it an extremely rare and possibly endangered species. Fossil specimens on local reefs appeared to be much more common, suggesting it had a much larger population in the past. Then in 2011, another team at the Natural History Museum in Vienna <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291351279_Tridacna_Chametrachea_costata_ROA-QUIAOIT_KOCHZIUS_JANTZEN_AL-ZIBDAH_RICHTER_from_the_Red_Sea_a_Junior_synonym_of_Tridacna_squamosina_STURANY_1899_Bivalvia_Tridacnidae" target="_blank">discovered </a>a shell of one had been forgotten in its collection for over 100 years. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Sturany" target="_blank">Rudolf Sturany,</a> the researcher on the 1895 research cruise who had originally collected the clam, had called it <em>T. squamosina</em>. </p>

<p>In taxonomy (the science of naming and classifying organisms), the first team to name the species wins, so the name <em>T. costata</em> was synonymized (retired) in favor of the earlier name <em>T. squamosina</em>, which became the name of record. It must be annoying to spend so much time working to name a species and then discover you had been scooped over a century before! But such is science. </p>



<figure><figcaption>A mystery clam thought to be <em>T. squamosina</em>, later identified as <em>T. elongatissima</em> found off of Mozambique by iNaturalist user <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/33747678">bewambay </a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The strange part was that there were some murmurs over the last few years that <em>T. squamosina</em> was not only found in the Red Sea, but also had been seen along the coast of Africa as far south as Kenya, Mozambique and Madagascar. Divers and snorkelers had taken pictures of a giant clam that did indeed look strangely like <em>T. squamosina</em>, with a zigzag shell opening and green stripes at the edge of its tissue. But some aspects of these individuals seemed off. In the Red Sea, <em>T. squamosina</em> lives freely, not embedded in the coral as these pictures showed, and the geometry of the angles of the shell seemed a bit different. It also would be difficult for <em>T. squamosina</em> to be connected in population from the Red Sea all the way South to Mozambique, as there are natural barriers which would prevent its planktonic larvae from riding currents to intermix between the two regions. When populations are separated by a barrier, the flow of genes between them is cut off and evolution begins to separate the populations from each other until they are separate species, a process called allopatric speciation.</p>

<p>I figured that someday, researchers would collect tissue samples from these mystery clams to settle whether they were actually <em>T. squamosina</em> or something else.  And this year, a team <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.13797?casa_token=judEiv9BdwgAAAAA%3AiNdNr-KL8f3IPmPqJAMwrjNoHGQURjZQztBulAahXxi_Hx9HHuvWTOW_tSwNtf8z_YOpXtXCelRaow">did just that</a>, traveling along the coast of Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya and other places, collecting samples of tissue to compare how all the different clams they saw were related in a family tree. They genetically sequenced these “clamples” and in the process, found that the mystery clams were a new cryptic species, which they called <em>T. elongatissima</em>!</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>Shells of <em>T. elongatissima </em>from the Fauvelot et al. 2020 paper</figcaption></figure></div>



<figure><figcaption>For comparison, a shell of <em>T. squamosina</em> collected off of Sinai, Egypt. You can see why they’re easy to mix up!</figcaption></figure>



<p>T<em>. elongatissima </em>closely resembles <em>T. squamosina</em>, and they are sister species on the bivalve family tree. It’s hard to tell them apart without training. Even a professional would probably mix some of them up if they were all placed sitting next to each other. The major differences appear to relate to shell shape, with <em>T. elongatissima</em> having a less symmetrical shell than <em>T. squamosina</em>, and a bigger opening at the rear hinge for a foot to poke through. The symmetrical shell and closing of the foot opening may represent changes that <em>T. squamosina</em> took on to adapt to be able to sit freely on the bottom, rather than embedding in the coral like <em>T. elongatissima</em> seems to prefer. If you’ve read this far, you may be thinking “Who cares? A clam’s a clam and these look practically the same. Aren’t you just splitting clams at this point?” At the end of the day, a species is a man-made concept; an organizing tool for use by us humans. Species are the characters in our reconstruction of the history of the world. What can we learn about the world by having identified this species <em>T. elongatissima</em>?</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>A giant clam family tree! Notice <em>T. squamosina</em> and <em>T. elongatissima </em>right next to each other.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers behind the new paper discuss that based on statistical analyses of the genetic differences between the species, the most recent common ancestor for <em>T. elongatissima</em> and <em>T. squamosina</em> probably lived more than 1.4 million years ago! Some researchers have previously suggested that <em>T. squamosina</em> probably began its development as a separate species due to geographic isolation by low sea level, caused by repeated glaciations. With so much water trapped as ice on land during this period, the narrow Strait of Bab al Mandab, currently the gateway to the Red Sea, became a land barrier as sea level fell (kind of like opposite of the Bering Sea land bridge that formed allowing humans to migrate to the Americas). Ancestral clams trapped on the Northern end of this barrier were proposed to have evolved to become the rare <em>T. squamosina</em>. </p>



<p>This has occurred with a variety of species that became Red Sea endemics (meaning they are unique species that evolved in the Red Sea and are found nowhere else), including a unique crown of thorns starfish. The issue is that during this time of low sea level, the Red Sea went through periods where it was a rather unfriendly place for clams to live. All sorts of creatures went extinct in the period when the sea was repeatedly cut off, because the water became extremely salty, along with other unfriendly changes. So it’s unlikely <em>T. squamosina</em> would be present for us to see today if it only lived in the Red Sea throughout the entire length of time.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>A map from Fauvelot et al. 2020 showing the distributions of different giant clams the researchers identified along the coasts of Africa and the Red Sea. Notice the bright red dots representing <em>T. squamosina</em>, only found in the Red Sea, while green dots represent <em>T. elongatissima</em>. Notice how the currents (arrows) seem to meet and then go offshore from Kenya. More on that in the next paragraph. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers of this new paper propose that <em>T. squamosina</em> was more likely to have initially branched off due to the barrier of the Horn of Africa. The seas off of Kenya and Somalia harbor a meeting of southward and northward currents which then group and head offshore, away from the reefs that giant clam larvae are trying to get to. So any tiny floating planktonic clam larvae would experience a strong “headwind” preventing them from crossing that point. It would also mean that during times that the Red Sea was not a happy place to be a clam, <em>T. squamosina</em> may have found refuge on the coasts of places like Eritrea, Oman and possibly even as far as Pakistan. During times when sea levels rose and Red Sea conditions became friendlier, it recolonized the area. </p>



<p>As far as we know, the Red Sea is the only place<em> T. squamosina </em>is now found, but it may well be present elsewhere like Yemen or Oman. If <em>T. squamosina</em> was found in other regions, it would be tremendously important for its conservation. Right now, the species is thought to be extremely rare, with a very small native range. If it inhabited a broader area, that would mean more reservoirs of genetic diversity. This would reduce the odds that it will go extinct as reefs are put under stress from climate change, pollution and overharvesting. To survive as a species, it helps to not put all your eggs in one basket. If you’re only found in one small place, it increases the chances that a disaster (like climate change) will wipe you out. </p>



<p>The only way we will know for sure is to visit reefs in understudied places like Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, Eritrea and Somalia, to understand the richness of the giant clams present. These areas are understudied for various reasons: lack of research funding for non-Western researchers, lack of interest from the scientific community too focused on familiar places, and geopolitical situations that make it difficult to conduct research. But I hope someday to collaborate with people in these countries to better understand the giant clams present in such understudied regions of the globe. It is virtually certain that there are more species of giant clams, both alive and as fossils, waiting to be discovered. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>I</span></span><span>n July 2008, I rented a small yellow car in Tucson, Arizona, and drove it south towards Tombstone. My passengers included an entomologist and two microbial geneticists, and I was following a white van with government plates carrying nine more geneticists. We also had 500 plastic bags, a vacuum flask of dry ice, and 350 cryogenic vials, each the size and shape of a pencil stub. We had two days to get 10,000 termites.</span></p><p>The goal was to sequence the genes of the microbes in their guts. Because termites are famously good at eating wood, those genes were attractive to government labs trying to turn wood and grass into biofuels (“grassoline”). The white van and the geneticists all belonged to the US Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute. Perhaps by seeing exactly how termites break down wood, we’d be able to do it too.</p><p>We stopped in the Coronado national forest, near the border with Mexico. I lifted a rock and saw a glint of glossy exoskeleton flowing into some little tunnels. I dropped to my knees and began sucking on an aspirator, a disgusting process that stimulated saliva production and made me dizzy. Two minutes later, there were no more termites on the ground and I had about 25 in the test tube attached to the aspirator.</p><p>But my pale termites were disappointing. When I separated one from the clutch, it was less substantial than a baby’s fingernail clipping. Doddering around blindly, it waved the flimsy antennae on its bulbous head. In its stubby, translucent body I could almost see its coiled guts – and presumably whatever it had eaten for lunch. Ants have snazzy bodies with three sections, highlighted by narrow waists, like a pinup model’s, between the segments. Termites, which are no relation to ants or bees, have round, eyeless heads, thick necks and teardrop-shaped bodies. And they long ago lost cockroaches’ repulsive dignity, gnarly size and gleaming chitinous armour. I put the termite back in the test tube.</p><p>What had I just sucked up? My little gang of 25 was incapable of doing much of anything. Without a colony, they had nowhere to bring food to, and thus no reason to forage. Without a crowd of soldiers, they couldn’t defend themselves. Without a queen, they couldn’t reproduce. Twenty-five termites are insignificant in the scheme of life and death and reproduction. Meaningless. What’s more, they were clinging to one another, making an icky beige rope of termite heads, bodies and legs reminiscent of the game Barrel of Monkeys. In the miniature scrum I couldn’t even see a single termite – they looked like a clot, not a group of individuals. Or perhaps I had found a single individual who happened to have 25 selves.</p><p>I had stumbled into one of the big questions termites pose, which is, roughly, what is “one” termite? Is it one individual termite? Is it one termite with its symbiotic gut microbes, an entity that can eat wood but cannot reproduce on its own? Or is it a colony, a whole living, breathing structure, occupied by a few million related individuals and a gazillion symbionts who collectively constitute “one”?</p><p>The issue of one is profound in every direction, with evolutionary, ecological and existential implications. By the end of that day I had a basic idea that the fewer I saw, the more termites there might be. Where I had thought of landscapes as the product of growth, on that afternoon they inverted to become the opposite: the remainders left behind by the forces of persistent and massive chewing. The sky was no longer the sky, but the blue stuff that is visible after the screening brush and cacti have been eaten away. Termites have made the world by unmaking parts of it. They are the architects of negative space. The engineers of not.</p><hr/><p><span><span>N</span></span><span>obody loves termites, even though other social insects such as ants and bees are admired for their organisation, thrift and industry. Parents dress their children in bee costumes. Ants star in movies and video games. But termites are never more than crude cartoons on the side of exterminators’ vans. Termite studies are likewise a backwater, funded mostly by government agencies and companies with names such as Terminix. Between 2000 and 2013, 6,373 papers about termites were published; 49% were about how to kill them.</span></p><p>Every story about termites mentions that they consume somewhere between $1.5bn (£1.1bn) and $20bn in US property every year. Termites’ offence is often described as the eating of “private” property, which makes them sound like anticapitalist anarchists. While termites are truly subversive, it’s fair to point out that they will eat anything pulpy. They find money itself to be very tasty. In 2011 they broke into <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13194864" title="" data-link-name="in body link">an Indian bank and ate 10m rupees</a> (then £137,000) in banknotes. In 2013 they ate 400,000 yuan (then £45,000) that a woman in Guangdong had <a href="http://shanghaiist.com/2013/06/10/termites_eat_guangdong_grandmothers_life_savings/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">wrapped in plastic and hidden in a wooden drawer</a>.</p><figure id="e83387f1-9fd2-4133-85f3-62731b8a691b"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a67e22fb092d40a577e4276562255a2f 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c2d11382d2334df875ff45f235893a4d 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=fce44f2afdf10eca07c94cf0c94be5d2 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=fce44f2afdf10eca07c94cf0c94be5d2 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=615708eb93e2863d48473c7a61120dce 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=930277c9d5c25ebd4a23f95a61576dfd 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=4b3429b5c79891c2c806a5423c9753e6 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=18395152240b8c5fbb34993e2e64f644 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d06fe74a3891b8cc5ca8b15a5db16489 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448ef50fe9a1906c4242829b799f18fd 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448ef50fe9a1906c4242829b799f18fd 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d019a70f1c9c127153429fa3012479f2 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=60d17cecf858c18c22fde6c0f624ace7 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=75bb58ce1ca04cf6fb26b5322d010a3b 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Harvester termite workers.</span> Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Another statistic seems relevant: termites outweigh us 10 to one. For every 60kg human you, according to the termite expert David Bignell, there are 600kg of them. We may live in our own self-titled epoch – the Anthropocene – but termites run the dirt. They are our underappreciated underlords, key players in a vast planetary conspiracy of disassembly and decay. If termites, ants and bees were to go on strike, the tropics’ pyramid of interdependence would collapse into infertility, the world’s most important rivers would silt up and the oceans would become toxic. Game over.</p><p>By the end of our termite-collecting trip we had 8,000 termites in plastic tubs and bags, but they needed to be labelled and stored in dry ice before going to California to be sequenced. Once frozen in the vacuum flask, the termites were on their way to immortality: a collection of genetic code sitting in some database on a server somewhere, intellectual property, a sequence of nucleotides that might solve a wicked problem some day.</p><p>We were on the border between natural history and an unnatural future. We weren’t alone: all over the world, scientists are trying to find biology’s underlying rules and put them to use. They’re doing it with genes, behaviours, metabolisms and ecosystems. They’re seeing nature in new ways, and at the same time they’re trying to reinvent it and put it to work for us. In the future, we will harness nature’s tiniest life forms – microbes and insects – both their systems of organisation and control, and their genes and chemical capabilities. This fits with our paradoxical desire to have a lighter footprint on the Earth while having greater control over its processes.</p><p>At the core of this project is the provocative dream of changing biology into a predictive science, much the way physics started as the observation of phenomena such as gravity and then became the science of making plans for the atom bomb. Will there be termite bombs?</p><p>Termites, I came to understand, are the poster bug for the 21st century – a little guide to really big ideas.</p><hr/><p><span><span>T</span></span><span>ermite colonies begin theatrically on rainy evenings. Small holes open in the sides of existing termite homes and largish, winged termites emerge, shake out their sticky wings, and fly. In northern California, termites of the genus <em>Reticulitermes</em> suddenly appear on the sides of buildings they inhabit. In South America, <em>Nasutitermes</em> shower down from nests in the trees. In New Orleans, Formosan termites, of the genus <em>Coptotermes</em>, burp from colonies in the ground and take to the air in swarms so dense they show up on weather radar. In Namibia, giant <em>Macrotermes</em> mounds seem to spring a leak, spilling froths of winged termites down their sides.</span></p><p>In the mound, most of the termites are eyeless and wingless, but the fertile termites who leave the mound on this night have eyes and what at first appears to be one single translucent teardrop-shaped wing. When they are ready to fly, this single wing, still soft and moist, fans out into four. Called “alates”, these termites are like fragile balsa-wood glider planes: just sturdy enough to cruise briefly before crash-landing their payloads of genes.</p><p>Male and female find each other and scuttle off to dig a burrow where they will mate. At first the two termites will be alone in their dark hole. Christine Nalepa, Theo Evans and Michael Lenz have written that termite parents bite off the ends of their antennae, which may make them better at raising their young. Antennae give termites lots of sensory information, and biting off the segments toward the ends could reduce that stimulation, making it easier to live in a tiny burrow with a few million children.</p><p>After she has laid her first eggs, the queen cleans them often to remove harmful fungi until they hatch as nymphs about three weeks later. The nymphs will moult grow and develop, but under the influence of the queen’s pheromone, most of them won’t fully mature, remaining permanent stay-at-home preteens – eyeless, wingless helpers.</p><p>Males and females alike will spend their time gathering food, tending eggs, building the nest deeper into the ground and eventually tending a fungus. As the family grows bigger, some morph into soldiers; their heads grow larger, dark-coloured and hard in a distinctive way, depending on their species. Thereafter they must be fed by their siblings the workers. Soldiers appear to return the favour by dosing the colony with antimicrobial secretions that help it resist disease.</p><p>Over time, in the small smooth dirt room where she lives, the queen’s body becomes “physogastric”, her abdomen swelling to the size of my thumb, constricted by taut black bands remaining from her old exoskeleton so she looks like a soft sausage that has been carelessly bound with string. Her head, thorax and legs remain tiny. Immobilised, except for the ability to wave her legs and bobble her head, she lays eggs at the rate of one every three or so seconds. The king stays by her. Her children lick off the liquid that appears on her skin, feed her and care for the eggs.</p><p>Or at least, that’s life for some <em>Macrotermes</em> queens (the genus found in Africa and south-east Asia, that builds its mound around a massive fungus). There are, however, at least 3,000 named termite species, and thus at least 3,000 ways to be termites. Some have multiple queens; some have cloned kings or queens; some are, improbably, founded by two male termites. One species doesn’t really have workers. Different species eat wood, others eat grass and some eat dirt. <em>Macrotermes</em> tend a fungus, but most others do not. All termites, though, live in their own version of a big commune.</p><figure id="85ea937f-a4fc-4e07-9042-90309b0df869"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a14c3a55bb07a0d26d12aa70eb4e332e 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=dfe296c906aa5c29bc95775b91044b1a 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0dbcdf2acd565e4b728ca4856b47a023 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0dbcdf2acd565e4b728ca4856b47a023 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7cc4ef19257e98dc2391e2dad9617914 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7acd4060e0c0435b7dc577a0f8e2e916 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=3d48682bd0e6949cf2b4613a3d45bde5 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=862e30865cbaa1d5ab33b2ef4512ba71 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f58e8e7d27db59265096b3bf4ac1909a 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=afbbd0828db138efa263f4a1ddf9906a 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=afbbd0828db138efa263f4a1ddf9906a 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a3f3c804c2543169836a4e862d72aac1 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f8a0a2c3f2cec72a910a73cf5f355a14 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=18b8928912eaf12b34cca4cfb3d00ce4 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Zebras by a termite mound in Okonjima, Namibia.</span> Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption></figure><p>The South African writer Eugène Marais spent many years peering into their mounds and wrote The Soul of the White Ant, originally published in English in 1937. Marais called the termite mound a “composite animal”, uniting the millions of sterile workers, the soldiers, the fat queen and the king with the dirt structure of the mound itself into a single body. “You will need to learn a new alphabet,” he warned his readers before leading them in. The hard-packed dirt on the outside of the mound, he said, is a skin constructed by termites, which build passageways inside that allow the mound to breathe – like a lung. The organism’s stomach is the symbiotic fungus that sits in catacombs under the mound, digesting grasses delivered by termites. The mound’s “mouth” can be found in the hundreds of foraging tunnels the termites construct through the surrounding landscape. Because they carry nutrients and rebuild the mound, the sterile workers resemble blood cells. The mound’s “immune system” is the soldiers, who rush to defend the space whenever it is invaded.</p><p>To Marais, the queen was no Victoria, but instead a captive ovary, walled into a chamber no bigger than her swollen, sweating body. Marais imagined that eventually the mound would evolve into a being that could move across the veldt – very slowly in its dirt skin – a monster hybrid of soil and soul. Marais’s insight wasn’t original, and many scientists had taken to calling such social arrangements of termites, bees and ants “superorganisms”. The originator of the term was the entomologist William Wheeler, the founder of the study of ants in the US, author of a 1911 article called The Ant-Colony as an Organism.</p><p>For a time, superorganisms were all the rage. The concept dealt neatly with what Charles Darwin had called the “problem” with social insects. Darwin’s theory of evolution proposed that natural selection worked on individuals and the fittest individuals bred with others similarly fit to their ecological niche, while the less fit were less likely to reproduce. The problem with social insects was that while single termites seem to be individuals, they do not function as such. Only the queen and king of a colony breed, so who was the “individual”? By declaring the whole colony the individual, Wheeler said its members made up “a living whole bent on preserving its moving equilibrium and its integrity”.</p><p>In the late 1920s and early 30s, the paradigm of the superorganism grew colossal. Instead of studying individual trees, biologists studied forests as superorganisms. By 1931, the concept snuck into popular culture when Aldous Huxley reportedly based the dictatorship in Brave New World on humans as social insects, with five castes. Wheeler proposed that “trophallaxis” – a word he invented for the way insects regurgitate and share food among themselves – was the secret sauce, the superglue of societies both insect and human, and the foundation of economics. But even during the superorganism’s heyday, Marais was alone in his assertion that the mound had a soul.</p><hr/><p><span><span>I</span></span><span>n Namibia, I went to meet J Scott Turner, an American biologist who has spent decades studying how and why termites build their mounds. It took Turner years of experiments to show that mounds could work a bit like lungs, with interconnected chambers taking advantage of fluctuations in wind speed. Air moves back and forth through the porous dirt skin of the mound by two systems: in big puffs driven by buoyant gases rising from the hot fungus nest (like the sharp intake of breath from the diaphragm), and in small puffs, the way air wheezily diffuses between alveoli in your lungs. Turner suspected that the termites themselves circulated air as they moved, like mobile alveoli. This insight was an entirely new way of thinking about the problem. The mound was not a simple structure where air happened to move, but a continuously morphing complex contraption consisting of dirt and termites together manipulating airflow.</span></p><p>Termites who spend a year building an average mound of 3 metres have just built, in comparison to their size, the Empire State Building. Those who build taller mounds, at nearly 5 metres, have just built the Burj Khalifa in Dubai – 830 metres and 163 floors of vertigo – with no architect and no structural engineer. Such unthinking, seat-of-the-pants design is not possible for humans, who required squads of professionals, advanced equipment and 7,500 people working for six years to build the Burj Khalifa. Working with Turner, engineer Rupert Soar hoped to harness the powerful constructive groupthink that comes from the tiny mouths of termites and their even tinier brains to build structures in remote environments such as Mars. But there were issues: termites, he said, engineer to the point of collapse.</p><p>One morning a JCB arrived and Turner directed it to a mound. The JCB’s great blade came down on the top of the mound with a hollow whomp, the first note of a funny little concert. Half the mound fell away with a tumbling clinking clatter – as the shards hit different layers of cured mud they played a tune like a soft xylophone. We pushed in close, enveloped by the familiar smell of socks and bread.</p><p>What was left of the mound was a ruined hierarchy. Dirt shards and fungus combs and sculpted mud plinked downward, while termites ran every which way, at first as a sort of gauzy net. Soon they had organised themselves into small streams, and within 10 minutes those streams had consolidated into rivers of running insects. As order was restored, I could see the elaborate scheme of tunnels, rooms, chambers and fungus hidden under the dirt exterior. The spectacle was genuinely awesome – as in jaw-dropping and appalling.</p><p>The top of the mound was hollow, with wide vertical tunnels. The interiors of these tunnels were very smooth, and they segued in and out of each other in ropey vertiginous columns like a sloppy braid. Termites make the mounds by first piling up dirt and then removing it strategically in the tunnels. Eyeless, they use their antennae to feel for smoothness, and in the big tunnels they remove everything that is rough. They may even hear the tunnel’s shape.</p><p>Termites are often compared to architects for the way they build their mounds, but that is misleading because they don’t have plans or a global vision. What they really have is an aesthetic, an innate sense of how things should feel. When the top of the spire was first ripped off, there were just a few termites in the solitary tunnels at the top, probably listening to the clopping of their own six feet. But cutting into the top allowed in lots of fresh air at once, and activated an alarm system. Some termites ran away from the hole, agitating their brothers and sisters so they could help with repairs. Thousands of worker termites followed the smell of fresh air to find the hole, carrying balls of dirt in their mouths. Within minutes of the JCB strike, streams of termites canvassed the broken side of the mound, moving in a frantic start-stop pattern like a shaky old animated cartoon. I leaned in further and could see that each termite put its ball of dirt down on a ball left by the previous termite, wiggled his or her head, perhaps to get the ball to stick, and then backed away. Where there were two balls there were soon 20 and then 200, then 2,000. Some of these stacks joined up with other stacks at the perimeter of the breaks in the mound to form little bumpy, frilly walls.</p><p>Once the area was walled off, the signal from the fresh air would stop and the termites would fill the internal space with more dirt balls and small tunnels, making a sort of spongy layer. Later they would either block it off entirely or would hollow it out and remodel it. The JCB came back in for another swipe, taking away the dirt below the mound to reveal the system of horizontal galleries, tunnels and chambers where the termites live. It reminded me of those diagrams of cruise ships, visualised from the side, with small rooms packed together in a strict hierarchy of function and status from ballrooms and cafeterias to VIP staterooms and steerage bunks. The colony’s hierarchy is not money, of course, but the things that enable its survival: reproduction, child care, food supply and food processing. Some rooms are large, with vaulted ceilings, and walls and floors the texture of tortilla chips. When I looked closely, I could see that they were not so much rooms as places where many foraging tunnels crossed, like the grand concourses of old train stations. Deep within this area was a small capsule where the king and queen lived, making eggs, which were carried to nearby nurseries.</p><hr/><p><span><span>B</span></span><span>elow the mound lives the fungus, digesting grass. All termites use symbiotic collectives of bacteria and other microbes to digest cellulose for them, but <em>Macrotermes</em> outsource the major work to a fungus.</span></p><p>In some senses the fungus functions as a stomach, but it also has power reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz. Under the mound and around the nest sit hundreds of little rooms, each containing fungus comb. This comb is made of millions of mouthfuls of chewed dry grass, excreted as pseudofaeces and carefully assembled into a maze. The comb roughly resembles graham cracker pie crust, although it varies in colour from delicious beige to decrepit black. The termites inoculate it with a fungus that they have been cohabiting with for more than 30m years.</p><figure id="8216da2a-98e0-4bef-a90a-3f238cd56767"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0e8bc0b05828f622db77ce49c8641c49 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f686bd78809cae041cd9ac930c02d70a 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=728b65578e2afa596fd838bfe81bbdc1 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=728b65578e2afa596fd838bfe81bbdc1 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c5072c0ec817a61d0d10006d72b7a374 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=66ab8d14acea75369fc7a0afaa059852 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=b870c719cfcee7b9bc6fda3f2aebd1e6 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e007a833f30232f9f0fec2b83426eb9d 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2e5d7e8b75a031f7fce722dee51151c3 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8feedc72d4d589927ffbef09aee5b74 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8feedc72d4d589927ffbef09aee5b74 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=02ba6c656bc445997eff474e79c12539 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2c459ec3453839ff4eb1db37f58d6042 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=33cefe37133f96408710b346e1e9c3b8 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Isoptera termites.</span> Photograph: Bryan Mullennix/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>You can pull the fungus combs out of their little rooms as if you were pulling drawers from a doll’s wardrobe. The comb maze wiggles like the folds of a brain, with the hard, wrinkly piles of chewed grass making the gyri and leaving sulci-ish gaps in between. This is not an accident: as with a brain, the comb design increases the surface area of the structure. Within the gaps are what look like tiny white balloons, which is the fungus blooming. There is nothing accidental about this relationship either, or the construction that holds it: the details are so fine we can barely take them in. The bottom of the fungus comb stands on peg-like legs, little nubbins that hold it up just enough to let air circulate through. One of the grad students beat a small stick against the floors of the fungus galleries, playing something that was almost a tune.</p><p>The symbiotic relationship between <em>Macrotermes</em> and the fungus is tight: workers scour the landscape for dry grass, quickly run it through their guts, then place and inoculate each ball to suit the fungus’s picky temperament, tend the comb and snarfle the fungus and its sugars before distributing the goodies to the rest of the family. Then the workers run off to gather more grass for the fungus. Termite and <em>Termitomyces</em> fungus are so interrelated that it’s hard to tell where the mushroom ends and the termite picks up, but within their codependence is a sort of frenemy-type rivalry. (Fungi are capable of deliberately tricking termites. One invasive fungus in termite colonies in the US and Japan pretends to be a termite egg, going so far as to secrete the chemical lysozyme, which the termites use to recognise their eggs. For reasons that are not clear, colonies filled with impostor “eggs” are no less healthy than those without them.)</p><p>Prejudiced by our human sense of a hierarchy of the animate termites over inanimate mushrooms, we would be inclined to believe that the termites control the fungus. But the fungus is much larger than the termites – both in size and energy production: Turner estimates that its metabolism is about eight times bigger than that of the termites in the mound. “I like to tell people that this is not a termite-built structure; it’s a fungus-built structure,” he says, chuckling. It is possible that the fungus has kidnapped the termites. It’s even possible that the fungus has put out a template of chemical smells that stimulates the termites to build the mound itself. As I peered at the white nodules, I began to sneeze violently, sometimes with big gasping whoops, and something – it’s hard to even call it a thought, but a particle of one – flitted through my subconscious before flying out of my nose: the fungus is very powerful.</p><p>My admiration for the fungus only grew when I learned that Namibian farmers estimate that every <em>Macrotermes</em> mound – which contains just 5kg of termites – eats as much dead grass as a 400kg cow. Late in the day, one of the scientists used a pickaxe to pop the royal chamber out of the nest – the whole complex was the size and shape of a squashed soccer ball, but made of hard-packed finely grained dirt. He cracked it open, revealing the king and queen in a hollow space the size of a cough-drop tin. The chamber had holes on the sides, allowing air and smaller termites to pass through. The king was large and dark compared to the workers, but the queen was huge – as big as my finger. Her legs and upper body waggled but barely budged the fluid-filled sac of her lower body, which pulsed erratically, as though she was a toothpaste tube squeezed by an unseen hand. Her skin was shiny and translucent and the fats inside her swirled like pearly cream dribbled into coffee.</p><p>Everyone shuddered: the queen is viscerally repulsive. She offends our sensibilities and she is monstrous. I think the first stimulus to shudder is a reflexive reaction to her body’s pulses and swirls. But then a more intellectual sense of her horror kicks in. “She’s not a queen; she’s a slave,” said Eugene Marais, a Namibian entomologist working with Turner (no relation to the writer of the famous work on termites). Captive of her body, of her children, of the structure of the mound she conspired to build.</p><p>Even then, the queen’s more shocking aspects are hidden from us. Her truly stupendous fertility – creating millions of eggs over as long as 20 years – is something we can only infer. Some species of termite queens can clone themselves by producing eggs with no entry-ways for sperm, which then mature into sexual queens with only their mother’s chromosomes, duplicated inside the egg nucleus, to furnish a full set. Imperfect copies of the queen, these knockoffs are good enough to get the job done. Parthenogenesis allows the queen to live, in insect years, pretty close to for ever.</p><figure id="2fb15fc6-5beb-4ce1-81ec-1b36d549a2dc"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-47 | 47" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></figure><p>And yet we do refer to her as a queen. I wondered why. Marais said that when early European naturalists looked into beehives and termite mounds, they saw the monarchies they came from – with workers, soldiers, and kings and queens. It was misleading, he said, and kept us from really understanding what was going on with termites. For scientists, the great danger of seeing social insects anthropomorphically is that it obscures their true insect-ness. In the 1970s and 80s, when the ant scientist Deborah Gordon began studying massive ant colonies in the American south-west, scientists described the ant colony as “a factory with assembly-line workers, each performing a single task over and over”. Gordon felt the factory model clouded what she actually saw in her colonies – a tremendous variation in the tasks that ants were doing. Rather than having intrinsic task assignments, she saw that ants changed their behaviour based on clues they got from the environment and one another. Gordon suggested that we should stop thinking of ants as factory workers and instead think of them as “the firing patterns of neurons in the brain”, where simple environmental information gives cues that make the individuals work for the whole, without central regulation.</p><p>And so, these days, one scientific metaphor for the inscrutable termite is a neuron in a giant crawling brain.</p><p>Back in the 1930s, the other Marais didn’t write a termite science book, but a book about how humans could understand termites – as a bug, a body, a soul, a force on the landscape. Looking at termites this way changed how I see the world, science, the future and myself.</p><p><em>This is an edited extract from Underbug: An Obsessive Tale of Termites and Technology by Lisa Margonelli (Oneworld, £16.99).

												<p><em>Human evolution favors energy conservation, but has our evolution worked against us since inactivity is linked to health risks? A new study of a modern hunter-gatherer society finds that <strong>how</strong> people rest matters.</em></p>
<p>Contact: Emily Gersema, (213) 712-3168 or [<a href="mailto:gersema@usc.edu">gersema@usc.edu</a>]</p>
<p>Standing desks are so passé. It’s time for squatting desks.</p>
<p>A USC-led study shows that squatting and kneeling may be important resting positions in human evolution — and even for modern human health.</p>
<p>Sitting for hours a day is linked to some health risks, including cardiovascular disease, likely because it involves low muscle activity and low muscle metabolism. However, these risks seem paradoxical. For humans, evolutionary pressures favor conserving energy. Spending a lot of time sitting would seem to accomplish that goal. So, why should sitting be so harmful?</p>
<p>The USC-led team has shown that resting postures used before the invention of chairs — like squatting and kneeling — may hold the answer, as they involve higher levels of muscle activity then chair-sitting. These more active rest postures may help protect people from the harmful effects of inactivity.</p>
<p>“We tend to think human physiology is adapted to the conditions in which we evolved,” said David Raichlen [https://pressroom.usc.edu/david-raichlen/], a professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “So, we assumed that if inactivity is harmful, our evolutionary history would not have included much time spent sitting the way we do today.”</p>
<p>The study was published on March 9 in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/03/1911868117" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;,&#39;outbound-article&#39;,&#39;http://www.pnas.org&#39;]);"><strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>How you rest matters</strong></p>
<p>To better understand the evolution of sedentary behaviors, the scientists studied inactivity in a group of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, the Hadza, who have a lifestyle that is similar in some ways with how humans lived in the past.</p>
<p>For the study, Hadza participants wore devices that measured physical activity and periods of rest. The scientists found that they had high levels of physical activity — over three times as much as the 22 minutes per day advised by U.S. federal health guidelines.</p>
<p>But the scientists also found that they had high levels of inactivity.</p>
<p>In fact, the Hadza are sedentary for about as much time — around 9 to 10 hours per day — as humans in more developed countries. However, they appear to lack the markers of chronic diseases that are associated, in industrialized societies, with long periods of sitting. The reason for this disconnect may lie in how they rest.</p>
<p>“Even though there were long periods of inactivity, one of the key differences we noticed is that the Hadza are often resting in postures that require their muscles to maintain light levels of activity — either in a squat or kneeling,” Raichlen said.</p>
<p>In addition to tracking activity and inactivity, the researchers used specialized equipment to measure muscle activity in the lower limbs in different resting postures. Squatting involved more muscle activity compared to sitting.</p>

<p><strong>The evolution of inactivity</strong></p>
<p>The researchers suggested that because the Hadza squat and kneel and have high levels of movement when not at rest, they may have</p>

And that may be why they don’t develop risk markers for heart and metabolic diseases. Credit: David Raichlen, USC, and Brian Wood, UCLA</em></p></div>
<p>more consistent muscle activity throughout the day. This could reduce the health risks associated with sedentary behavior.</p>
<p>“Being a couch potato — or even sitting in an office chair — requires less muscle activity than squatting or kneeling,” Raichlen said. “Since light levels of muscle activity require fuel, which generally means burning fats, then squatting and kneeling postures may not be as harmful as sitting in chairs.”</p>
<p>In developed countries, humans spend inactive periods sitting on their duffs in chairs, recliners or sofas, so the only time they activate their leg muscles is when they bend their knees to slide into the seat. On average, people in more industrialized societies, including the United States and Europe, spend about nine hours per day sitting.</p>
<p>“Preferences or behaviors that conserve energy have been key to our species’ evolutionary success,” said Brian Wood, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked with the Hazda people for 16 years. “But when environments change rapidly, these same preferences can lead to less optimal outcomes. Prolonged sitting is one example.”</p>
<p>The scientists dubbed this the “Inactivity Mismatch Hypothesis.”</p>
<p>“Replacing chair sitting and associated muscular inactivity with more sustained active rest postures may represent a behavioral paradigm that should be explored in future experimental work,” they wrote. Resolving this inactivity mismatch with our evolutionary past could pay off in better health today.</p>
<p>“Squatting is not a likely alternative,” Raichlen said, “but spending more time in postures that at least require some low-level muscle activity could be good for our health.”</p>

<p>In addition to Raichlen and Wood, other co-authors involved in the study were: Herman Pontzer of Duke University; Ted W. Zderic of University of Texas; Jacob A. Harris of Arizona State University; Audax Z. P. Mabulla of University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania; and Marc Hamilton of the University of Texas.</p>
<p>The study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, the University of Arizona Bio5 Institute and the American Diabetes Association.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 1960 JOHN KENNEDY</small>, the Democratic candidate for the American presidency, accused the incumbent Republican administration of having allowed a “missile gap” to open up between America and the Soviet Union. The idea seemed plausible. The Soviet Union’s success in launching the first satellite, <em>Sputnik</em>, on a rocket which could double as an intercontinental ballistic missile (<small>ICBM</small>) had naturally led to speculation that it was far ahead of America in the deployment of such weapons.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Open-source%20intelligence-34ed53d1bb018beec33d7781324fb2f8.mp3" title="Open-source intelligence challenges state monopolies on information" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p>Plausible, but wrong. Soviet <small>ICBM</small>s could be counted on the fingers of one hand. But although, by the final days of the campaign, President Dwight Eisenhower had strong evidence of this from the <small>CORONA</small> spy-satellite programme, he could make no mention of it. The ability to spot <small>ICBM</small> sites from space was so precious that it was worth risking the White House to keep it secret.</p><p>What was then world-historic is now the stuff of student projects—albeit an exceptional project for an exceptional student. When rumours of new Chinese <small>ICBM</small> launch sites fluttered through Washington, <small>DC</small>, earlier this year, Decker Eveleth applied himself to the problem. His resources were easily sourced satellite pictures; common sense, which told him the silos would be on flat land far from American radars in Japan and South Korea; and a degree of stick-with-it-ness sufficient to the challenge of systematically examining all the empty plains of western China.</p><p>Having slogged all across Inner Mongolia without luck, he hit gold in neighbouring Gansu. There, in the Gobi desert, he could see 120 missile silos under construction, the largest such effort mounted anywhere on Earth since the end of the cold war. A month later Matt Korda, a 26-year-old researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, an <small>NGO</small>, discovered the same telltale grid pattern in a secluded part of Xinjiang.</p><p>Mr Eveleth first dabbled in the interpretation of satellite data two years ago, when he was a sophomore in college. “A class had some very boring readings,” he says, “so I opened Google Earth.” That led him to Geo4Nonpro, a crowdsourced project which let budding hobbyists and seasoned experts collaborate to annotate satellite pictures of everything from uranium mines in India to chemical-weapon facilities in Syria. “It’s fun,” says Mr Eveleth. “There’s a happy feeling you get when you look at a site and think: I’m the first person to know what that is.”</p><p>Geo4Nonpro was run by the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies (<small>CNS</small>), a part of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, California. The <small>CNS</small> is a leader in gathering and analysing open-source intelligence (<small>OSINT</small>). It has pulled off some dramatic coups with satellite pictures, including on one occasion actually catching the launch of a North Korean missile in an image (pictured above) provided by Planet, a company in San Francisco.</p><p>Satellite data, though, is only one of the resources feeding a veritable boom in non-state <small>OSINT</small>. There are websites which track all sorts of useful goings-on, including the routes taken by aircraft and ships. There are vast searchable databases. Terabytes of footage from phones are uploaded to social-media sites every day, much of it handily tagged. “On their phone people have the same quality information I used to have to go into a secure facility for,” says Bruce Klingner, who worked as an analyst for the <small>CIA</small> and the Pentagon’s Defence Intelligence Agency for 20 years. “It&#39;s just really kind of mind-boggling.”</p><p>And it is not just the data. There are also tools and techniques for working with them—3<small>D</small> modelling packages, for example, which let you work out what sort of object might be throwing the shadow you see in a picture. And there are social media and institutional settings that let this be done collaboratively. Eclectic expertise and experience can easily be leveraged with less-well-versed enthusiasm and curiosity in the service of projects which link academics, activists, journalists and people who mix the attributes of all three groups. The intelligence world is thus being democratised, a development which is challenging governments, reshaping diplomacy and chipping away at the very idea of secrecy.</p><h2>An archaeology of knowledge</h2><p>When Eliot Higgins began analysing YouTube footage of weapons used in the Syrian civil war in the early 2010s it was seen as a “weird amateur hobby”, he says. But he saw their potential. In 2014 Mr Higgins founded Bellingcat, a collective of researchers, investigators and “citizen-journalists” funded by a range of charities which now has 18 full-time employees. In its first year it cut its teeth on an investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines flight, <small>MH</small>17, over eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Local people had posted videos of a Russian missile launcher moving through the area. Mr Higgins and a band of volunteers roamed Google Earth to identify various trees, road bends and buildings visible in those videos so that they could say exactly where it had been when. <a href="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6a3f01180b03040f2a1d0b18">[email protected]</a>, an anonymous blogger, identified a specific field as the likely launch site. Photographs taken later showed the same launcher back in Russia—and missing one missile.</p><p>When a Ukraine International Airlines flight, <small>PS</small>752, crashed outside Tehran on January 8th 2020, five days after America had assassinated a leading Iranian general, Bellingcat was on the case again. So were the members of a channel on Slack, an instant-messaging and collaboration tool, called “Arms Control Wonk Podcast”: the podcast in question was founded by Jeffrey Lewis of <small>CNS</small>. The channel’s 1,000-strong membership bats around thoughts on everything from missile tests to the spread of covid-19, says Paddy Kerley, an Irish cyber-security professional who enjoys scrutinising North Korean nuclear facilities in his spare time. Others have equally esoteric interests. “There’s one guy reverse engineering a Sidewinder [missile] that he bought parts of on eBay—you know, normal things normal people do.” Membership costs $5 a month, $3 for students.</p><p>Photographs taken at the <small>PS</small>752 crash site showed the mangled parts of a rocket and damage that seemed consistent with a missile attack. Wary of misinformation, the Bellingcat team ran a search for previous uses of the same images. It came up blank, suggesting the photos were new.</p><p>A video posted anonymously to Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, showed a light streaking into the sky, a flash and a boom just prior to the crash. A series of nondescript apartment blocks and a construction site were visible in the foreground. The Slack team divided into groups to pan through freely available satellite images of Tehran looking for the same pattern. They lighted on a spot in a suburb to the west of Imam Khomeini International Airport (see illustration).</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1868/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210807_fbm933.png"/><p></p></div></figure><p>Locating that spot gave the analysts a bearing. The 11 seconds between the flash in the sky and the sound of the explosion provided a distance. According to FlightRadar24, a website which displays the transponder signals of aircraft, the location thus calculated sat on the flight path of <small>PS</small>752. It had been downed by a surface-to-air missile launched from nearby.</p><p>The next day Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that “intelligence from multiple sources” showed that the plane had been brought down by Iran&#39;s own air defences. Such accusations were “psychological warfare against Iran”, thundered an Iranian spokesman. But the evidence of what had actually happened continued to accumulate, thanks both to government briefings (the sorry chain of events had been captured by American spy satellites; the mobile-phone conversations of panicked revolutionary guards had been intercepted) and to the people using <small>OSINT</small> techniques. On January 11th Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, publicly acknowledged that a “disastrous mistake” had been made.</p><p>As in the case of <small>MH</small>17, the <small>OSINT</small> efforts were not the last word. But on both occasions the open availability of evidence gathered from diverse sources and analysed independently was incriminating in a way that <em>parti-pris</em> pronouncements from intelligence agencies would not have been on their own.</p><h2>The order of things</h2><p>In reacting to events such as the downing of aircraft, the <small>OSINT</small> community typically relies on data that are already out there. For other projects it acquires new data it expects to have use for—often from space. The capabilities that <small>CORONA</small> provided in the 1960s are now handily outstripped by a bevy of commercial satellite operators (see chart). Planet has been launching cameras on tiny “cubesats” since 2013 and now has a constellation of about 150 with which it aims to photograph all of the Earth’s land surface every day. Its cheaper images have a resolution of three metres per pixel, picking out objects the size of a car; its sharper ones are 50cm per pixel, showing more detail. Companies like Maxar, a maker of bigger American satellites, and Airbus, a European aerospace giant, provide higher-resolution images.</p><div><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210807_FBC149.png"/><p></p></div></figure><p>When, in the 1990s, the American government sought to encourage the development of such ventures, it imagined controls over the high-resolution stuff. That policy foundered when companies elsewhere began to sell high-resolution images on the open market; better that American companies be able to compete than that they go under. Though “shutter control” by the American government remains possible, the law it rests on is not used. Subtler suasion may be at play, though. Dr Lewis has the impression that some at the Pentagon have been less than pleased with some of the images published by his team; when the government is a big customer, such anger could matter to the revenue of the companies involved.</p><p>The government is a big customer because the commercial images provide a useful supplement to its classified in-house capabilities. They also provide a rhetorical resource: pictures bought commercially can be used publicly without revealing anything about classified capabilities. “We are providing a particular role in society that most open countries, including the United States, net benefit from,” says Will Marshall, the <small>CEO</small> of Planet. “It might occasionally expose something inconvenient for them, but that’s the new state of the world.”</p></div><h2>You can look</h2><p>If government is the biggest consumer, though, Dr Lewis may be the keenest. He and his colleagues have used data from Planet, Maxar, Airbus and others to analyse missile programmes in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. The evidence base they have built to further their work on non-proliferation has earned them an impressive reputation for unearthing missile launchers, rocket factories and nuclear plants.</p><p>“Overhead” imagery, as it is known, is not magic; it needs interpretation, and that means knowing what you are looking for. A haunting lesson comes from a second-world-war reconnaissance mission. In 1944 a plane sent to photograph a chemicals plant in northern Poland which the allies planned to bomb turned its cameras on early and captured images of a large industrial complex nearby. It was only three decades later that Dino Brugioni and Robert Poirier, a pair of <small>CIA</small> analysts working in their spare time, pointed out that those early frames were the first aerial images ever taken of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps.</p><p>Further flights took pictures of the roof vents where Zyklon-B crystals were inserted into the gas chambers; of long, snaking lines of prisoners; of smoke billowing from the pits behind Birkenau’s crematorium. None were recognised for what they were. “There simply was no historical or intelligence precedence [sic] for genocide on such a scale,” wrote Mr Brugioni in an essay in 1983. “Most World War II interpreters I have spoken to found the concept unbelievable, unimaginable, and completely incongruous.” Other intelligence officers had more sense of what was going on; but they did not know about the photos, and the interpreters did not know to ask them.</p><p>Today’s <small>OSINT</small> community does not suffer from such compartmentalisation, and it has sources on the ground from which it can learn more about structures seen from the sky. In 2017 reports of “counter-extremism” and “political education” camps built by China to detain Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, a western province, began circulating in local and foreign media outlets. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (<small>ASPI</small>), a think-tank, gathered this evidence in a single database, supplemented it with photographs shared on Chinese social media and started looking at satellite images for structures which fitted the bill. They identified 28.</p><p>China unwittingly made adding to the tally easy. In August 2018 journalists at <em>BuzzFeed News</em> noticed that Baidu Maps, a Chinese app, was systematically blotting out some places in Xinjiang. A number of the blots covered camps found by <small>ASPI</small>. Searching Baidu Maps for the easy-to-see blots and then looking at uncensored satellite data of the same spots revealed a gulag archipelago of several hundred more camps, most of them previously unknown.</p><p>Had China built such a machinery of repression three decades ago, stories from inmates and their relatives would doubtless have trickled out. America would have seen the facilities involved with its spy satellites, had it looked, and might have vouched for their existence. But the digital record furnishes evidence that is publicly accessible and visually compelling; nothing has done more to make the oppression of the Uyghurs international news.</p><p>Ever better hardware for phones, a technological trend which can be relied on, means ever better hardware for satellites. Planet’s cubesats are now far more capable than those it launched in 2013. Other companies are pioneering new forms of satellite observation. Capella, Ice-Eye, Umbra and Xpress-<small>SAR</small> are radar-satellite startups offering “synthetic aperture” technology which can take detailed pictures of surface features even through clouds, foliage and, sometimes, thin roofs. (It can also provide entirely unexpected insights. In 2018 Harel Dan, an analyst at a company in Israel, showed that the powerful radars used by American Patriot missile batteries interfered with the operations of a European radar satellite, Sentinel-1, thereby revealing hitherto unknown air-defence sites.)</p><p>Hyperspectral sensors, capable of making fine distinctions in the analysis of light beyond the visible blue, green and red bands, reveal things as diverse as wakes in turbid water, the health of crops or the difference between new and old paintwork. They may also show things which, wavelength-restricted as their own eyes are, human interpreters have yet to imagine. It is in part to guard against missing such things that satellite images are increasingly fed into machine-learning software which will see patterns humans might not pick out, or even think to look for.</p><p>This is not all being done for the benefit of spooks and their civilian <small>OSINT</small> counterparts. Seeing the world in detail and watching it change over time has all sorts of applications for agriculture, for investors, for commodity companies, for environmental monitoring of corporate activities and more. But <small>OSINT</small> is a happy fellow traveller.</p><h2>But you better not touch</h2><p>The infovorous energy and ecumenical spirit of online <small>OSINT</small> are not unprecedented. The men and women who staffed the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, America’s wartime proto-<small>OSINT</small> organisation, were “the greatest collection of individualists, international rolling stones, and slightly batty geniuses ever gathered together in one organisation”, remarked a journalist who visited their Washington office in 1943, a “unique combination of newspapermen and <small>P</small>h<small>D</small>s” consumed by “casual kidding in 17 foreign languages [and] the feeling that something big may come over at any minute”.</p><p>The same buzz is now replicated in online chats and Slack channels. To locate a tent from a scrap of road marker glimpsed through a gap in the canvas wins kudos. What other high jinks can compare with using Denis Rodman, a basketball player, to measure the size of an <small>H</small>-bomb? Photographs of Mr Rodman standing with Kim Jong Un allow a reliable estimate of the North Korean dictator’s height (it would be foolish to trust official statistics on such a matter). From Mr Kim’s height you can estimate the size of his head; from that you can get the size of nuclear weapons with which he has posed.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210807_fbp510.jpg"/><p></p></div><figcaption>Mr Kim and his bomb (Dennis Rodman included for scale)</figcaption></figure><p>The techniques of <small>OSINT</small> are not only applicable in closed states and war zones. In 1978 William Arkin, who had until recently been an intelligence analyst tracking Soviet nuclear forces in East Germany for the American army, tried to work out where their <small>NATO</small> equivalents in the West were. He found what seemed to be telltale terms used in unclassified descriptions of some military units and found the addresses of the bases they were stationed at. In the antediluvian days before Google Earth he travelled round Germany looking at the sites thus identified. They turned out all to have a distinct double-fence security set-up and identical guard towers, measures which confirmed the presence of something particularly dangerous and worth protecting.</p><p>When Mr Arkin’s findings were published in 1981 America accused him of having used classified information from his army days. To avoid criminal charges he had to prove the information was all in the public domain. In a new book, “Restricted Data”, Alex Wellerstein, a historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology, describes the proceedings: “A colonel shouted the names of bases, and Arkin would then display the tangled web of documents proving that each base contained nuclear weapons.” As they ran through base after base, the colonel “slumped deeper and deeper into his seat”. Mr Arkin walked free.</p><p>Some may sympathise with the colonel. If <small>OSINT</small> makes keeping military secrets harder it may give comfort to enemies. “We often get complaints from professional photo interpreters, that they don’t like seeing their method described so explicitly in public”, says Dr Lewis, “because they think it might help the adversary.”</p><p>Many of his colleagues are acutely aware of these risks. Melissa Hanham of Stanford University says that when her <small>OSINT</small> work led her to a theory of why North Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles were failing she decided that it would be wrong to publish it, lest it help the missileers. She is working with various <small>OSINT</small> organisations to develop a code of conduct for open-source researchers faced with such ethical quandaries.</p><p>The room for improvement that can be revealed by <small>OSINT</small> is not just in dictatorships. In early 2018 Nathan Ruser, then a student and now an analyst at <small>ASPI</small>, got interested in the data made publicly available by Strava, an app that allows users to log exercise routines. It showed joggers looping around New York’s Central Park, cyclists streaming down Shanghai’s Bund and swimmers thronging Bondi Beach. It also showed lonelier fitness regimes being pursued in various hotspots around the world, thus revealing what turned out to be <small>CIA</small> bases in Somalia and Djibouti and a Patriot missile battery in Yemen. Was this embarrassing? Yes. Is it likely to lead to better security in future? Again, yes.</p><p>If security services can benefit from <small>OSINT</small>, can they also use it to their own ends? When Bellingcat identified the two Russian agents who had poisoned Sergei Skripal, a Russian spy living in the English city of Salisbury, the Kremlin was apoplectic. “Bellingcat is closely connected with the intelligence services,” fumed Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, “which uses it to channel information intended to influence public opinion.”</p><p>If such accusations were to stick, the organisation would be weakened. It is to give the lie to them that Bellingcat meticulously documents the databases it draws on, the methods it uses and the crosschecks by which it validates things. To plant a falsehood that passed muster would mean starting a paper trail years before: not impossible, but hard to do on the fly. And hard to get away with, too, in an open community full of frenemies eager to probe each other’s conclusions.</p><h2>Why didn’t you tell the world?</h2><p>The most general challenge posed by <small>OSINT</small> is the weakening of a certain sort of state power. Dr Wellerstein argues that treating secrecy as simply denying people information misses something crucial. “It&#39;s about the control of the information. It&#39;s about the ability to dole it out as you see fit to get your ends…and governments have always known this.” Dr Lewis was originally attracted to <small>OSINT</small> in the early 2000s by his frustration during the run-up to the Iraq war. He felt that civil society had no way to check dubious claims being made on the basis of intelligence released through choreographed public statements and secret briefings to news organisations. Now, to an increasing extent, it does.</p><p>In undermining state monopolies on intelligence, <small>OSINT</small> is increasingly capable of challenging the narratives states promulgate. The <small>CNS</small> and other <small>OSINT</small> groups, for example, have consistently provided a sense of North Korea’s nuclear abilities more realistic than that offered by recent American administrations, which repeatedly claimed they would not allow North Korea to develop capabilities which, judging by the <small>OSINT</small> evidence, it already had.</p><p>If revealing inconvenient truths undermines policies based on ignoring the facts, though, it is not necessarily a road to peace. A country given a bloody nose in a border skirmish might be less inclined to back down if its citizens are shown evidence of its failure. Secrecy enables face-saving, and thus de-escalation.</p><p>Consider the resolution of the Cuba crisis in 1962. The removal of Soviet nuclear weapons from the island was achieved through a deal which also saw America remove its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. This quid pro quo was kept secret for decades; Kennedy even lied about it to former presidents. “Any other course”, his aides later wrote, “would have had explosive and destructive effects on the security of the United States and its allies.” Secrecy enables malfeasance, perhaps, but it can also serve as a lubricant. In an age of <small>OSINT</small> the withdrawal of the Jupiters would quickly have become common knowledge.</p><p>But would the quid pro quo have been necessary at all in such an age? Cuba was a crisis because the missiles were already there when America first became aware of the situation. Today, one imagines, it would have been on the ball a lot earlier. And if, for some reason, it had missed what was under its nose, driven, chatty and motivated satellite-data wonks would have delighted in telling the government, the press or Twitter what was what. A reduced capacity for subterfuge may, in some cases, be a genuine loss. A lessened risk of strategic surprise is a real benefit. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline &#34;Trainspotting, with nukes&#34;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>Any museum can get a telescope and point it to the stars, but few can bring the wonders of the galaxy down to Earth. The new Shanghai Astronomy Museum, which recently opened in China, is potentially the world’s most majestic museum devoted to the skies. This elliptical, silvery structure looks part spaceship, part planetary invasion, with angular shapes that “embody some of the fundamental laws of astrophysics,” says the museum’s designer, Thomas J. Wong, a design partner at <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.ennead.com/work/shanghai-astronomy-museum&#34;}" href="http://www.ennead.com/work/shanghai-astronomy-museum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ennead Architects</a>.</p><p>The largest museum devoted to the art of astronomy, this 420,000-square-foot masterpiece is a new branch of the <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.sstm.org.cn/&#34;}" href="http://www.sstm.org.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shanghai Science and Technology Museum</a>, which has landed upon a green swath of land alongside the nearby Maritime Museum and a new astronomy-themed public park, which will soon be completed.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>Measuring some 420,000 square feet, this is the world’s largest museum devoted to astronomy.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>That sci-fi wow factor was no accident. “The big idea was to infuse a visceral experience of astronomy into the design and deliver that before you even enter the building,” Wong says. “The building itself is conceived as an ‘astronomical instrument’ that coordinates with the path of the Sun across a day, and the changing solar altitude in our sky through the seasons.”</p><p>Ennead won the 2014 design competition to create the Astronomy Museum as a building that echoes the geometry of the universe. They previously designed the rotund, planetary-like <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/rose-center&#34;}" href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/rose-center" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rose Center for Earth and Space</a> at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In Shanghai, one of the museum’s main highlights includes the Oculus. Suspended above the main entrance, this round design detail tracks time by sunlight throughout the day, calling back to 14th century sundials.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>A view inside of the brand-new museum, located in Shanghai.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>“At noon, the figure of light is most complete during any single day,” Wong says. “When the Sun is highest in the sky during summer solstice, a full and pure circle of light aligns with an inscribed circle on the plaza’s pavement.”</p><p>Science and the stars were the inspiration for the design, which focuses on the most crucial of all orbital movements, explains Wong: “The daily rotation of our Earth and its journey around our star.”</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>A look at one of the many exhibitions inside the museum.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another one of the museum’s highlights is the Sphere, which looks like an enormous planet that has dropped into the core of the museum. It almost touches the ground (but not quite). This silver metallic sphere, punctured with circles, is home to a planetarium theater that tracks the Sun, Moon, and the stars. Its overwhelming size ties into Wong’s favorite Carl Sagan quote: “Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.”</p><p>The last and final feature along museumgoers’ way is the Inverted Dome, which is high up on the museum’s rooftop. The roof allows an unfettered view of the sky, with glass panels that look downward into the museum, offering a pause between the macro and the micro.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>With ample space, the museum allows for stunningly lifelike exhibition experiences.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all, Wong wanted to take us elsewhere, beyond the beyond. “We wanted to highlight actual astronomical phenomena that have occurred here on Earth—things that have become more removed from our consciousness, particularly in modern urban life,” he says.</p><p>They also wanted to avoid predictable, clean lines. “We wanted the architecture to reflect the essence of the universe,” Wong says. “There are no straight lines or right angles in space.”</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The relentlessness of chronic pain wears you down. Beyond being a physical distraction in and of itself, it disrupts sleep, <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/when-someone-on-your-team-has-chronic-pain">interferes with work</a> and relationships, and can even alter the way we process emotions by causing <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-pain-disrupts-our-emotions-right-down-on-a-chemical-level">physiological changes in our brains</a>.</p>
<p>But the experience of long-term pain is complicated and varies between individuals, making it difficult to explain and quantify, let alone diagnose and manage.</p><p>Now, in a large study of over 21,500 people who visited the University of Pittsburgh&#39;s severe pain management clinics, perioperative specialist Benedict Alter and colleagues have developed a new method to try to help work this out.</p><p>&#34;We found that how a patient reports the bodily distribution of their chronic pain affects nearly all aspects of the pain experience, including what happens three months later,&#34; the team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">wrote in their paper</a>.</p><p>Using a computer clustering analysis of patient body pain maps and pain assessments, the researchers discovered that patients fit into nine groups of chronic pain, as defined in the image below.</p><p>What&#39;s more, these patterns of pain distribution could predict pain intensity, pain quality, pain impact, physical function, mood, sleep and indicate likely patient outcomes.</p><p><span><span>(Alter et al., PLOS One, 2021)</span></span></p><p><em>Above: B<span>ody pain maps for each of the nine identified chronic pain clusters, with colored heat scale indicating frequency of pain.</span></em></p><p>For example, while the group of patients experiencing lower back pain radiating below the knee (group F) had worse physical function difficulties than those experiencing neck and shoulder pain (E) or neck, shoulder and lower back pain (G), these patients reported less anxiety, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" target="_blank" title="depression">depression</a>, and sleep disturbance than the other two groups.</p><p>A subset of over 7,000 patients completed a follow-up questionnaire, three months after filling out the initial body pain map and questionnaire. Patients experiencing abdominal pain (group B) showed the most progress, with almost half reporting significant improvement.</p><p>Those with neck, shoulder and lower back pain (group G), however, demonstrated the worst outcomes on follow-up, with only 37 percent reporting improvements. This group shared characteristics with the two widespread pain groups, causing the team to ponder if this subgroup may be an early stage in developing generalized, widespread chronic pain. The researchers recommend a long term study to monitor pain duration and stability over time within this group.</p><p>What&#39;s more, their findings that the more widespread the pain, the more persistent it is, are consistent with a<a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recent MRI study</a> in fibromyalgia patients that found the more widespread reported pain is on body maps, the more changes observed in brain connectivity around the pain-processing parts of the brain.</p><p>&#34;A case can be made that reports of widespread pain collected with digital pain body maps are diagnostic of pathophysiological changes in pain processing,&#34; Alter and team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">suggest</a>.</p><p>This ability for body pain maps to indicate likely patient outcomes could help identify patients at risk of poor outcomes even from their first pain clinic visit.</p><p><span><span>(Alter et al., PLOS One, 2021)</span></span></p><p><em>Above: </em><i>each row on the vertical axis represents an individual patient out of the entire cohort (N = 21,658 unique patients) organized by pain body map cluster membership.</i></p><p>With up to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15585%2Fmmwr.mm6736a2">40 percent of adults</a> in the US currently experiencing chronic pain - which is likely to increase with the potential <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001950">impacts of long term COVID-19</a> - diagnostic tools such as this could make a massive difference in many people&#39;s lives.</p><p>There&#39;s still a lot of work to do to untangle all these relationships, and the researchers caution that this is an observational study so they cannot establish causation.</p><p>&#34;Outcome data do not address specific therapies, and therefore, it remains unclear which specific treatment may be helpful for a particular body map cluster,&#34; they <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/large-body-map-study-suggests-chronic-pain-comes-in-9-distinct-types?nc">wrote</a>.</p><p>However, Alter and team believe their study supports the idea that chronic pain is a disease process and these aspects of how its physical distribution manifests <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/923834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be</a> &#34;important for future developments in diagnosis and personalized pain management&#34;.</p><p>This research was published in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">PLOS One</a></em>.</p> </div>

on the world’s biggest emitters to ramp up efforts at decarbonising the global economy at the UN’s <a

to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and push for efforts to hold it to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Amid mounting pressure from allies across Europe and the US to commit to net zero by 2050, the Morrison government is expected to seize on the IPCC’s findings as a call for more immediate action using technologies such as carbon capture, “blue” hydrogen and energy

come after an <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/labor-selectively-opposed-to-new-attempt-to-broaden-arena-s-remit-20210802-p58eyt">attempt failed late on Wednesday by Labor</a> to block

widely predict that once annual average global temperatures rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, the world will see a surge in climactic tipping points, resulting in larger and more volatile heatwaves, rising sea levels, melting ice, and droughts that will threaten food supplies and economies around the world.</p><p>The world is now estimated to be around two-thirds of the way towards reaching the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.</p><p>According to the World Meteorological Organisation, the average temperature will be at least 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels over each of the next five years, with a range of between 0.9 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Despite the efforts of many developed countries, global greenhouse emissions have risen more than 45 per cent between 2000 and 2019, with the Paris Agreement allowing most developing countries to continue increasing emissions until 2030.</p><p>Experts and Western leaders warn that keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold alive means pushing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil to reduce emissions before the end of this decade, a massive challenge that could ultimately derail the Glasgow talks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Feelings at the Fall of the Republic, Ancient and Medieval Living Standards</title>
      <link>https://acoup.blog/2021/08/06/referenda-ad-senatum-august-6-2021-feelings-at-the-fall-of-the-republic-ancient-and-medieval-living-standards-and-zombies/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Welcome!  This is going to be the first of a new sort of post we’ll do from time to time where I answer a number of shorter questions posed by my patrons over at Patreon who are at the <em>Patres et Matres Conscripti</em> tier, which entitles them to a seat in the <em>ACOUP</em> Senate (which is apparently more like the imperial senate, given that it has a strict wealth requirement).  Questions that get posed for these posts which end up being too long and complex will go back to the <em>ACOUP</em> Senate for a vote to determine which topics get full posts dedicated to them.</p>



<p>As for the title of this post type, in Latin the phrase <em>referre ad senatum</em> (‘to refer to the Senate’) meant that a magistrate would convene the senate and pose a question for debate (the final decision of the Senate in such debates, expressed as an up-or-down vote on a proposal, was called a <em>senatus consultum</em> or ‘the advice of the Senate;’ such advice was, in the Republic, non-binding – it was <em>not</em> a law – but nearly always followed).  So these posts are <em>Referenda ad senatum</em>, ‘things which must be referred to the Senate’ (Latin can be a wonderfully compact language sometimes).</p>



<p>I do want to note at the outset that the answers to these questions aren’t quite the same as a planned and researched blog post; these are mostly off-the-cuff responses and should be taken as such.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux">@BretDevereaux</a>) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<figure><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate#/media/File:Cicer%C3%B3n_denuncia_a_Catilina,_por_Cesare_Maccari.jpg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate#/media/File:Cicer%C3%B3n_denuncia_a_Catilina,_por_Cesare_Maccari.jpg">Via Wikipedia</a>, Cicero Denounces Catiline, by Cesare Maccari.  This isn’t an accurate layout of the Roman curia Hostilia (the Senate house where the speech in question would have been delivered), which was rectangular in form and would have been a lot more cramped than this.  Nevertheless, as it is probably the most famous depiction of the Roman Senate, it seemed a worthwhile title card.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Q: Vitali asks: <strong>How did the Romans feel about the crumbling of the Republic and the emergence of the Empire?  Did people in the provinces notice?  What about people in Rome?</strong></p>



<p>A: Note of course that we are talking about the collapse of the <em>republic</em> (so the first century BC) not the collapse of the <em>empire</em> (in the fifth eentury AD).</p>



<p>The Romans themselves had a lot of thoughts about the collapse of the republic.  First, we should note that they were <em>aware</em> that something was going very wrong and we have a fair bit of evidence that at least some Romans were trying to figure out how to fix it.  Sulla’s reforms (enforced at the point of a much-used sword) in 82-80 BC were an effort to fix what he saw as the progressive destabilization of the the republic going back to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus (133).  Sulla’s solutions were hamfisted though – he assumed that if he annihilated the opposing faction, crippled the tribunate and strengthened the Senate that this would resolve all of the problems.  Cicero likewise considered reforms during the 50s BCE which come out in his <em>De re publica</em> and <em>De legibus.</em>  The 50s were a time of political turmult in Rome while at the same time the last years of the decade must have been loomed over by the knowledge of an impending crisis to come in 49.  Cicero was never in a position to enact his idealized republic.</p>



<p>Overall the various Romans who contemplated reform were in a way hindered by the tendency of Roman elites to think in terms of the virtue of individuals rather than the tendency of systems.  You can see this very clearly in the writings of Sallust – another Roman writing with considerable concern as the republic comes apart – who places the fault on the collapse of Roman morals rather than on any systemic problem.</p>



<p>We also get a sense of these feelings from the literature that emerges after Augustus takes power in 31, and here there is a lot of complexity.  There is quite a lot of praise for Augustus of course – it would have been <em>profoundly</em> unwise to do otherwise – but also quite a lot of deep discomfort with the recent past, revealed in places like Livy’s deeply morally compromised legends of the founding of Rome or the sharp moral ambiguity in the final books of Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em>.  On the other hand, some of the praise for Augustus seems to have been genuine.  There was clearly an awful lot of <em>exhaustion</em> after so many years of disruption and civil war and so a general openness to Augustus’ ‘restored republic.’   Still, some Romans were clearly bothered by the collapse of the republic even much later; Lucan’s <em>Pharsalia</em> (65 AD) casts Pompey and Cato as heroes and views Caesar far more grimly.</p>



<p>We have less evidence for feeling in the provinces, but of course for many provincials, little would have changed.  Few of Augustus’ changes would have done much to change  much for people living in the provinces, whose taxes, laws and lives remained the same.  They were clearly aware of what was going on and among the elite there was clearly a scramble to try to get on the right side of whoever was going to win; being on the <em>wrong</em> side of the eventual winner could be a very dangerous place to be.  But for most regular provincials, the collapse of the Roman Republic only mattered if some rogue Roman general’s army happened to march through their part of the world.</p>



<p>Q: Dillon asks: <strong>How did living standards and technology compare between Rome and later medieval Europe?</strong></p>



<p>A: This is a frequent question and obviously a full response would require several books to write, but I think I can briefly chart some outlines of what an answer would look like.</p>



<p>The first crucial question here is exactly when in the Middle Ages one means.  There is a tendency to essentialize the European Middle Ages, often suggesting that the <em>entire</em> period reflected a regression from antiquity, but the medieval period is very long, stretching about a thousand years (c. 500 to c. 1500 AD).  There is also the question of <em>where</em> one means; the trajectory of the eastern Mediterranean is much different than the western Mediterranean.  I am going to assume we really mean western Europe.</p>



<p>While I am convinced that the evidence suggests there <em>was</em> a drop in living standards and some loss of technology in the <em>immediate </em>aftermath of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, most of that drop was fairly short-lived.  But exactly when development in medieval Europe meets and then exceeds the same for antiquity (typically we’re comparing the second century height of the Roman Empire) also depends on exactly what <em>kind</em> of measure is being used.</p>



<p>If the question, for instance, is agricultural productivity on a <em>per capita</em> basis (the most important component of per capita economic production), medieval Europe probably moves ahead of the Roman Empire fairly quickly with the introduction of better types of plow and widespread use of watermills for grinding grain.  My understanding is that by c. 1000AD, watermills show up fairly frequently in things like monastic charters, suggesting they were reasonably widespread (the Romans used watermills too, though their spread was uneven) and by that point, plow technology had also moved forward, mostly through the development of plow types better suited to Europe’s climate.  So as best we can tell, the farmer of c. 1000 AD had better tools than his Roman predecessors and probably had such for some time.</p>



<p>If the question is technology and engineering, once again what you see depends on where you look.  Some technologies don’t appear to have regressed much, if at all, ironworking being one example where it seems like little to nothing was lost.  On the other hand, in <em>western</em> Europe, the retreat in architecture is really marked and it is hard to say when you would judge the new innovations (like flying buttresses) to have equaled some of the lost ones (like concrete); certainly the great 12th/13th century Cathedrals (e.g. Notre Dame, the Duomo di Sienna and I <em>suppose</em> the lesser Duomo di Firenze, if we must include it) seem to me to have matched or exceeded all but perhaps the biggest Roman architectural projects.  Though we have to pause here because in many cases the issue was less architectural know-how (though that was a factor) as state capacity: the smaller and more fragmented states of the European Middle Ages didn’t have the resources the Roman Empire did.</p>



<p>If one instead looks for urbanization and population as the measure of development, the Middle Ages looks rather worse.  First and Second century Rome is probably unmatched in Europe until the very late 1700s, early 1800s, when first London (c. 1800) and Paris (c. 1835) reach a million.  So one looking for matches for the large cities and magnificent municipal infrastructure of the Romans will have rather a long wait.  Overall population is much more favorable as a measurement to the Middle Ages.  France probably exceeds its highest Roman population (c. 9m) by or shortly after 1000AD, Italy (c. 7.5m) by probably 1200; Spain is the odd one out, with Roman Hispania (est. 7.5m) probably only matched in the early modern period.  So for most of the Middle Ages you are looking at a larger population, but also a more rural one.  That’s not necessarily bad though; pre-modern cities were hazardous places due to sanitation and disease; such cities had a markedly higher mortality, for instance.  On the flip-side, fewer, smaller cities means less economic specialization.</p>



<p>So one’s answer often depends very much on what one values most.  For my own part, I’d say by 1000 or 1100 we can very safely say the ‘recovery’ phase of the Middle Ages is clearly over (and I think you could make an argument for setting this point substantially earlier but not meaningfully later), though even this is somewhat deceptive because it implies that no new technological ground was being broken before then, which is not true.  But the popular conception that the <em>whole</em> of the Middle Ages reflects a retreat from the standards of antiquity is to be discarded.</p>



<p>Q: Casey Larkin asks: <strong>When did you know that you wanted to study history as a career?  Was there a specific event or have you always been interested in it?</strong></p>



<p>A: History has always been something I’ve been interested in.  I am one of those rare creatures who entered college majored in exactly the degree I walked out of the door with.  The only major question I had was what sort of history I wanted to study, though the draw to Rome was always very strong (I had taken Latin in high school).  When I was very young I was mostly drawn to the flashy parts of history – battles, kings, etc.  As I got into college, I found myself drawn into what I’d describe as ‘imperial dynamics’ – investigating the extremely complex structures of very large states and the ways those structures shaped the lives of people who lived in those states (often for the worse).  I took a wide range of coursework trying to figure out exactly which mega-state I wanted to specialize in, but Rome spoke to me the most.</p>



<p>In particular, from that question, Rome suggested itself because it is far more often held up as a model of ‘success’ on those terms – in expansion, encouraging provincial buy-in, improving quality of life, etc.  The actual Rome doesn’t quite live up to that rose-tinted hype (it was, after all, an exploitative tributary empire), but it comes a lot closer than most historical empires.  It is, after all, very rare for an empire to <em>fall</em> and then have its former exploited subjects spend the better part of a millennia at least trying to reinvent it.  That said, that very process of trying to mobilize the memory of Rome in support of new imperial projects is part of what leads to the excessively rosey reputation Rome enjoys.</p>



<p>I should note I do have a post planned discussing what graduate school and getting a Ph.D in history is like, so I won’t steal my own thunder there.  I will say that, while I’ve always been interested in history, actually delving into the work of history itself has changed around my interests a fair bit.  Often it seems to me many history ‘buffs’ want to relive or <em>experience</em> history and certainly as a kid that was me, but at some point that impulse only gets one so far (because, after all, you can’t <em>actually</em> relive a historical moment) and one begins to seek to <em>understand</em> history rather than experience it vicariously.  That shift fundamentally changes the kinds of questions you ask and the evidence you look at.</p>



<p>Q: Adam Haun asks: <strong>Zombie Apocalypse!  How would ‘zombie tactics’ work against a <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/" data-type="post" data-id="2600">modern-system</a> army with NBC (Nuclear, biological, chemical protection) suits.  What about logistics issues?</strong></p>



<p>A: This is in a way a bit of a trick question.  The core components of the <em>modern system</em> – cover and concealment, maneuver offensives, and the acceleration of operational tempo beyond the opponent’s ability to adapt – none of these are really applicable to a war against mostly unthinking enemies who employ only melee combat and don’t have morale or coordination to speak of.  So a lot of the operational art behind the modern system wouldn’t be applicable.  But the <em>tools</em> and <em>training</em> developed to make the modern system work, it seems to me, probably would.  The whole reason the modern system emerged was because it became clear that no amount of concentration or <em>élan</em> could actually achieve offensive breakthrough against modern firepower.</p>



<p>That said, first we need to concede that it is certainly possible to craft a fictional zombie apocalypse so severe that this doesn’t matter.  If your zombie apocalypse is the result of an airborne pathogen which is lethal in 99.99% of cases well then nothing much here is going to matter.  But at that point, I should also note that the <em>zombies</em> are entirely incidental to the pathogen in terms of causing destruction.  So here I am going to assume the classic forms of zombie transmission: either by bite or by the dead reanimating on death.  If that’s the transmission method, I am actually very confident in a modern military’s ability to contain a zombie outbreak.</p>



<p>First, we want to dispense with ‘the soldiers fire uselessly, not realizing they need to hit the zombies in the head’ issue.  Modern rifle bullets move very fast and deliver lots of energy; they do not punch a neat hole in a target, but instead create a brief, much larger cavity produced by the transfer of kinetic energy, which stretches and damages tissue around the point of impact.  While zombies may lack vital organs and might not be able to bleed out, they do rely on the basic physics of muscles and bones in order to move.  I suspect the world’s armies would discover fairly rapidly where they needed to shot to actually disable a zombie target, but in the meantime, concentrated rifle fire is likely to work on isolated zombies, particularly since zombies cannot regenerate damages tissue.  It does no matter that zombies feel no pain: if their leg or arm is shot off, or their spine shattered, or their muscle-tissue is reduced to goo, being able to move is a question of physics, not determination.  Moreover, because these bullets are moving fast with a lot of energy, striking an unarmored human target (that is, a zombie) is not going to stop them; clustering lots of zombies up will mean bullets or bullet-fragments exiting the first zombie and striking the next.  And the next.  Barbed wire would also be effective; we’ll actually talk about this in a few weeks, but a zombie whose clothing or skin is caught on the wire would be every bit as stuck as a human, giving abundant time to be shot, stabbed, etc.</p>



<p>For large groups of zombies, I think the issue here is that Hollywood and popular culture often don’t have a clear grasp on how lethal modern high explosive munitions are.  A grenade goes off in a movie and it kills the two guys in the physical dust-cloud of the effect; an actual grenade, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M67_grenade" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M67_grenade">like the M67 fragmentation grenade</a> is lethal in a radius of 5 meters and can produce grievous (and also potentially lethal) injuries out to 15 meters and beyond.  Something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-27_Paveway_III" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-27_Paveway_III">2000lbs Paveway III (GBU-27)</a> is supposed to be lethal in excess of 350 meters radius around the point of impact.  Now we’ve discussed before how concealed or entrenched positions can evade or endure that fire, but zombies don’t dig in – a crowd of zombies moving down a road or over a field is <em>exceptionally</em> vulnerable to that kind of firepower.  Again, you don’t need to ‘aim for the head’ if your bomb shreds <em>everything</em> within two hundred yards.  I am put in mind here of the ‘ineffective’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System">M270 MLRS</a> barrage at the <a href="https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yonkers#Equipment" data-type="URL" data-id="https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yonkers#Equipment">‘Battle of Yonkers</a>‘ in <em>World War Z</em> where the rockets are ineffective because the zombies are tightly packed; the <em>actual</em> M270 MLRS fires the M26 rocket (twelve of them) each of which deploys something like 600 (I’ve seen different numbers) cluster-bomblets, each with about the anti-personnel capability of a hand-grenade and enough punch to beat up to 4 inches of armor.  There is no amount of ‘tight packing’ which is going to make that not cause head injuries to (zombie) infantry caught in the open.  Bone and tissue isn’t a meaningful obstacle to the shrapnel created by those cluster-munitions, so packing in the zombies just increases the lethality of the strike.  And let’s keep in mind just how long even ‘fast’ zombies would be under artillery fire; the M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzer has a range of 13 miles.  Assuming our zombies run at around average human sprinting speed (most athletes can sprint around 15mph) and they maintain it continuously (a thing humans cannot do) they’re still under fire for an hour.  And also being handily outpaced by the cars following the speed limit in the right hand lane.</p>



<p>Zombie fiction over covers over this by making the zombies tremendously, inexhaustibly numerous, but again, assuming we’re working on the traditional bite-infection model, the humans merely need to achieve a modestly favorable casualty ratio in order to run the zombies out of zombies.  And I think achieving that sort of a ratio wouldn’t actually be an enormous challenge.  By and large, combatants with automatic weapons tend to have a considerable edge on combatants reduced to clawing and biting (two methods of attack regularly thwarted by <em>clothing</em>).  We haven’t even gotten to things like the use of armor (by which I mean vehicles) – a tank, with the crew buttoned up, doesn’t even need to shoot to be effective, because a 50+ ton armored object moving at 30mph is weapon enough (the top road speed of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams">M1A2 is 42mph</a>, so you are faster than zombie Usain Bolt).  Taking the ‘Battle of Yonkers’ example again, the entire fight could have been won by simply driving the tanks up and down the highway (RIP the highway, but also the zombies).  Tanks have awful gas mileage, but they have appropriately massive fuel capacity to cope; the M1A2 has 265 miles of operational range.  Tanks are designed to resist hostile entry by intelligent humans with tools and potentially explosives; zombies trying to scratch in with their nails are unlikely to succeed.  You might well easily drive down the highway, say 20 miles, crushing as you went, turn around and drive back and have time to refuel while the zombies (average human running speed of 5-6mph) are still running to catch you</p>



<p>And while we’re talking about zombie numbers – a lot of zombie fiction relies on creating great hordes of zombies that equal or exceed the populations of humans they’re derived from.  But definitionally, zombie numbers are limited to the supply of living humans at the onset of the outbreak.  Assuming again this isn’t some hyper-contageous airborn zombie-pathogen with extreme lethality, the zombies are not going to wildly outnumber the humans initially.</p>



<p>And herein we have the zombie-lethality-problem: a zombie, even a fast one, is not actually a very lethal opponent.  Zombies attack with fists, finger-nails and teeth and you only get new zombies when bites actually penetrate.  But biting through even fairly thin fabric is extremely difficult!  Humans, unlike cats or dogs, do not have mouths and teeth designed to disable resisting prey (which is why we needed tools to do that).  Our canine teeth are kind of pathetic – and penetrating thick fabric with teeth or claws is not a sure thing for animals like cats and dogs that <em>do</em> have developed claws and fangs.  By contrast, an adult human with a good kitchen knife or a frying pan (much less a home defense firearm) is substantially more lethal!  Sharp, metal things like shovels and knives can penetrate skulls just fine (much less things like machetes or weaponized entrenching tools).  In the absence of mass numerical superiority that lets zombies mob down individual humans, it’s hard to see how they achieve that higher-than-1:1 casualty ratio they need to not simply fizzle out, even against civilians with improvised weapons.</p>



<p>Honestly, given opponents who can only attack with their teeth and fingernails, I’d go further and say that I’d say the advantage is probably held by any disciplined, iron-age or later army if the issue came to an actual <em>battle</em> rather than an issue of epidemic disease control.  Even thick clothing – much less modern riot armor or combat armor – is likely to be extremely resistant to zombie attack unless the wearer can be pulled down and held down.  The thing is, a dense mass of heavy infantry –  be it modern soldiers with rifles and bayonets (a thing we still issue to troops, by the by) or just men with spears – is effectively immune to such mobbing tactics.  Spanish military performance in the conquest of the Aztecs and the Inca demonstrate what happens when close-order heavy infantry are engaged by far, far larger numbers of enemies whose weapons have at best limited effectiveness against armor.  By way of example, at the Battle of Vilcaconga in 1533, an Inca force of several thousand caught an ambushed a Spanish force of 300, on favorable terrain (a hillside where the Inca had the high ground), with the element of surprise, against an exhausted foe (the Spanish had marched all day)…and still lost (to be clear, it wasn’t guns that won that battle, but swords and pikes).  The Inca took some 800 killed-in-action to the Spanish <em>five</em>.  And those were clever, careful-planning, intelligent Inca, not mindless zombies; it’s also a sign as to why ‘fast zombies’ don’t actually change much here – Inca warriors were presumably every bit as fast.  Again, you can propose massively oversized zombie hoards, but remember they need to achieve at least a 1-to-1 casualty ratio; getting beat 800-to-5 over and over is going to make short work of your zombie apocalypse.</p>



<p>(The Battle of Vilcaconga and the technological and tactical conditions that produced it, discussed in J.F. Guilmartin, “The Cutting Edge: An Analysis of the Spanish Invasion and Overthrow of the Inca Empire, 1532-1539” in K.J. Andrein and R. Adorno, <em>Transatlantic Encounters</em> (1991): 40-69)</p>



<p>So unless the initial infection is hyper-lethal, extremely fast moving and can compromise NBC equipment (but then again, why isn’t your story about super-ebola, rather than zombies), my money would be on industrialized armies and their massive firepower and failing that, on disciplined tight-order formations wearing any kind of armor (including just improvised layered textiles) and using whatever kind of sharp, metal weapons they can get.  If the zombie apocalypse comes down to the zombies matching arms with still functional human militaries, the zombies are hosed.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s it for this week’s deliberations. </strong> There were a lot more questions in the first round of question-asking which were very good and on my to-answer list (I’m hoping to keep a rough balance of historical questions to profession ones to fun, silly ones) so fret not if your question didn’t get answered here, we will get to it eventually.</p>

      <title>Crypto community slams ‘disastrous’ new amendment to big infrastructure bill</title>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Biden’s major bipartisan infrastructure plan struck a rare chord of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, but changes it proposes to cryptocurrency regulation are tripping up the bill.</p>
<p>The administration intends to pay for $28 billion of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/dealbook/infrastructure-bill-details.html">planned infrastructure spending</a> by tightening tax compliance within the historically under-regulated arena of digital currency. That’s why cryptocurrency is popping up in a bill that’s mostly about rebuilding bridges and roads.</p>
<p>The legislation’s vocal critics argue that the bill’s effort to do so is slapdash, particularly a bit that would declare anyone “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” to be a broker, subject to tax reporting requirements.</p>
<p>While that definition might be more straightforward in a traditional corner of finance, it could force cryptocurrency developers, companies and even anyone mining digital currencies to somehow collect and report information on users, something that by design isn’t even possible in a decentralized financial system.</p>
<p>Now, a new amendment to the critical spending package is<a href="https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1423731811096670215"> threatening to make matters even worse</a>.</p>
<h2>Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>In a joint letter about the bill’s text, Square, Coinbase, Ribbit Capital and other stakeholders warned of “financial surveillance” and unintended impacts for cryptocurrency miners and developers. The <a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1422337127556157444">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/">Fight for the Future</a>, two privacy-minded digital rights organizations, also slammed the bill.</p>

<p>Following the outcry from the cryptocurrency community, a pair of influential senators proposed an amendment to clarify the new reporting rules. Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) pushed back against the bill, proposing an amendment with fellow finance committee member Pat Toomey (R-PA) that would modify the bill’s language.</p>
<p>The amendment would establish that the new reporting “does not apply to individuals developing block chain technology and wallets,” removing some of the bill’s ambiguity on the issue.</p>
<p>“By clarifying the definition of broker, our amendment will ensure non-financial intermediaries like miners, network validators, and other service providers — many of whom don’t even have the personal-identifying information needed to file a 1099 with the IRS — are not subject to the reporting requirements specified in the bipartisan infrastructure package,” Toomey said.</p>
<p>Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also threw her support behind the Toomey and Wyden amendment, as did Colorado Governor Jared Polis.</p>

<h2>“Picking winners and losers”</h2>
<p>The drama doesn’t stop there. With negotiations around the bill ongoing — the text could be finalized over the weekend — a pair of senators proposed a competing amendment that isn’t winning any fans in the crypto community.</p>
<p>That amendment, from Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Mark Warner (D-VA), would exempt traditional cryptocurrency miners who participate in energy-intensive “proof of work” systems from new financial reporting requirements, while keeping those rules in place for those using a <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1423113906529177601">“proof of stake” system</a>. Portman worked with the Treasury Department to author the cryptocurrency portion of the original infrastructure bill.</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. Sen. Warner and Portman are proposing a last minute amendment competing with the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment. It is a disastrous. It only excludes proof-of-work mining. And it does nothing for software devs. Ridiculous!</p>
<p>Here is all it excludes: <a href="https://t.co/FA7K6NU2s0">pic.twitter.com/FA7K6NU2s0</a></p>
<p>— Jerry Brito (@jerrybrito) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Rather than requiring an investment in computing hardware (and energy bills) capable of solving increasingly complex math problems, proof of stake systems rely on participants taking a financial stake in a given project, locking away some of the cryptocurrency to generate new coins.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is emerging as an attractive, climate-friendlier alternative that could reduce the need for heavy computing and huge amounts of energy required for proof of work mining. That makes it all the more puzzling that the latest amendment would specifically let proof of work mining off the hook.</p>
<p>Some popular digital currencies like Cardano are already built on proof of stake. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030"> in the process of migrating</a> from a proof of work system to proof of stake to help scale its system and reduce fees. Bitcoin is the most notable digital currency that relies on proof of work.</p>
<p>The Warner-Portman amendment is being touted as a “compromise” but it’s not really halfway between the Wyden-Toomey amendment and the existing bill — it just introduces new problems that many crypto advocates view as a fresh existential threat to their work.</p>
<p>Prominent members of the crypto community, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1422667000950706187">Square founder and Bitcoin booster Jack Dorsey</a>, have thrown their support behind the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment while slamming the second proposal as misguided and damaging.</p>
<p>The executive director of Coincenter, a crypto think tank, called the Warner-Portman amendment “<a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577">disastrous</a>.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed that language. “At the 11th hour @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto,” he tweeted. “… We could find ourselves with the Senate deciding which types of crypto will survive government regulation.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the crypto community — and the promise of the proof of stake model — the White House is apparently<a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1423707773204897794"> throwing its weight behind the Warner-Portman amendment</a>, though that could change as eleventh hour negotiations continue.</p>

Standard monitor widths have been 22-24 inches for a long time, and in many offices we would see 2 of them set up together for a dual screen setup that spanned up to 48 inches.  Along with that trend, we saw an increase in neck strain and pain related to static holding of the neck in a twisted position to view the far left of the display. Coincident? I think not.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593967897423_6539"><div>

      <title>This Captcha Patent Is an All-American Nightmare</title>

    <div><div><div>
<p>A newly formed patent troll is looking for big money from small business websites, just for using free, off-the-shelf login verification tools. </p>
<p>Defenders of the American Dream, LLC (DAD ), is sending out its <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/dad-demand-letter-redacted"><span>demand letters</span></a> to websites that use Google’s reCAPTCHA system, accusing them of infringing <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8621578B1/en"><span>U.S. Patent No. 8,621,578</span></a>. Google’s reCAPTCHA is just one form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA"><span>Captcha test</span></a>, which describes a wide array of test systems that websites use to verify human users and keep out bots. </p>
<p>DAD’s letter tells targeted companies that DAD will take an $8,500 payment, but only if “licensing terms are accepted immediately.” The threat escalates from there. If anyone dares to respond that DAD’s patent might be not infringed, or invalid, fees will rise to at least $17,000. If <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8621578B1/en"><span>DAD’s patent</span></a> gets subject to a legal challenge, DAD says they’ll increase their demand to at least $70,000. In the footnotes, DAD advises its targets that “not-for-profit entities are eligible for a discount.” </p>
<p>The DAD demand letters we have reviewed are nearly identical, with the same fee structure. They mirror the one filed by the company itself (with the fee structure redacted) as part of their trademark application. This demand letter campaign is a perfect example of how the U.S. patent system fails to advance software innovation. Instead, our system enables extortionate behavior like DAD’s exploding fee structure. </p>
<h3><strong>DAD Didn&#39;t Invent Image Captcha</strong></h3>
<p>DAD claims it invented a novel and patentable image-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA"><span>Captcha system</span></a>. But there’s ample evidence of image-based Captcha tests that predate DAD’s 2008 patent application. </p>
<p>The term “Captcha” was <a href="http://www.captcha.net/"><span>coined</span></a> by a group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in 2000. It’s an acronym, indicating a “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.” Essentially, it blocks automated tools like bots from getting into websites. Such tests have been important since the earliest days of the Internet. </p>
<p>Early Captcha tests used squiggly lines or wavy text. The same group of CMU researchers who coined “Captcha” went on to work on an image-selection version they called ESP-PIX, which they had <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/search/Grant_Desc_v32.pdf"><span>published and made public</span></a> by 2005. </p>
<p>By 2007, Microsoft had developed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/"><span>its own image-categorization Captcha</span></a>, which used photos from Petfinder.com, then asked users to identify cats and dogs. At the sime time, PayPal was working on new captchas that “might resemble simple image puzzles.” This was no secret—researchers from both companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/technology/11code.html"><span>spoke to the New York Times</span></a> about their research, and Microsoft filed its own <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090077629A1/en"><span>patent application</span></a>, more than a year before DAD’s. </p>
<p>There’s also evidence of earlier image-based Captcha tests in the patent record, like this early <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080216163A1/en?oq=2008%2F0216163"><span>2008 application</span></a> from a company called Binary Monkeys. Here&#39;s an image from the Binary Monkeys Patent: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2021/08/06/patent_binary_monkey.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s an image from DAD&#39;s patent: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2021/08/06/patent_dad.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>So how did DAD end up with this patent? During patent prosecution, DAD’s predecessor <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/confident-v-best-buy-answer-and-counterclaims"><span>argued</span></a> that they had a novel invention because the Binary Monkeys application asks users to select “all images” associated with the task, as opposed to selecting “one image,” as in DAD’s test. The patent examiner suggested adding yet another limitation: that the user still be granted access to the website if they got one “known” image and one “suspected” image. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, adding trivial tweaks to existing technology, such as small details about the needed criteria for passing a Captcha test, can and often <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/how-amazon-got-a-patent-on-white-background-photography/"><span>does result in a patent being granted</span></a>. This was especially true back in 2008, before patent examiners should have applied guidance from the Supreme Court’s 2014 <em>Alice v. CLS Bank</em> decision. That’s why we have <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/call-action-tell-patent-office-not-reopen-software-patent-floodgates"><span>told the patent office to vigorously uphold Supreme Court guidelines</span></a>, and have defended the Alice precedent in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/congress-should-leave-alice-alone"><span>Congress</span></a>.  </p>
<h3><strong>Where did DAD come from? </strong></h3>
<p>DAD’s patent was originally filed by a Portland startup called Vidoop. In 2010, Vidoop and its patent applications were purchased by a San Diego investor who re-branded it as Confident Technologies. Confident Tech offered a “clickable, image-based CAPTCHA,” but ultimately didn’t make it as a business. In 2017 and 2018, Confident Tech sued Best Buy, Fandango Media, Live Nation, and AXS Group, claiming that the companies infringed its patent by using reCAPTCHA. Those cases all settled.</p>
<p>In 2020, Trevor Coddington, an attorney who worked on Confident Tech’s patent applications, created Defenders of the American Dream LLC. He transferred the patents to this new entity and started sending out demand letters. </p>
<p>They haven’t all gone to large companies, either. At least one of DAD’s targets has been a one-person online publishing company. Coddington’s letter complains about how Confident Tech failed in the marketplace and suggests that because of this, reCAPTCHA users should pay—well, him. The letter states: </p>
<blockquote><p>[O]nce Google introduced its image-based reCAPTCHA for free, no less, [Confident Technologies] was unable to to maintain a financially viable business… Google’s efficient infringement forced CTI to abandon operations and any return on the millions of dollars of capital investment used to develop its patented solutions. Meanwhile, your company obtained and utilized the patented technology <u>for free</u>.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating new and better Captcha software is an area of ongoing research and innovation. While the lawyers and investors behind DAD have turned to patent threats to make money, other developers are actively innovating and competing with reCAPTCHA. There are competing image-based Captchas like <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/"><span>hCaptcha</span></a> and <a href="https://visualcaptcha.net/"><span>visualCaptcha</span></a>, as well as long lists of Captcha alternatives and companies that are <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/"><span>trying to make Captchas obsolete</span></a>. </p>
<p>These individuals and companies are all inventive, but they’re not relying on patent threats to make a buck. They’ve actually written code and shared it online. Unfortunately, because of their real contributions, they’re more likely to end up the victims of aggressive patent-holders like DAD. </p>
<p>We’ll never patent our way to a better Captcha. Looking at the history of the DAD patent—which shares no code at all—makes it clear why the patent system is such a bad fit for software. </p>

      <title>In praise of habits – so much more than mindless reflexes</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___psyche_co_ideas_in-praise-of-habits-so-much-more-than-mindless-reflexes/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Habit is the foundation of</strong> the routines that comprise the vast bulk of our everyday lives. When we are not disturbed, we live our practical lives without engaging in anything like a cautious assessment of what it is we are doing at any given moment. No conscious deliberation or reflection is required to brew morning coffee, or to catch the morning train to work. As the late philosopher Hubert Dreyfus <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467603259868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, habits are a part of our ‘everyday coping practices’.</p>
<p>In tune with this characterisation, philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists alike often conceive of habits as highly mechanistic and near-automatic responses to environmental cues that unfold outside of our deliberative control. This conception of habits as mindless and reflexive might seem intuitive when we recognise that they are often counterproductive to our capacity to pursue our goals and desires. For example, many of us might have recently found ourselves habitually reaching over to shake hands with people even when we had previously acknowledged that we should refrain from doing so in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, even our most mundane habitual routines actually display a great deal of intelligence. Indeed, they are often intelligently context-sensitive and flexible in such a way as can support and structure our goals and projects. Consider the example of driving the same route to work every morning. You might often find yourself wrapped up in thoughts about how your day will unfold, or how you might explain to your boss why you failed to complete some task, and yet you still easily navigate the roads that lead you to your destination. However, despite completing this task on something like autopilot, your drive will still be intelligently adjusted to situational intricacies, such as how fast or slow the driver in front of you is going, or when the traffic lights change. In attempting to account for the intelligent dimension of habit, researchers have moved away from construing habits as unintelligent mechanisms and towards modelling them as a species of belief. The puzzle we face in clarifying the character of habits is to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-020-09735-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explain</a> their intelligent dimension while also acknowledging that they can often work against our intelligence and lead us astray.</p>
<p>Why should we care about the resolution of this puzzle? Great thinkers since before Aristotle have overwhelmingly tended to characterise humans as rational animals in virtue of our capacity to form and intelligently adjust our beliefs. On this view, constructing good habits is vital – but, once a habitual routine is established, it is not itself intelligent. However, if we are serious about attributing intelligence to our embodied interactions with the world, then our notion of how to construe human rationality will need to be revised, and profound questions will need to be raised as to our conceptions of nonhuman animal intelligence.</p>
<p>Gilbert Ryle, in his seminal work <em>The Concept of Mind</em> (1949), emphatically denied that habits were intelligent. (This might surprise some, since Ryle is widely recognised by philosophers as a historical champion of the view that intelligent behaviour is not always guided by theoretical knowledge.) For him, habits are mere mindless mechanisms. Indeed, he explicitly contrasts habitual doings with intelligent and skilful behaviours, claiming that it ‘is of the essence of merely habitual practices that one performance is a replica of its predecessors’. A habit is simply an unintelligent and stupefied way of reacting to the world.</p>
<p>Skill acquisition in sports is often nothing but the process of cultivating a new motor habit through repetitive practice</p>
<p>In <em>On Habit</em> (2014), Clare Carlisle <a href="https://www.routledge.com/On-Habit/Carlisle/p/book/9780415619141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notes</a> that this sort of characterisation of habit – as unintelligent and ‘a degradation of life, reducing spontaneity and vitality to mechanical routine’ – has been held by many influential philosophers of the mind throughout history, including <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/at-a-time-of-zealotry-spinoza-matters-more-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baruch Spinoza</a>, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-immanuel-kants-hydraulic-model-of-moral-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/for-henri-bergson-laughter-is-what-keeps-us-elastic-and-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henri Bergson</a>. Even today, the researchers Susana Ramírez-Vizcaya and Tom Froese <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identify</a> a prevalent notion of habit across several domains of the contemporary cognitive sciences that conceives of them as ‘rigid patterns of behaviour that are automatically activated by context cues’.</p>
<p>One inclined to agree with this mechanical conception of habit as inherently unintelligent might argue that the puzzle we referred to above is simply ill-posed. After all, habits <em>are</em> stupid! On this analysis, any attempt to construe habits as intelligence-involving straightforwardly confuses habit and skill. An implication would be that our above purported examples of intelligent habits (such as the habit of driving the same route to the office every morning, which allows us to effectively reach our workplace, even when we are lost in irrelevant thoughts), insofar as they are intelligent, are not habits – they’re skills.</p>
<p>This view of habits is misguided. Habits are not, despite what Ryle says, simply stupefied and rigid reactions to environmental triggers, or ‘single-track dispositions’ to respond to the world with highly stereotyped reflexes. To see this, we need only note that forging any clear-cut distinction between habit and skill is not even remotely intuitive or feasible. On one hand, many of our skills consist of habits. Skill acquisition in sports, for example, is often nothing but the process of cultivating a new motor habit through repetitive practice. On the other hand, habits often comprise skills. Consider the habit of whistling when you are bored. This is a considerably skilful act, which can in some cases constitute genuine musical expertise. For just these reasons, introducing a clear-cut distinction between skill and habit, such that habitual doings cannot, by definition, be skilled or intelligent, is wrongheaded.</p>
<p><strong>In opposition to the mechanistic</strong> conception of habits, some, such as the philosopher Jason Stanley, <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/jpr/content/jpr_2015_0040Supplement_0315_0323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocate</a> for an intellectualist conception, on which habits are intelligent because they are really a kind of ‘settled belief’ about ways of achieving certain goals. In my initial weeks at a new workplace, I will have developed a belief about how I could successfully get to the office. Through my daily commute, this belief gradually becomes entirely automatic and unconscious. At this stage, I do not need to consciously consider what route I should take to the office but am instead guided by an unconscious belief about how to successfully get there. As this unconscious belief becomes entrenched, it might also become recalcitrant to counterevidence. I might, for instance, accidentally take this route to the office even after I am informed and sincerely convinced that there is a more efficient route. According to intellectualists, a habit is nothing but a deeply entrenched belief of this form. Holding this view, we could preserve the traditional view of human rationality as dependent on belief.</p>
<p>This intellectualist view of habit as a form of belief, however, also has serious problems in accounting for the intelligent aspect of our habitual doings. Habits are, as our above examples show, often exquisitely context-sensitive. But if Stanley takes habitual doings to be intelligent and rational only in virtue of being guided by unconscious beliefs, then he relies on the idea that the intelligent flexibility of habits depends on the flexibility and rapid updating of unconscious beliefs. Emphasising this flexibility conflicts with his claim that habits themselves are guided by stubborn and recalcitrant unconscious beliefs. It is also unclear how unconscious neural processes can even involve beliefs (philosophers have tried in vain for decades to provide a satisfactory account of how they might). As such, if an alternative notion of habits can successfully explain their context-sensitivity without requiring a commitment to positing hidden, unconscious beliefs, then such an account would be more theoretically attractive.</p>
<p>Seen through this pragmatist lens, habits are a treasure trove of possible responses to our environment, constrained by circumstance, but open to the world</p>
<p>Both mechanical and intellectual conceptions of habit encounter significant difficulties in explaining how habits sustain intelligent behaviour. These conceptions have a common root problem, which is a failure to appreciate the pivotal role of perception that philosophers working in the phenomenological and pragmatist traditions have recognised. When we follow them in recognising the crucial role of perception in guiding our habitual doings, we can explain the intelligent aspect of habits while obviating any need to identify them as beliefs.</p>
<p>For Dreyfus, we are no less experts at our everyday habitual routines than Serena Williams is an expert at tennis (albeit what we accomplish might be substantially less impressive). The consequence of this, for him, is that our everyday habits will be guided by expert-level perception and intuition. For instance, many of us have now cultivated social distancing practices. By that measure, as we incorporate these practices into our everyday lives, we are able to proficiently maintain an appropriate distance automatically. When someone next to you in an elevator stands too close, you immediately perceive them as standing too close, and are provoked or ‘solicited’ to move back and restore appropriate distance.</p>
<p>Dreyfus is correct to highlight the important role of perceptual skill in guiding our habitual doings, but we think his account should be revised in one crucial respect. For Dreyfus, as we become experts at completing some everyday routine, the world increasingly draws us to act in one optimal, appropriate way. In other words, we will, as our everyday routines become engrained, come to perceive nothing other than the possibility of pursuing a singular optimal course of action for each situation. To make a long story short, we fear that this renders Dreyfus’s view of habits too close to the mindless, mechanical view of habit that we rejected above.</p>
<p>The pragmatist philosopher <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/dewey-knew-how-to-teach-democracy-and-we-must-not-forget-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Dewey</a> is instructive here. Dewey, like Dreyfus, construes habits as facilitating intelligent behaviour by shaping perception. However, he denies that, as we become experts at carrying out everyday routines, our habitual responses always become entirely automatic response patterns. Instead, for Dewey, writing in <em>Human Nature and Conduct</em> (1922), the ‘more numerous our habits the wider the field of possible observation and foretelling. The more flexible they are, the more refined is perception in its discrimination and the more delicate the presentation evoked by imagination …’ In other words, our habitual doings are intelligently adjusted to context precisely because we perceive the environment in which they have been cultivated in terms of the vast and discriminating habitual responses we might make to it. Habits, seen through this pragmatist lens, then, far from being blunt reflexes, amount to a treasure trove of possible responses to our situated environment, highly constrained by circumstance, but genuinely open to the world. Nor does Dewey deny that our thoughts will almost always be suffused by habit.</p>
<p>Contemporary philosophy of mind is positively <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26748805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replete</a> with <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674007963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warnings</a> that we <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjp.12119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ought</a> not to fall into easy dichotomies between intelligent and voluntary processes on the one hand, and unintelligent and automatic processes on the other. Indeed, even psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman who have influentially <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated</a> for dual-processing views on which the brain comprises two distinct ‘systems’ – one habitual, unconscious, and quick, and another slow, conscious, and reflective – have for years conceded that such a picture is far too simplistic. One sure-fire way to cut right through this dichotomy is to note that, while habits can distort our goals, they can also be exquisitely context-sensitive. Accounting for this context-sensitivity will require acknowledging the pivotal role perceptual skills play in guiding our habitual doings. By recognising the flexible aspects of habits, we further distance ourselves from an outmoded view of intelligent action as one that’s always guided by appropriate intellectual apprehension of knowledgeable beliefs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mixed views on new DNS top level domains (TLDs)</title>
      <link>https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/NewTLDsMyMixedViews</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I have mixed views on new DNS top level domains (TLDs)</h2>

	<p><small>August  4, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1421962079943151620">I said something</a> related
to new TLDs. I have some views on what I said that are for another
entry, but for now I want to sort out some views on new TLDs in
general.</p>

<p>New top level DNS domains come in two flavours; there are country
TLDs (and country-like ones) and what are officially called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">generic
TLDs</a>,
things like &#34;.online&#34; and so on.  Adding new country TLDs is obviously
required and is sensible, and I feel this is also the case for new
TLDs for country-like entities that aren&#39;t strictly countries, such
as the European Union (which is not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1</a>, although &#39;EU&#39; is reserved
for identifying it and it has .eu as a TLD). I think this is most
people&#39;s view on country TLDs, since it&#39;s hard to argue that new
countries should be frozen out of having their own TLD when existing,
older ones get TLDs.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m neutral on the use of country TLDs to create attractive looking
URLs, for example various domains using .ly and .io.)</p>

<p>What I have mixed feelings about are all of the generic, non-country
TLDs (gTLDs), which are sometimes called <em>vanity TLDs</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">There are
a lot of these gTLDs</a> (<a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">also</a>) and <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/the-death-of-a-tld">some
number of them wind up getting shut down after a while</a>, among other
issues. People can also criticize a number of gTLDs for being either
unnecessary or not having a good general use, and some of them have
clashed with common unofficial internal use (for example, .dev,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dev">which also forces HTTPS for all websites in it</a>). All of this makes it sound
like there should be either no new gTLDs at all or at least a lot
fewer of them.</p>

<p>However, the choices for how many new gTLDs to have are none, some,
or as many as people want. If the choice is &#34;some&#34;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority">IANA</a> is
put in the position of deciding which gTLDs and which gTLD purposes
are worthy enough to be approved, and which aren&#39;t. I doubt there&#39;s
any broad agreement on what the criteria for this should be, which
means that IANA would basically be making arbitrary decisions (either
for gTLDs or for the gTLD criteria). The choice of &#34;none&#34; feels
unsatisfactory and excessively conservative; it&#39;s saying that despite
the Internet&#39;s evolution since the original gTLDs were picked (and
despite the wart of .mil), nothing needs to change. That leaves the
choice of allowing as many gTLDs as people want to pay for, which
is the current situation.</p>

<p>So on the one hand I don&#39;t really like the explosion of gTLDs and the
various consequences of that, but on the other hand I&#39;m not sure I
see a better practical choice. You could tinker around the edges, for
example by saying that all gTLDs have to have a public purpose and not
be restricted to a single company (so no .google or .microsoft), but
I don&#39;t think that would be a big change. And I&#39;m not sure that those
company domains are the worst gTLD annoyances.</p>

      <title>Framework Patterns</title>
      <link>https://blog.startifact.com/posts/framework-patterns.html#</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <div>
<p>A software framework is code that calls your (application) code. That&#39;s how we
distinguish a framework from a library. Libraries have aspects of frameworks so
there is a gray area.</p>
<p>My friend Christian Theune puts it like this: a framework is a text where you
fill in the blanks. The framework defines the grammar, you bring some of the
words. The words are the code you bring into it.</p>
<p>If you as a developer use a framework, you need to tell it about your code.
You need to tell the framework what to call, when. Let&#39;s call this
<em>configuring</em> the framework.</p>
<p>There are many ways to configure a framework. Each approach has its own
trade-offs. I will describe some of these framework configuration patterns
here, with brief examples and mention of some of the trade-offs. Many
frameworks use more than a single pattern. I don&#39;t claim this list is
exhaustive -- there are more patterns.</p>
<p>The patterns I describe are generally language agnostic, though some depend on
specific language features. Some of these patterns make more sense in object
oriented languages. Some are easier to accomplish in one language compared to
another.  Some languages have rich run-time introspection abilities, and that
make certain patterns a lot easier to implement. A language with a powerful
macro facility will make other patterns easier to implement.</p>
<p>Where I give example code, I will use Python. I give some abstract code
examples, and try to supply a few real-world examples as well. The examples
show the framework from the perspective of the application developer.</p>
<div id="pattern-callback-function">
<h2>Pattern: Callback function</h2>
<p>The framework lets you pass in a callback function to configure its behavior.</p>
<div id="fictional-example">
<h3>Fictional example</h3>
<p>This is a <cite>Form</cite> class where you can pass in a function that implements what
should happen when you save the form.</p>

<div id="real-world-example-python-map">
<h3>Real-world example: Python map</h3>
<p>A real-world example: <cite>map</cite> is a (nano)framework that takes a (pure) function:</p>
<pre><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>You can go very far with this approach. Functional languages do. If you glance
at React in a certain way, it&#39;s configured with a whole bunch of callback
functions called React components, along with more callback functions called
event handlers.</p>
</div>
<div id="trade-offs">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of this approach as the trade-offs are favorable in many
circumstances. In object-oriented languages this pattern is sometimes ignored
because people feel they need something more complicated like pass in some
fancy object or do inheritance, but I think callback functions should in fact
be your first consideration.</p>
<p>Functions are simple to understand and implement. The contract is about as
simple as it can be for code. Anything you may need to implement your function
is passed in as arguments by the framework, which limits how much knowledge you
need to use the framework.</p>
<p>Configuration of a callback function can be very dynamic in run-time -- you can
dynamically assemble or create functions and pass them into the framework,
based on some configuration stored in a database, for instance.</p>
<p>Configuration with callback functions doesn&#39;t really stand out, which can be a
disadvantage -- it&#39;s easier to see someone subclasses a base class or
implements an interface, and language-integrated methods of configuration
can stand out even more.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to configure multiple related functions at once, in which
case an object that implements an interface can make more sense -- I describe
that pattern below.</p>
<p>It helps if your language has support for function closures. And of course your
language needs to actually support first class functions that you can pass
around -- Java for a long time did not.</p>

subclass. You implement one or more methods that the framework will call.</p>

<div id="real-world-example-django-rest-framework">
<h3>Real-world example: Django REST Framework</h3>
<p>Many frameworks offer base classes - Django offers them, and Django REST
Framework even more.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example from Django REST Framework:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>AccountViewSet</span><span>(</span><span>viewsets</span><span>.</span><span>ModelViewSet</span><span>):</span>

    <span>permission_classes</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>IsAccountAdminOrReadOnly</span><span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>A <cite>ModelViewSet</cite> does a lot: it implements a lot of URLs and request methods to
interact with them. It integrates with Django&#39;s ORM so that you get a REST API
that you can use to create and update database objects.</p>
</div>
<div id="subclassing-questions">
<h3>Subclassing questions</h3>
<p>When you subclass a class, this is what you might need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What base classes are there?</li>
<li>What methods can you override?</li>
<li>When you override a method, can you call other methods on <cite>self</cite> (<cite>this</cite>)
or not? Is there is a particular order in which you are allowed to call these
methods?</li>
<li>Does the base class provide an implementation of this method, or is
it really empty?</li>
<li>If the base class provides an implementation already, you need to know
whether it&#39;s intended to be supplemented, or overridden, or both.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s intended to be supplemented, you need to make sure to call
this method on the superclass in your implementation.</li>
<li>If you can override a method entirely, you may need to know what methods to
use to to play a part in the framework -- perhaps other methods that can be
overridden.</li>
<li>Does the base class inherit from other classes that also let you override
methods? when you implement a method, can it interact with other methods on
these other classes?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="id2">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>Many object-oriented languages support inheritance as a language feature. You
can make the subclasser implement multiple related methods. It seems obvious to
use inheritance as a way to let applications use and configure the framework.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not surprising then that this design is very common for frameworks. But I
try to avoid it in my own frameworks, and I often am frustrated when a
framework forces me to subclass.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that you as the application developer have to start
worrying about many of the questions above. If you&#39;re lucky they are answered
by documentation, though it can still take a bit of effort to understand it.
But all too often you have to guess or read the code yourself.</p>
<p>And then even with a well designed base class with plausible overridable
methods, it can still be surprisingly hard for you to do what you actually
<em>need</em> because the contract of the base class is just not right for your use
case.</p>
<p>Languages like Java and TypeScript offer the framework implementer a way to
give you guidance (<cite>private/protected/public</cite>, <cite>final</cite>). The framework designer
can put hard limits on which methods you are allowed to override. This takes
away some of these concerns, as with sufficient effort on the part of the
framework designer, the language tooling can enforce the contract. Even so such
an API can be complex for you to understand and difficult for the framework
designer to maintain.</p>
<p>Many languages, such as Python, Ruby and JavaScript, don&#39;t have the tools to
offer such guidance. You can subclass any base class. You can override any
method. The only guidance is documentation. You may feel a bit lost as a
result.</p>
<p>A framework tends to evolve over time to let you override more methods in more
classes, and thus grows in complexity. This complexity doesn&#39;t grow just
linearly as methods get added, as you have to worry about their interaction as
well. A framework that has to deal with a variety of subclasses that override a
wide range of methods can expect less from them. Too much flexibility can make
it harder for the framework to offer useful features.</p>
<p>Base classes also don&#39;t lend themselves very well to run-time dynamism - some
languages (like Python) <em>do</em> let you generate a subclass dynamically with
custom methods, but that kind of code is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>I think the disadvantages of subclassing outweigh the advantages for a
framework&#39;s external API. I still sometimes use base classes <em>internally</em> in a
library or framework -- base classes are a lightweight way to do reuse there.
In this context many of the disadvantages go away: you are in control of the
base class contract yourself and you presumably understand it.</p>
<p>I also sometimes use an otherwise empty base class to define an interface, but
that&#39;s really another pattern which I discuss next.</p>

<div id="faking-interfaces">
<h3>Faking interfaces</h3>
<p>Many typed languages offer native support for interfaces. But what if your
language doesn&#39;t do that?</p>
<p>In a dynamically typed language you don&#39;t really <em>need</em> to do anything: any
object can implement any interface. It&#39;s just you don&#39;t really get a lot of
guidance from the language. What if you want a bit more?</p>
<p>In Python you can use the standard library <cite>abc</cite> module, or <cite>zope.interface</cite>.
You can also use the <cite>typing</cite> module and implement base classes and in Python
3.8, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544">PEP-544</a> protocols.</p>
<p>But let&#39;s say you don&#39;t have all of that or don&#39;t want to bother yet as you&#39;re
just prototyping. You can use a simple Python base class to describe an
interface:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>IFormBackend</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>&#34;Load the data from the backend. Should return a dict with the data.&#34;</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>save</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>):</span>
        <span>&#34;Save the data dict to the backend.&#34;</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>
</pre>
<p>It doesn&#39;t do anything, which is the point - it just describes the methods that
the application developer should implement. You could supply one or two with a
simple default implementation, but that&#39;s it. You may be tempted to implement
framework behavior on it, but that brings you into base class land.</p>
</div>
<div id="id4">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>The trade-offs are quite similar to those of callback functions. This is a
useful pattern to use if you want to define related functionality in a single
bundle.</p>
<p>I go for interfaces if my framework offers a more extensive contract that
an application needs to implement, especially if the application
needs to maintain its own internal state.</p>
<p>The use of interfaces can lead to clean composition-oriented designs, where you
adapt one object into another.</p>
<p>You can use run-time dynamism like with functions where you assemble an
object that implements an interface dynamically.</p>
<p>Many languages offer interfaces as a language feature, and any object-oriented
language can fake them. Or have too many ways to do it, like Python.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pattern-imperative-registration-api">
<h2>Pattern: imperative registration API</h2>
<p>You register your code with the framework in a registry object.</p>
<p>When you have a framework that dispatches on a wide range of inputs, and you
need to plug in application specific code that handles it, you are going to
need some type of registry.</p>
<p>What gets registered can be a callback or an object that implements an
interface -- it therefore builds on those patterns.</p>
<p>The application developer needs to call a registration method explicitly.</p>
<p>Frameworks can have specific ways to configure their registries that build on
top of this basic pattern -- I will elaborate on that later.</p>
<div id="id5">
<h3>Fictional Example</h3>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>framework</span> <span>import</span> <span>form_save_registry</span>

<span>def</span> <span>save</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>

</div>
<div id="real-world-example-falcon-web-framework">
<h3>Real-world example: Falcon web framework</h3>
<p>A URL router such as in a web framework uses some type of registry. Here is
an example from the Falcon web framework:</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>QuoteResource</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>on_get</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>):</span>
        <span>...</span> <span>user</span> <span>code</span> <span>...</span>

<span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>falcon</span><span>.</span><span>API</span><span>()</span>
<span>api</span><span>.</span><span>add_route</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;/quote&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>QuoteResource</span><span>())</span>
</pre>
<p>In this example you can see two patterns go together: <cite>QuoteResource</cite>
implements an (implicit) interface, and you register it with a particular
route.</p>
<p>Application code can register handlers for a variety of routes, and the
framework then uses the registry to match a request&#39;s URL with a route, and
then can all into user code to generate a response.</p>
</div>
<div id="id6">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>I use this pattern a lot, as it&#39;s easy to implement and good enough for many
use cases. It has a minor drawback: you can&#39;t easily see that configuration is
taking place when you read code. Sometimes I expose a more sophisticated
configuration API on top of it: a DSL or language integrated registration or
declaration, which I discuss later. But this is foundational.</p>
<p>Calling a method on a registry is the most simple and direct form to register
things. It&#39;s easy to implement, typically based on a hash map, though you can
also use other data structures, such as trees.</p>
<p>The registration order can matter. What happens if you make the same
registration twice? Perhaps the registry rejects the second registration.
Perhaps it allows it, silently overriding the previous one. There is no general
system to handle this, unlike patterns which I describe later.</p>
<p>Registration can be done anywhere in the application which makes it possible to
configure the framework dynamically. But this can also lead to complexity and
the framework can offer fewer guarantees if its configuration can be updated at
any moment.</p>
<p>In a language that supports import-time side effects, you can do your
registrations during import time. That makes the declarations stand out more.
This is simple to implement, but it&#39;s also difficult to control and understand
the order of imports. This makes it difficult for the application developer to
do overrides. Doing a lot of work during import time in general can lead to
hard to predict behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pattern-convention-over-configuration">
<h2>Pattern: convention over configuration</h2>
<p>The framework configures itself automatically based on your use of conventions
in application code. Configuration is typically driven by particular names,
prefixes, and postfixes, but a framework can also inspect other aspects of the
code, such as function signatures.</p>
<p>This is typically layered over the procedural registration pattern.</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails made this famous. Rails will automatically configure the database
models, views and controllers by matching up names.</p>
<div id="id7">
<h3>Fictional example</h3>
<pre><span># the framework looks for things prefixed form_save_. It hooks this</span>
<span># up with `myform` which is defined elsewhere in a module named `forms`</span>

   <span>...</span> <span>application</span> <span>code</span> <span>to</span> <span>save</span> <span>the</span> <span>data</span> <span>somewhere</span> <span>...</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div id="real-world-example-pytest">
<h3>Real-world example: pytest</h3>
<p>pytest uses convention over configuration to find tests. It looks for modules
and functions prefixed by <cite>test_</cite>.</p>
<p>pytest also goes further and inspects the arguments to functions to figure out
more things.</p>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>test_ehlo</span><span>(</span><span>smtp_connection</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>smtp_connection</span><span>.</span><span>ehlo</span><span>()</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>response</span> <span>==</span> <span>250</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>0</span>  <span># for demo purposes</span>
</pre>
<p>In this example, pytest knows that <cite>test_ehlo</cite> is a test, because it is
prefixed with <cite>test_</cite>. It also knows that the argument <cite>smtp_connection</cite> is a
fixture and looks for one in the same module (or in its package).</p>
<p>Django uses convention over configuration in places, for instance when it looks
for the variable <cite>urlpatterns</cite> in a specially named module to figure out what
URL routes an application provides.</p>
</div>
<div id="id8">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>Convention over configuration can be great. It allows the user to type code and
have it work without <em>any</em> ceremony. It can enforce useful norms that makes
code easier to read -- it makes sense to prefix tests with <cite>test_</cite> anyway, as
that allows the human reader to recognize them.</p>
<p>I like convention over configuration in moderation, for some use cases. For
more complex use cases I prefer other patterns that allow registration with
minimal ceremony by using features integrated into the language, such as
annotation or decorator syntax.</p>
<p>The more conventions a framework has, the more disadvantages show up. You have
to learn the rules, their interactions, and remember them. You may sometimes
accidentally invoke them even though you don&#39;t want to, just by using the wrong
name. You may want to structure your application&#39;s code in a way that would be
very useful, but doesn&#39;t really work with the conventions.</p>
<p>And what if you wanted your registrations to be dynamic, based on database
state, for instance? Convention over configuration is a hindrance here, not a
help. The developer may need to fall back to a different, imperative
registration API, and this may be ill-defined and difficult to use.</p>
<p>It&#39;s harder for the framework to implement some patterns -- what if
registrations need to be parameterized, for instance? That&#39;s easy with
functions and objects, but here the framework may need more special naming
conventions to let you influence that. That may lead the framework designer to
use classes over functions, as in many languages these can have attributes with
particular names.</p>
<p>Static type checks are of little use with convention over configuration -- I
don&#39;t know of a type system that can enforce you implement various methods if
you postfix your class with the name <cite>View</cite>, for instance.</p>
<p>If you have a language with enough run-time introspection capabilities such as
Ruby, Python or JavaScript, it&#39;s pretty easy to implement convention over
configuration. It&#39;s a lot harder for languages that don&#39;t offer those features,
but it may still be possible with sufficient compiler magic. But those same
languages are often big on being explicit, and convention over configuration&#39;s
magic doesn&#39;t really fit well with that.</p>

<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>I use this method of configuring software sometimes, but I&#39;m also aware of its
limitations -- I tend to go for language integrated <em>declaration</em>, discussed
below, which looks identical to the end user but is more predictable.</p>
<p>I&#39;m warier than most about exposing this as an API to application developers,
but am happy to use it inside a library or codebase, much like base classes.
The ad-hoc nature of import-time side effects make me reach for more
sophisticated patterns of configuration when I have to build a solid API.</p>
<p>This pattern is lightweight to implement at least in Python -- it&#39;s not much
harder than a registry. Your mileage will vary dependent on language. Unlike
convention over configuration, configuration is explicit and stands out in
code, but the amount of ceremony is kept to a minimum. The configuration
information is co-located with the code that is being registered.</p>
<p>Unlike convention over configuration, there is a natural way to parameterize
registration with metadata.</p>
<p>In languages like Python this is implemented as a possibly significant
import-time side-effect, and may have surprising import order dependencies. In
a language like Rust this is done by compiler macro magic -- I think the Rocket
web framework is an example, but I&#39;m <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/faassen/status/1198341833060999169">still trying to understand how it

<p><a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a> and <a href="https://plone.org/">Plone</a> both are descendants of <a href="https://blog.startifact.com/posts/my-exit-from-zope.html">Zope</a>, and you can use ZCML, a
XML-derived configuration language with them both.</p>
<p>Here is some ZCML from Plone:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;configure</span>
    <span>xmlns=</span><span>&#34;http://namespaces.zope.org/zope&#34;</span>
    <span>xmlns:browser=</span><span>&#34;http://namespaces.zope.org/browser&#34;</span>
    <span>i18n_domain=</span><span>&#34;my.package&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;!-- override folder_contents --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;configure</span> <span>package=</span><span>&#34;plone.app.content.browser&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;browser:page</span>
          <span>for=</span><span>&#34;Products.CMFCore.interfaces._content.IFolderish&#34;</span>
          <span>class=</span><span>&#34;my.package.browser.foldercontents.MyFolderContentsView&#34;</span>
          <span>name=</span><span>&#34;folder_contents&#34;</span>
          <span>template=</span><span>&#34;folder_contents.pt&#34;</span>
          <span>layer=</span><span>&#34;my.package.interfaces.IMyPackageLayer&#34;</span>
          <span>permission=</span><span>&#34;cmf.ListFolderContents&#34;</span>
      <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/configure&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/configure&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>This demonstrates a feature offered by a well-designed DSL: a way to do a
structured override of behavior in the framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="id14">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>Custom DSLs are a very powerful tool if you actually need them, and you do need
them at times. But they are also a lot more heavyweight than the other methods
discussed, and that&#39;s a drawback.</p>
<p>A custom DSL is thorough: a framework designer can build it with very clean
boundaries, with a clear grammar and hard checks to see whether code conforms
to this grammar. If you build your DSL on JSON or XML, you can implement such
checks pretty easily using one of the various schema implementations.</p>
<p>A custom DSL gives the potential for non-developers to configure application
behavior. At some point in a DSL there is a need to interface with user code,
but this may be abstracted away quite far. It lets non-developers reuse code
implemented by developers.</p>
<p>A DSL can be extended with a GUI to make it even easier for non-developers to
configure it.</p>
<p>Since code written in a DSL can be stored in a database, you can store complex
configuration in a database.</p>
<p>A DSL can offer certain security guarantees -- you can ensure that DSL code can
only reach into a limited part of your application.</p>
<p>A DSL can implement a declaration engine with sophisticated behavior -- for
instance the general detection of configuration conflicts (you try to configure
the same thing in conflicting ways in multiple places), and structured, safe
overrides that are independent of code and import order. A DSL doesn&#39;t have to
use such sophistication, but a framework designer that designs a DSL is
naturally lead in such a direction.</p>
<p>A drawback of DSL-based configuration is that it is quite distant from the code
that it configures. That is fine for some use cases, but overkill for others. A
DSL can cause mental overhead -- the applciation developer not only needs to
read the application&#39;s code but also its configuration files in order to
understand the behavior of an application. For many frameworks it can be much
nicer to co-locate configuration with code.</p>
<p>A DSL also provides little flexibility during run-time. While you <em>could</em>
generate configuration code dynamically, that&#39;s a level of meta that&#39;s quite
expensive (lots of generate/parse cycles) and it can lead to headaches for the
developers trying to understand what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>DSL-based configuration is also quite heavy to implement compared to many other
more lightweight configuration options described.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pattern-imperative-declaration">
<h2>Pattern: imperative declaration</h2>
<p>You use a declaration engine like in a DSL, but you drive it from programming
language code in an imperative way, like imperative registration. In fact, an
imperative declaration system can be layered over a imperative registration
system.</p>
<p>The difference from imperative registration is that the framework implements a
deferred configuration engine, instead of making registrations immediately.
Configuration commands are first collected in a separate configuration phase,
and only after collection is complete are they executed, resulting in actual
registrations.</p>
<div id="id15">
<h3>Fictional example</h3>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>framework</span> <span>import</span> <span>Config</span>

<span>def</span> <span>save</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
   <span>...</span> <span>application</span> <span>code</span> <span>to</span> <span>save</span> <span>the</span> <span>data</span> <span>somewhere</span> <span>...</span>

<span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span><span>()</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>form_save</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;my_form&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>save</span><span>)</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>commit</span><span>()</span>
</pre>
<p>The idea here is that configuration registries are only modified when
<cite>config.commit()</cite> happens, and only after the configuration has been validated.</p>
</div>
<div id="real-world-example-pyramid-web-framework">
<h3>Real-world example: Pyramid web framework</h3>
<p>From the Pyramid web framework:</p>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>hello_world</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span><span>)</span>

<span>with</span> <span>Configurator</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>config</span><span>:</span>
    <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>add_route</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#39;/&#39;</span><span>)</span>
    <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>add_view</span><span>(</span><span>hello_world</span><span>,</span> <span>route_name</span><span>=</span><span>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
<p>This looks very similar to a plain registry, but inside something else is going
on: it first collects <em>all</em> registrations, and then generically detects whether
there are conflicts, and generically applies overrides. Once the code exits the
<cite>with</cite> statement, config is complete and committed.</p>
</div>
<div id="id16">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>This brings some of the benefits of a configuration DSL to code. Like a DSL,
the configuration system can detect conflicts (the route name &#39;hello&#39; is
registered twice), and it allows sophisticated override patterns that are not
dependent on the vagaries of registration order or import order.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that configuration can be generated programmatically, so
this allows for a certain amount of run-time dynamism without some the costs
that a DSL would have. It is still good to avoid such dynamism as much as
possible though, as it can make for very difficult to comprehend code.</p>
<p>The code that is configured may still not be not co-located with the
configuration, but at least it&#39;s all code, instead of a whole new language.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pattern-language-integrated-declaration">
<h2>Pattern: language integrated declaration</h2>
<p>You configure the application by using framework-provided annotations for code.
This configuration is declarative and does not immediately take place.</p>
<p>Language integration declaration looks like language integrated registration,
but uses a configuration engine like with imperative declaration.</p>
<div id="id17">
<h3>Fictional example</h3>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>framework</span> <span>import</span> <span>Config</span>

<span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span><span>()</span>

<span># we define and configure the function at the same time</span>
<span>@config.form_save</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;my_form&#39;</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>save</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
   <span>...</span> <span>application</span> <span>code</span> <span>to</span> <span>save</span> <span>the</span> <span>data</span> <span>somewhere</span> <span>...</span>

<span># elsewhere before application starts</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>commit</span><span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div id="real-world-example-morepath-web-framework">
<h3>Real-world example: Morepath web framework</h3>
<p>My own <a href="https://morepath.readthedocs.io">Morepath</a> web framework is configured this way.</p>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>morepath</span>

<span>class</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>morepath</span><span>.</span><span>App</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>@App.path</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>=</span><span>&#39;/hello&#39;</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Hello</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>@App.view</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>=</span><span>Hello</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>view_get</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>&#34;Hello world!&#34;</span>
</pre>
<p>Here two things happen: an instance of <cite>Hello</cite> is registered for the route
<cite>/hello</cite>, and a <cite>GET</cite> view is registered for such instances. You can supply
these decorators in any order in any module -- the framework will figure it
out. If you subclass <cite>App</cite>, and re-register the <cite>/hello</cite> path, you have a new
application with new behavior for that path, but the same view.</p>
</div>
<div id="id18">
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>I like this way of configuring code very much, so I built a framework for it.</p>
<p>This <em>looks</em> very similar to language-integrated <strong>registration</strong> but the
behavior is declarative.</p>
<p>It&#39;s more explicit than convention over configuration, but still low on
ceremony, like language-integrated registration. It co-locates configuration
with code.</p>
<p>It eliminates many of the issues with the more lightweight language-integrated
registration while retaining many of its benefits. It imposes a lot of
structure on how configuration works, and this can lead to useful properties:
conflict detection and overrides, for instance.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a lot more heavy-weight than just passing in a callback or object with an
interface -- for many frameworks this is more than enough ceremony, and nothing
beats how easy that is to implement and test.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t store it in a database or give it to a non-programmer: for that, use
a DSL.</p>
<p>But if want a configuration language that&#39;s powerful and friendly, this is a
good way to go.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a lot more difficult to implement though, which is a drawback. If you use
Python, you&#39;re in luck: I&#39;ve implemented a framework to help you build this,
called <a href="https://dectate.readthedocs.io">Dectate</a>. My <a href="https://morepath.readthedocs.io">Morepath</a> web framework is built on it.</p>
<p>In Dectate, import-time side-effects are minimized: when the decorator is
executed the parameters are stored, but registration only happens when
<cite>commit()</cite> is executed. This means there is no dependence on run-time import
order, and conflict detection and overrides are supported in a general way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this helps developers who have to deal with frameworks to understand the
decisions made by these frameworks better. If you have a problem with a
framework, perhaps I gave you some arguments that lets you express it better as
well.</p>
<p>And if you design a framework -- which you should do, as larger applications
need frameworks to stay coherent -- you now hopefully have some more concepts
to work with to help you make better design decisions.</p>

					<p>Archaeologists have uncovered the world’s oldest known coin mint, along with pieces of spade-shaped metal currency, inside a bronze foundry dating to 770 B.C.E. in Guanzhuang, China. Using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating, the new research, published this month in <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.94" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Antiquity</em></a>, reveals the coin mint began operating between 640 and 550 B.C.E., after the foundry switched from producing other valuable items to creating currency.</p>
<p>This discovery marks Guanzhuang as the world’s oldest-known <a href="https://www.artnews.com/t/minting/" id="auto-tag_minting" data-tag="minting">minting</a> site. Guanzhuang is located near the Yellow River in the Central Plains of China and was founded in 800 B.C.E. It was subsequently abandoned sometime after 450 B.C.E. Archaeological excavations of the city have been ongoing since 2011, where researchers have uncovered fortifications, including wall foundations and moats. “Ceramics, burials and historical records suggest that the site was a regional centre of the Zheng State,” the researchers write.</p>

<p>In the outer city, just beyond the inner gate, a craft-production area was discovered. It would have once been host to workshops for the creation of bronze, ceramic, jade, and bone artifacts. Of these structures, the bronze foundry was the largest, with over 2,000 pits for production waste—some almost ten feet wide and eight feet deep. Found there were the remains of tools used to cast the artifacts, including crucibles and ladles.</p>
<p>Archaeologists also discovered bronze droplets, unfinished or broken bronze artifacts, and charcoal and furnace fragments. There were ceramic sherds, too, as well as over 6,000 clay molds that were used to produce high-status ritual vessels, weapons, chariot fittings, musical instruments, ornaments, and tools.</p>
<p>The foundry was close to Guanzhuang’s inner city and its administrative center, though researchers said it was uncertain whether the foundry began minting <a href="https://www.artnews.com/t/coins/" id="auto-tag_coins" data-tag="coins">coins</a> upon government orders. “It is about 150 years later [after its initial establishment] that the minting activities appeared in this foundry,” said Hao Zhao, lead author of the paper and researcher at Zhengzhou University, in a statement. Soon after its transition, however, other foundries across China followed suit.</p>

					<span>Unused clay cores for casting spade coins and coin SP-2.</span>

</div>

<p>The team found 54 clay cores for casting hollow-handled spade coins—22 unused cores and 32 discarded core heads—providing evidence that the entire minting process, including mold-making and coin-casting, was performed in the foundry. All the clay cores were very similar, meaning there was a “high degree of standardization [in the] spade coins minted at Guanzhuang,” according to the researchers. “The clay cores were carefully made with the aid of a measuring tool to regulate their size and minimize variation.”</p>

<p>Spade coins—some of the earliest currency in the world—are thought to represent an association between the weeding tool they are shaped after and a form of standardized money. Two spade coins were found at Guanzhuang, along with the clay molds used to cast them. The most complete example of the pair is a pointed-shoulder spade that originally measured over five inches long, with three parallel lines on its surface. “The inner clay core is still embedded in the socket of the coin handle,” write the researchers. Only the handle survives of the second fragment, but both coins would have been identical.</p>
<p>The Guanzhuang coin mint is the first of its kind in China ever to be dated with certainty. It also represents the world’s earliest known standardized metal currency. Other known examples include the Lydian Lion, a coin made of electrum and a predecessor to the coins of ancient Greece and Rome, and the Persian daric, a gold coin of the Achaemenid Empire.</p>
<p>“Making coins was one of the most revolutionary financial innovations in human history,” said Zhao, noting that wealth was easier to trade, count, and hoard after the invention of the minting process.</p>

      <title>Planning for Servers in 2022 and Beyond</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_servethehome_com_planning-for-servers-in-2022-and-beyond-series_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <!-- image --><div><figure><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Changes-to-Servers-2022-Cover-Web.jpg" data-caption="Changes To Servers 2022 Cover Web"></a><figcaption>Changes To Servers 2022 Cover Web</figcaption></figure></div>
            <!-- content --><p>Over the past few months, regular readers will have noticed that we have been running a series looking at the key technologies that will impact our readers in the next few quarters. The transition of server architecture in 2022 is going to be quite unlike what we saw in the Xeon E5 era from ~2012 to 2017 and one could argue even through Skylake/ Naples bringing that to 2019. The fact around seven years of relatively low innovation means that there are now folks with 9-10 years of experience that have never seen a massive shift in server architecture. Our Planning for Servers in 2022 and Beyond series has been focused on showing just how much will change in the very near future.<span id="more-54843"></span></p>
<h2>CPUs and Interconnects in 2022 and Beyond</h2>
<p>The relatively well-known changes to server CPUs in 2022 will be the DDR5 transition along with higher core counts. We have covered the move to chiplets and more advanced packaging for some time and these technologies will help drive much of the industry’s change over the next few years.</p>
<figure id="attachment_50367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50367"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xe-hpc-ponte-vecchio-shows-next-gen-packaging-direction/intel-xe-hpc-ponte-vecchio-package-brighter/" rel="attachment wp-att-50367"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50367">Intel Xe HPC Ponte Vecchio Package Brighter</figcaption></figure>
<p>We also focused on some of the less-discussed changes. One of them is simply the increase in onboard “close” memory on CPUs that we will see in different forms starting really in 2022. We discussed this in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/server-cpus-transitioning-to-the-gb-onboard-era/">Server CPUs Transitioning to the GB Onboard Era</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why Server CPUs Are Going from MB to GB Onboard" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWhrKNbKrK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We also discussed the transition to Arm servers and how that ecosystem is evolving in our review of a modern Arm server platform in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-wiwynn-mt-jade-server-review-the-most-significant-arm-server/">Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server Review The Most Significant Arm Server</a>. This will be a big change and will have a slightly different focus than many of the x86 servers we have seen to date.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Most Significant Server of 2020 from Wiwynn and Ampere" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jESiMLQVNf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving beyond the chips themselves, CXL will become an enormous force in the industry starting in 2022 but then picking up as we get to CXL 2.0 and beyond. You can check out our piece: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/compute-express-link-or-cxl-what-it-is-and-examples/">Compute Express Link or CXL What it is and Examples</a> for more on that.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="CXL in Next-gen Servers Will Make Today&#39;s Servers Obsolete" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mp9L7OClb2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The CPU, and perhaps more importantly, the role of the CPU in servers is going to change drastically over the next few quarters. After CXL we will get Gen-Z and have already started seeing systems with prototypes for that such as with our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/gen-z-in-dell-emc-poweredge-mx-and-cxl-implications/">Gen-Z in Dell EMC PowerEdge MX</a> piece.</p>
<h2>Storage Trends</h2>
<p>One of the biggest trends we are going to see is the EDSFF shift to the various E1 and E3 form factors. This is going to be the shift away from rotating disk-based form factors and into something that is designed for PCIe/ CXL devices including flash storage. EDSFF allows for more power and cooling potential for higher-power devices whether that is traditional SSDs, computational storage devices, or even AI accelerators. You can read more about that in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/e1-and-e3-edsff-to-take-over-from-m-2-and-2-5-in-ssds-kioxia/">E1 and E3 EDSFF to Take Over from M.2 and 2.5 in SSDs</a> article.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EDSFF E1 and E3 to Replace M.2 and U2/U3/2.5in SSDs in Data Centers" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/29Nh3p6779E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We also discussed the Intel Optane persistent memory and how that will change a bit in future generations, including why Micron shifted its focus from DIMM-attached 3D XPoint. You can read about that in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/glorious-complexity-of-intel-optane-dimms-and-micron-exiting-3d-xpoint/">Glorious Complexity of Intel Optane DIMMs and Micron Exiting 3D XPoint</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Glorious Complexity of Intel Optane DIMMs and Why Micron Quit" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOV3gGncGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are still a few more storage pieces we want to cover. We covered SAS4 a number of times, but we felt these are going to be the more impactful changes.</p>
<h2>Networking and Fabric</h2>
<p>On the networking side, the industry over the last 12 months or so has coalesced around the DPU terminology. We have a bit about why DPUs are needed and how to determine if a device is a DPU in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">What is a DPU A Data Processing Unit Quick Primer</a>.</p>

<p>We also have the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dpu-vs-smartnic-sth-nic-continuum-framework-for-discussing-nic-types/">STH NIC Continuum Framework</a> that we are using to evaluate different types of network devices. The DPU space, for example, has many types of devices and although in the lab we have mostly shown the Mellanox-NVIDIA BlueField-2 in STH articles, we also have done hands-on with the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/fungible-dpu-based-storage-cluster-hands-on-look/">Fungible DPU-based Storage Cluster</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DPU vs SmartNIC vs Exotic FPGAs A Guide to Differences and Current DPUs" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOeketsa96I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Networking is an area that continually must evolve to faster iterations in order to deal with not just bigger servers, but also faster-connected devices with technologies such as 5G at the edge. We have done a number of AI platforms and O-RAN platform reviews at STH, but it is always fun to look at the switches. One example is the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inside-an-innovium-teralynx-7-based-32x-400gbe-switch/">Inside an Innovium Teralynx 7-based 32x 400GbE Switch</a>. This week we covered <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-acquiring-innovium-for-high-end-switch-asic/">Marvell Acquiring Innovium</a> in recognition of this trend and platform.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Inside a 400GbE 32-port Teralynx 7 Hyper-scale Switch" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1qmvr-VYw8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking beyond these 32x 400GbE switches, we are going to transition to an era of needing <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hands-on-with-the-intel-co-packaged-optics-and-silicon-photonics-switch/">silicon photonics and co-packaged optics</a>. That will have to happen perhaps not in 2022, but we are only a few years away.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hands-on with Intel Co-Packaged Optics and Silicon Photonics Switch" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Esgyj26vdxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We have also been covering the transition to 2.5GbE for the campus edge but those are less focused on traditional servers. We have also looked at some of the accelerators for 5G infrastructure since that is an entire space with a massive amount of investment.</p>
<h2>AI Accelerators</h2>
<p>The AI accelerator market will move to the OAM form factor that we started covering in 2019 in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/facebook-ocp-accelerator-module-oam-launched/">Facebook OCP Accelerator Module OAM Launched</a> and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/facebook-zion-accelerator-platform-for-oam/">Facebook Zion Accelerator Platform for OAM</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_33552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33552"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/facebook-zion-accelerator-platform-for-oam/facebook-zion-oam-module-with-cooling/" rel="attachment wp-att-33552"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-33552">Facebook Zion OAM Module With Cooling</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are seeing OAM as a major force in the AI accelerator industry in 2022 and beyond even if there are some very cool alternatives out there such as making one large chip as <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/our-interview-with-andrew-feldman-ceo-of-cerebras-systems/">Cerebras Systems</a> does.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37642"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-t4-ai-inferencing-gpu-review/nvidia-tesla-t4-back/" rel="attachment wp-att-37642"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37642">NVIDIA Tesla T4 Back</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the edge, we now have almost a dozen articles focused on using cards like the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-t4-ai-inferencing-gpu-review/">NVIDIA T4</a> or PCIe-based A100 modules for edge inferencing in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/asus-rs720a-e11-rs24u-review-amd-epyc-7763-and-nvidia-a100-in-2u/">traditional servers</a> but also <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inspur-ne3412m5-edge-ai-and-storage-platform-review-intel-xeon/">mobile/ ruggedized</a> and ORAN style form factors. Since a huge application is going to be video analytics we have started on more video/ edge AI platforms such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/xilinx-kria-kv260-fpga-based-video-ai-development-kit-is-a-huge-step/">Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA-based Video AI Development Kit</a> since these platforms will be part of a tidal shift in data flowing from the edge to the core of networks. AI inference will be a feature in almost every server in the very near future and that will cover the cloud to the edge in that statement.</p>
<h2>Power and Cooling</h2>
<p>Recently we just looked at some of the liquid cooling options in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/liquid-cooling-next-gen-servers-getting-hands-on-3-options-supermicro/">Liquid Cooling Next-Gen Servers Getting Hands-on with 3 Options</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Liquid Cooling High-End Servers Direct to Chip, Rear Door, and Immersion Cooling" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Np1HnWiHb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The next generation of servers will certainly use more power and require more cooling so we have started covering those solutions. They are a major reason we are working on a massive behind-the-scenes upgrade.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Friday piece was simply to discuss some of the biggest changes that we have been covering on STH that will happen in 2022 and beyond. These are the immediate changes as the pace of innovation in the data center speeds up. For our readers who feel more comfortable in the slower pace of innovation from 2012 to 2017 or 2019, starting next year we are going to see massive shifts. The implication of this is that planning needs to happen today to ensure facilities are ready to take on the new operating models in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p>Some of our keen readers will also notice that we have focused on doing videos for many of these big 2022 and beyond topics. There are still several on the to-do list and some that we have covered and not featured above, but there is also limited time until the next generation arrives. The point is: get ready for a wild ride.</p>

      <title>What Do You Do with a Billion Grams of Surplus Weed?</title>

	<div>
		<p><span>B</span><span>ack in 2018</span>, during those months before Canada legalized recreational cannabis, things were good for the pot industry. Companies were being hyped as pioneers in “the green frontier” and “proof that money grows on trees.” Cannabis stocks were going ballistic, and three of the largest companies’ share values had each increased by more than 200 percent over the course of 2017—according to media outlet <em>MJBizDaily</em>, the Canadian Marijuana Index had risen by 117 percent in December of that year alone. Investors were not just making money, they were making money <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the hype more obvious than Smiths Falls, Ontario, where a mundane press event one hot summer day in August 2018—the opening of cannabis producer Tweed’s visitors’ centre—offered a bizarre study of an industry primed for ascension. About a dozen TV cameras were present, plus photographers, reporters, dignitaries of the local business community, and politicians, all crowding through a routine facility tour. The event was a master class in buzz generation: it featured sample chocolates and an invitation to imagine them dosed with cannabis; production rooms that were still half empty and an invitation to imagine them finally full in a few short months; a gift shop and café and an invitation to imagine them packed with happy buyers. That all of it seemed somewhat half-finished could be glossed over—the promise of prosperity was obvious.</p>
<p>The town of Smiths Falls had come to see cannabis as a path to economic salvation. It had been hurting since 2008, when chocolatier Hershey closed shop. Tweed moving into the old chocolate plant in 2013 gave residents reasons both real and symbolic to be hopeful. As far as any of the company and government folks on the junket were concerned, Smiths Falls was ground zero for a new worldwide movement. The mayor called it the cannabis capital of the universe, and perhaps he was right. A few US states had piloted recreational cannabis, but this felt different—Canadian legalization would create a national industry with the sheen of a social revolution. Prohibition and the unequal criminalization of cannabis were, in principle, coming to an end. Global brands were in the making. Multinational corporations were on the rise. Countries across the world were going to look at Canada and be inspired—we were the future.</p>

<p>Three years later, much of that hype has vanished, and now both industry and government are beginning thorough post-mortems of what is, and isn’t, working with pot legalization. The lavish A-list parties, so common in the early days, were petering out even before COVID-19 arrived. Barely more than half of all pot sales today are conducted through the legal market (and that milestone was only recently reached). Back in early 2019, Tweed—later renamed Canopy Growth Corporation—had a valuation north of $20 billion and active growing facilities in St. John’s, Fredericton, Bowmanville, Edmonton, and Saskatchewan, as well as two in BC’s Lower Mainland. In the last year, all seven have been closed or sold. At the original location, in Smiths Falls, layoffs are a regular occurrence. Since 2018, total reported net losses amount to more than $3.8 billion. Across the industry as a whole, total losses since 2015 are north of $10 billion. </p>
<p>The most poignant sign of the failure of the cannabis business, however, might be sitting in warehouses across the country. At its peak, last October, following the 2020 growing season, there was about 1.1 billion grams of harvested or processed cannabis held in storage: 95 percent of inventory has not been purchased by retailers or wholesalers, and much of it is “assumed to be largely unsaleable,” writes <em>MJBizDaily</em>’s Matt Lamers, whether because of degradation or excess supply. We have more pot in this country than we can possibly sell. Producers today are sitting on a massive, and predictable, oversupply that is slowly becoming worthless—and that’s going to cost a lot of companies a lot of money.</p>

<p><span>T</span><span>he industry’s woes</span> can be traced in part to its temporarily lucrative early relationship with investment capital. After Justin Trudeau’s Liberals took power, in 2015, elected in part on the promise of pot, large producers, including Canopy Growth and Aurora, sought out listings on a variety of Canadian stock exchanges. They were after retail investors, and producers hired third-party investor-relations firms to promote their stocks as a once-in-a-generation chance to get in on the ground floor not just of a company but of an entire industry. Strong retail investment soothed whatever lingering anxieties Bay Street might have had about the sector. “The cannabis boom was an investment banker’s dream,” wrote Mark Rendell and Tim Kiladze in a 2019 <em>Globe and Mail</em> article. “With so much retail investor demand, it was easy to underwrite share sales—and to dictate the terms of the game.”</p>
<p>In the absence of any other metrics, like revenue or sales projections, investors learned to judge a company by “funded capacity,” a rough measure of how much cannabis a given company could potentially grow on the land it possessed. The result was a production arms race: more investment meant new facilities, which meant more production, which meant more investment, which meant more money pushed into production. This cycle went on and on.</p>
<p>“Cannabis investors asked for a big scale of production when they should have asked for a good scale of sales,” says John Fowler, the former CEO of The Supreme Cannabis Company, one of the producers that attracted a lot of buzz early on. (Supreme’s stock price doubled over the back half of 2017, and its market cap peaked in early 2018—nearly a full year before legal pot actually went on sale.) “They shouldn’t have talked about funding capacity, thrown money behind anybody who was going to build square footage.”</p>
<p>The logic governing the industry ahead of legalization tended to assume that any pot a company could grow would ultimately be sold. Licensed producers were accounting for their cannabis in ways that didn’t always make sense—valuing their inventory on their balance sheets similarly to stable commodities like vegetables, which have relatively consistent market prices and are more-or-less guaranteed to sell. (That many of the executives in the industry at that time had backgrounds in alcohol and commodities, where the price of a product and its path to market are more stable, likely played a role.) Really, cannabis had neither: nobody was exactly sure what the market price for retail pot would be, nor did anyone have a concrete idea of what consumers actually wanted. But pretending otherwise made the companies look great on paper. Valuation corresponded most with funded capacity, which is how you got a $20 billion company that hadn’t sold a single gram to recreational buyers. “Gross margins in the sector are distorted as a result, making firms look more profitable than they really are,” wrote Joe Castaldo in <em>Maclean’s</em> in early 2018, peeling back the layers of this accounting practice.</p>
<p>Producers themselves often did little to dispel this idea. Fowler recalls companies keeping and storing fan leaves (leaves that contain low levels of psychoactive cannabinoids) at a higher value than they were worth to bolster their balance sheets. “This was five years ago—nobody was asking questions. All the company has to do is say, ‘Well, we’re hopeful we’re going to find a way to make oil out of this, so let’s keep it on the balance sheet.’”</p>

<p>But, for investors who saw stock prices going gangbusters throughout 2017 and early 2018, the weed game was already profitable. The business model at that time didn’t demand actual weed sales: selling hype, selling the <em>potential</em> of selling weed, was proving lucrative. Stories of everyday Canadians getting rich on pot stocks fanned the flames even further. Investment was cast as a high-risk, huge-reward opportunity. Plus, it was providing massive amounts of capital to companies that needed to build highly specialized facilities to adhere to strict government regulations. With help from this investor enthusiasm, the industry expanded to 102 licensed producers by April 2018. The investments in facilities, massive hiring sprees, and fantastical marketing budgets all followed, undeterred by projections that it would be years before most producers turned any profit.</p>
<p>“There were steps along the way where decisions were made by big companies that . . . made sense at the time,” says Jay Rosenthal, a long-time industry analyst. “Public markets were responding to funded capacity. . . . The more capacity you had, the more people believed your company was going to be real and therefore would invest in your stock.”</p>
<p>Fowler makes a similar point. “It was advantageous for companies to keep that legend alive,” he says. “When the market was still giving people credit for so many years of forward sales, nobody wanted to stick up their hand and be a wet blanket and say, ‘Hey, we don’t think those sales are going to happen.’”</p>
<p>In the early days of legalization, product shortages, illustrated by news footage of lineups for stores with emptied shelves, reinforced the idea that more production capacity was needed. Under pressure to quickly supply the legal market and to stop wasting bureaucratic time, Health Canada adjusted its approval process to require that companies have a facility in place before they could be licensed. The idea was to bump serious players with existing assets to the front of the line and stop approving licences for facilities that were still speculative. By late 2019, the market had flipped into oversupply, but even then, little was done to slow the pace of production. The capitalist logic of the market had pushed large producers to make ever more cannabis—to strive tirelessly to outproduce their competition, to drive down production costs, and to flood the market with more and more pot products whether people wanted them or not.</p>
<p><span>L</span><span>egalization has always</span> had critics from within the cannabis world, people who see a lost opportunity to support smaller, more sustainable producers as the bedrock of the cannabis industry. The know-how already existed in the many operations that had supplied unregulated markets for generations. Rather than constructing a hybrid system that legitimized parts of the existing cannabis market, the federal government set up a highly regulated system over which Health Canada maintained significant control. The result was an industry that was politically palatable but whose corporate character could feel alienating to some veterans of the cannabis world.</p>
<p>By the time legalization took effect, Tim Barnhart had already been selling weed commercially for a few years, beyond the reach of the Canadian government, out of his Legacy 420 store on Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, east of Toronto. He has watched the way cannabis legalization has played out from an Indigenous vantage: seeing corporations claim to be pioneering what he was already doing pretty sustainably for his own people. </p>
<p>Barnhart also saw some of these well-funded companies using their influence to impact regulations in selfish ways. In one memorable example, Canopy Growth’s former CEO, Bruce Linton, lobbied hard against outdoor growing, famously floating the theory to Senate members visiting the company’s facility that teenagers could ransack a licensed grower via drones.</p>
<p>“Had you had medical growers in there, and Indigenous Canadians, I think you would have had a set of good hybrid regulations, but what you have today is the financialization of [cannabis], and it’s not working for anybody—not even the LPs,” Barnhart says, referring to licensed producers.</p>
<p>There is a growing sense that things have not gone to plan. Since its high point in January 2018, the Canadian Marijuana Index has dropped by about 82 percent. There has also been turnover among many high-profile executives—Linton and Fowler, as well as leaders at Aphria and 48North, among them. The largest companies still rarely, if ever, report quarterly profits as an era of mergers and acquisitions begins to consolidate the market. The first half of 2021 saw Canopy Growth’s purchase of Supreme and the merger of Tilray and Aphria—two of the first and largest companies on the scene.</p>
<p>“Just as I don’t think any company in the industry would tell you they’ve gotten every decision right, nor should we expect that the federal government has gotten every decision right,” says Ryan Greer, former co-chair of the National Cannabis Working Group. The government is required to undertake a review of the Cannabis Act’s wider impact starting no later than this October, but the industry is getting a head start by leading its own analysis, highlighting issues like burdensome regulations and supply chain issues—or, as Greer summarizes, “general overall regulatory burden. It is a very costly and cumbersome process to navigate.”</p>

<p>Some now see an industry that has strayed from its original anti-prohibition path and failed in ways that feel distinctly capitalist. “There are people who aren’t able to fill their full prescriptions with legal cannabis because of costs,” says Caryma Sa’d, a lawyer and the executive director of cannabis-advocacy organization NORML Canada. A recent survey conducted by Abacus Data for Medical Cannabis Canada found that those who access medical cannabis legally pay on average 34 percent more for their medicine than if they bought from the unregulated market.</p>
<p>And yet, cannabis producers are throwing away more product than ever before. Since 2018, nearly 450 million grams of unpackaged cannabis have been destroyed, according to reporting from <em>MJBizDaily</em>. Nearly 280 million grams of that was from 2020 alone, representing almost 20 percent of all production that year. (An “expected” loss in commercial growing is between 5 and 8 percent.) Add to that nearly 3.8 million finished packages of dried flower, 1.5 million packages of extracts, and more than 700,000 packaged edibles. </p>
<p>“Maybe this is a feature of capitalism,” Sa’d says. “We are throwing out food while people go hungry; we have empty houses and people are homeless. So to see that replicated in the cannabis space is unfortunate but perhaps unsurprising.”</p>
<p>The question is not whether there is money to be made in cannabis—almost all experts agree that the pot business is viable in the long run—but why the industry’s most well-funded producers have been so consistently unable to turn a profit on something once talked about as a licence to print money. Canadians spent roughly $2.6 billion on legal cannabis in 2020—a healthy amount, but far short of the $6.5 billion that CIBC projected in 2018. Even in a year that saw legal cannabis finally comprise more than half the market, the biggest companies are still in the red: Aurora reported more than $3 billion in losses for 2020; Canopy Growth’s losses totalled $1.3 billion; Tilray lost $271 million (US). As Dan Sutton, CEO of the boutique producer Tantalus Labs, put it in an interview with <em>BIV</em>, “Today there are no consistently profitable cannabis cultivators—big or small—in Canada. Zero.”</p>
<p><span>W</span><span>hile the financial</span> losses keep piling up, the industry is beginning to change. After a sluggish rollout, more “microcultivators” are gaining licences for smaller craft operations. A smaller scale of production could be a more sustainable business model, but even these seem ill-fitting within a heavily regulated cannabis economy. Forced, in most cases, to sell to a provincial wholesaler along with everyone else in the sector, craft producers can struggle to gain traction when they come up against the marketing departments of the Auroras and Canopies. The business model that underwrote the early days of legalization has yet to stabilize, and a long-expected phase of difficult bankruptcies, mergers, and consolidation—meaning mass layoffs and abandoned growing facilities—is here.</p>
<p>A drive through Tyendinaga or Kettle Point, Ontario, on the other hand, offers a window into another way forward: a sovereign, self-regulating Indigenous cannabis trade. Shops along the road are located just a few kilometres away from the field where the cannabis is grown. The quality is often quite good. Some of the shops are supported by Legacy 420’s nation-to-nation wholesale and quality-testing services. If nothing else, these operations demonstrate that safe cannabis sales aren’t the exclusive dominion of highly regulated shareholder capitalism—that safely growing and selling pot need not require a degree in capital finance.</p>
<p>“Done the right way, it can be a lucrative industry,” Barnhart says. “But Canada didn’t get it right. So now they have a costly product, a surplus that’s all dried out, and I don’t know what they’re going to do. There’s going to be huge corporate write-down again, and I’m not sure where that’s going to leave a lot of these players.”</p>

<p>While participants would not need to strap into a rocket and blast off into the final frontier, they would help pave the way for the future of space exploration, all without ever leaving the ground.</p>

  <p>&#34;The series of missions - known as Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog - includes three one-year Mars surface simulations based at NASA&#39;s Johnson Space Center. The analogs will support research to develop methods and technologies to prevent and resolve potential problems on future human spaceflight missions to the Moon and Mars,&#34; according to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-is-recruiting-for-yearlong-simulated-mars-mission" target="_blank">NASA</a>. <br/></p><p>The missions will involve four people living in a module where they will encounter various challenges simulating a mission on the Red Planet.</p><p>&#34;The analog is critical for testing solutions to meet the complex needs of living on the Martian surface,&#34; said Grace Douglas, lead scientist for NASA&#39;s Advanced Food Technology research effort at the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. &#34;Simulations on Earth will help us understand and counter the physical and mental challenges astronauts will face before they go.&#34;</p><p>NASA is calling for non-smoking applicants who are either American citizens or permanent residents proficient in the English language and between the ages of 30 and 55. NASA, which noted that compensation is available for taking part, also described various qualifications related to education and experience. </p><p>&#34;Each mission will consist of four crew members living and working in a 1,700-square-foot module 3D-printed by ICON, called Mars Dune Alpha. The habitat will simulate the challenges of a mission on Mars, including resource limitations, equipment failure, communication delays, and other environmental stressors. Crew tasks may include simulated spacewalks, scientific research, use of virtual reality and robotic controls, and exchanging communications. The results will provide important scientific data to validate systems and develop solutions,&#34; NASA explained.</p><p>While there are ambitions to return to the moon and reach Mars in the future, humans have not been back to the moon since 1972.</p></div>

</span></p><p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar Airways said Thursday it grounded 13 Airbus A350s over what it described as fuselages “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft, further escalating a monthslong dispute with the European airplane maker over the issue.</p>


<p>While Airbus declined to specifically discuss the announcement, Qatar Airways&#39; decision to ground the aircraft raised questions about the A350s&#39; carbon composite fuselage, designed to make the twin-aisle aircraft lighter and cheaper to operate by burning less jet fuel. Qatar Airways also is one of the world&#39;s top operators of the aircraft. </p><p>In its statement, Qatar Airways said it had been monitoring the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft for some time. It described the issue as a “significant condition,” without elaborating.</p><p>“Following the explicit written instruction of its regulator, 13 aircraft have now been grounded, effectively removing them from service until such time as the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition,” the airline said in its statement. </p><p>Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. The airline has another on order with the Toulouse, France-based airplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 aircraft — the most of any airline worldwide. In June, Qatar Airways said it wouldn&#39;t take any more A350s unless the problem was fixed.</p><p>Airbus declined to specifically discuss Qatar Airways&#39; grounding.</p><p>“As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks / working with our customers,” a statement said. &#34;Those talks we keep confidential. We have no further comment on our customer’s operations.“ </p><p>Currently, Singapore Airlines is the world&#39;s top operator of the A350, with 56 now in its fleet. The airline did not respond to a request for comment. In America, Delta Air Lines has 15 in its fleet. The Atlanta-based carrier did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>The A350 has a list price as much as $366.5 million, though buyers often get discounts in bulk deals.</p><p>Qatar Airways CEO, Akbar al-Baker, is known for his hard-changing, confrontational approach in negotiating with manufacturers and others. </p><p>The airline will be the crucial carrier for fans attending the upcoming FIFA 2022 World Cup in this Arabian Peninsula country.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP. </p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/option-a-source-selection-statement-final.pdf" target="_blank">NASA’s selection of SpaceX’s Starship within the Human Lander System (HLS) program</a> was both surprising and exciting for space nerds all over. </p>



<p>Previously I have written about h<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/03/24/artemis-can-succeed-using-starship/" target="_blank">ow Starship’s ambitious approach could transform the Artemis Program</a>, particularly since <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/03/26/lunar-starship-and-unnecessary-operational-complexity/" target="_blank">Starship’s excessive cargo payload capacity</a> creates a lot of opportunities that were previously curtailed by the harsh reality of razor thin Lunar mass budgets. </p>



<p>As a rough rule of thumb, conventional approaches to Lunar transportation put cargo costs at upwards of $100m/T, while Starship should be able to get as low as $1m/T without any miracles, and perhaps as low as $100k/T long term. 100-1000 times cheaper transport costs is the sort of logistics improvement that creates possibilities, and much of my Twitter feed recently has been full of die hard space nerds coming to terms with this fact.</p>



<p>Of course, if Starship works it won’t be long until other companies and countries replicate its success – there’s nothing magical about it. So when we think of Starship right now we think of SpaceX’s prototypes blazing a trail on a south Texas beach, but long term we should think of it as any launch system that is big, ambitious, fully reusable, readily manufacturable, and above all cheap.</p>

<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does a Starship moon base look like?</p>— Casey Handmer, PhD (@CJHandmer) <a href="https://twitter.com/CJHandmer/status/1383853723256979457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Of course we’ve had these lovely renders from SpaceX over the last few years showing what a Moon base could physically look like but once the sci-fi elements are subtracted we’re left with the basics. A bunch of pressurized spaces covered in dirt.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>A Starship-enabled Lunar base is not some dismal single room tuna can like Jamestown Base from Season 1 of “For All Mankind”.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Jamestown Base from “For All Mankind”</figcaption></figure>



<p>After all, a single Starship could arrive with more pressurizable volume than the entire ISS and ~215 T of cargo. Instead, a Lunar base could look and feel more like McMurdo “Mactown” Station in Antarctica, the only Antarctic station with a ATM machine.</p>



<figure><figcaption>McMurdo Antarctic Station</figcaption></figure>



<p>Such a base would contain plenty of habitation volume to enable occupation without being cramped, dedicated facilities for sleeping, eating, working, and playing, logistics, transport, etc. Unlike a Mars city, it wouldn’t necessarily be oriented around the audacious goal of locally replicating a complete industrial stack, but it should be capable of comfortably housing more than a thousand astronauts at any one time, from any nation on Earth. </p>



<p>The habitations will necessarily be pressurized, meaning most likely vaults and cylinders with few sharp corners. They will also be covered in a layer of Moon dirt to provide protection from micrometeoroids, temperature swings, and cosmic radiation. Even so, there are ways that natural light could enter the structure, particularly because at the Lunar south pole the sun will never be more than a few degrees above (or below) the horizon. </p>



<p>In Lunar gravity (~0.16 g), roughly 9 meters of Moon dirt would be needed to counter a 0.5 bar working atmosphere, so <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/11/28/domes-are-very-over-rated/" target="_blank">some kind of tensile pressure-stabilized structure </a>could be employed to enclose large volumes, albeit without the transparent “open sky” permitted by Mars’ thin atmosphere.</p>



<p>But enough of architectural speculation (for now), let’s focus instead on the core of where the battle is won or lost: logistics. And in particular, electricity supply.</p>



<p>A reliable source of electricity is also a challenge for the Antarctic Stations, which generally use diesel generators and occasionally supplement with wind power. Antarctica is a cold, windy, and often very dark place. Indeed, when my wife Christine returned from her winter-over at the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station she did have a slight scent of diesel. Needless to say, getting diesel to the south pole is non-trivial, and in ages past it was flown in by C-130, though three gallons was burned for every gallon delivered. More recently, giant tractors haul it from McMurdo (which is generally supplied by ship) over the ice, taking several weeks to reach the pole. Still better than walking dragging a sledge, as the early explorers did.</p>



<p>Way back in the ancient times, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/reid2/" target="_blank">McMurdo even had a nuclear power plant</a>! Though after 8 years of sporadic operation the reactor, by then dubbed “Leaky Poo”, was dismantled and shipped back to the continental US along with 9000 cubic meters (!) of contaminated soil. </p>



<p>This is all a primer for the core problem: powering a station of any size on the Moon is non-trivial. </p>



<p>The first choice for space power, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, are challenged by the Moon’s long night. Over most of the Moon, the surface enjoys 14 days of uninterrupted sunlight followed by 14 days of night. During that time, another power source must be available to power station operations that can’t be arbitrarily shut off for 2 weeks. Indeed, environmental control (ECLSS) will have to provide heat during the cold winter night, in addition to atmospheric regulation, lighting, and a million other things. Due to the demands of ECLSS on the Moon, combined with a likely profusion of varying circadian cycles and shift work, I think it’s fair to assume that energy demand on the Moon will be much more regular than on Earth, where demand typically plunges by a factor of 3 or 4 at night.</p>



<p>As a back up system, batteries can work on Earth where nights are short, the air is breathable, and most people are asleep. On the Moon, for any given baseload demand, about 80 times as many batteries would be needed. And while the relative mass of batteries and solar panels doesn’t matter much on Earth where both are typically fixed to structures with copious static capacity, getting a bunch of heavy batteries to the Moon eats into payloads for other things.</p>



<p>One possible way around this problem is to build a base on a mountain at the South (or North) Pole, which due to the Moon’s low axial tilt enjoy much more sun than average, just as the adjacent craters are permanently shadowed regions (PSR) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/lunar-water-is-not-that-exciting/" target="_blank">contain some frozen mud</a>. These “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_of_eternal_light" target="_blank">peaks of eternal light</a>” are not quite eternal, however. There are multiple peaks and, particularly during the Lunar winter, they tend to eclipse each other. Even the prime locations on or near the rim of Shackleton Crater endure nights as long as 7 days with shorter periods of darkness during the daily cycle. This is a factor of 2 improvement over the generic case anywhere in the non-polar Lunar regions, but it’s still a huge challenge.</p>



<p>To put this into concrete terms, space-rated solar panels are routinely made incredibly thin and as light as 50 grams per square meter – similar to a sheet of newspaper. If the entire 200 T payload of a Starship was consumed with solar panels, they could produce a peak of 800 MW, assuming 20% efficiency. This is enough power for a small city on Earth.</p>



<p>In contrast, really good lithium-ion batteries can achieve about 100 kWh/T, so a 200 T payload of batteries would store 20 MWh. Attached to the solar panels they could charge completely in about 90 seconds, and after night falls, at the same power draw, would discharge in the same period. 90 seconds is a lot less than 7 days. </p>



<p>Alternatively, if 20 MWh had to last for 7 days, then average power draw would be 120 kW, about the same as the ISS. The panels necessary to provide this would weigh just 60 kg, a rounding error on the total payload.</p>



<p>Arguably overnight power storage could be accomplished by electrolysing Lunar water, then capturing the exhaust from fuel cells. Even using Lunar water, the mass of the cells, condensers, electrolysers, power electronics, storage tanks, and heat exchangers is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio#Fuel_cell_stacks_and_flow_cell_batteries" target="_blank">comparable a Lithium-ion battery</a>, while the round trip efficiency is much lower. And that’s not even including the mass overhead for mining lunar water! For the sake of argument, say a closed cycle Hydrogen energy storage system achieves 1 MWh/T. In this case, the above scenario results in power loss after 900 seconds, or 15 minutes. Still a lot less than 7 days.</p>



<p>One potential approach is to position solar panels in a number of carefully chosen locations around the rim of Shackleton crater and to wire them together, such that at any given time most of them are in sunlight. On the plus side this reduces the odds of a power outage. On the minus side it requires building solar farms many kilometers apart, linking them up with improbably robust, cheap, and light electrical cable that won’t break down due to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank">Paschen’s Law</a>, and doing it all before the winter arrives.</p>



<p>I also looked into mounting solar panels on a very tall tower, similar to a radio mast. These are strong, light, and tall, so perhaps there was some trade between aluminium tower sections and panels that could put the panels high enough that they’d never be shaded, even in the depths of Lunar winter, and thus avoid more batteries than the 2 hours or so necessary to endure a Lunar eclipse.</p>



<p>Indeed, the global trade looks like this.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Diagram showing three way trade between solar power towers, panels, and batteries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, it turns out that the minimum altitude necessary to avoid any shading is 2750 m, rather taller than any structure ever built on Earth. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Left: Map of the Lunar south pole showing minimum altitude of shade-free space above any given point. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since I believe powering a Lunar base should be less exciting than exceeding previous antenna height records by a factor of four, there must be a better way.</p>



<p>The lunar surface is subjected to large temperature fluctuations. During the day, it can reach 127 C while at night it can plunge as low as -173 C, a total range of 300 C. In the PSRs it can be even colder, as low as -185 C. </p>



<p>In the lunar south pole region, a heat exchanger system between radiators positioned in shaded regions (even artificially shaded regions, such as in a pit surrounded by MLI) and absorbers placed in sunny regions could produce energy with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(thermodynamics)" target="_blank">Carnot efficiency</a> approaching 75%! Running the working fluid through a (very) large ice bath could ensure energy storage through the dark nights when the absorbers would be shaded. </p>



<p>To maintain a baseline power supply of 1 MW, a large supply of water could be converted to ice, generating 2200 kJ/kg from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion" target="_blank">latent heat of fusion</a>. There is little marginal benefit to preheating the water to near boiling or chilling the ice to lower temperatures. The total volume required is about 12,500 T, or 5 Olympic swimming pools. By comparison, *only* 2000 T of batteries would be required to do the same job, or a mere 10 dedicated Starship flights. So locally procured water would need to be found in vast, easy to access quantities. Still, having 10,000 T of thermal mass floating around is never a bad idea.</p>



<p>The coolant loop, operating between 100 K and 400 K would need something like pressurized supercritical ethane. Unfortunately a gravity fed heat pipe would be upside down in this case. I don’t know much about refrigerants, but using ethane as an example, it has a heat capacity of 2.28 kJ/kg K, or 684 kJ/kg over the 300 K temperature variation. At 75% Carnot efficiency, the coolant loop would need to move 2 kg/s to produce 1 MW of power. With a 16 cm (6.5″) diameter buried pipe and a flow rate of 1 m/s, the fluid would have to move about 5 km to transition between shaded and mostly sunny areas, for a total length of 10 km and a total fluid volume of 200 cubic meters, or roughly 200 T, just for coolant. (Or somewhat less if artificial PSRs can be constructed in a more convenient location).</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poiseuille’s Law</a> enables an estimate of total pumping power at around 25 W for this point design.</p>



<p>Solar heating is fine but what if there was a more reliable way to provide the heat source fed to radiators in the PSRs? Some kind of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/2115/" target="_blank">magical metal that just emits thermal energy</a>? And a stream of neutrons. A scaled up (or multiple) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilopower" target="_blank">Kilopower reactor</a> could deliver 1 MW of baseline power with less than 150 T of total mass, including 4 T of Uranium. Assembled in any convenient PSR, a nuclear reactor could supply power indefinitely, regardless of lunar phase. Indeed, if used away from polar regions they may be unable to provide much power during the day, due to the difficulty of radiating heat in direct sunlight. It turns out the Sun is also a nuclear reactor and it’s much bigger and hotter. And unlike Lunar water, refining Lunar uranium is probably easier than getting a launch permit for it.</p>



<p>The final crazy idea I’ll consider here is a variation on the space-based solar power trope. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/space-based-solar-power-is-not-a-thing/" target="_blank">I have written more than once about how silly this idea is</a>, but at its core is a concept that may finally have its day: remotely beamed microwave power. </p>



<p>Like peaks of eternal light, there are numerous places on the surface of the Moon, including close to polar regions, that are always in view of Earth. Indeed, anywhere on the Moon’s terminator there are places where the Earth appears to rise and set every few weeks.</p>

<p>Microwave antennas positioned here could receive power beamed up from the surface of the Earth from one of at least three stations such that one is always in view. </p>



<p>A 1 MW baseline could be safely transmitted at a power density of 100 W/m^2, implying a receiving area of about 200 m in width, once beam losses and conversion losses are taken into account. Achieving a beam that narrow (1/2000000 rad) from the Earth would require a phased array spaced out over a much larger area, at least 200 km at 5 Ghz (6cm). Each element of the phased array is a high power gyrotron with a steerable high gain antenna phase locked to a carrier transmitted from the Moon. </p>



<p>The advantages of this approach include the low cost of the surface infrastructure on the Moon and its relatively low complexity scaling. Increasing the power requires adding more gyrotrons to each transmitting site on Earth, which is much simpler than commissioning new nuclear power plants in places so cold that conventional metals used for robots get brittle. </p>



<p>The main disadvantage is that such an array is also a very effective anti-satellite weapon and could cause proliferation concerns. </p>



<p>Starship opens up the possibility of building a large, permanently occupied Lunar base. With this comes the unexpected but ultimate pleasant challenge of ensuring the base is adequately supplied with the electricity it needs to run its systems, no questions asked. How would you approach this problem?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Accurate description of effects is not hair-splitting; it is much-needed exactness to avoid adding confusion to an extraordinarily complicated and tense scientific and societal debate around COVID-19 vaccines.  </p><p>It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine—a general misconception of vaccine protection also found in a <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> Editorial.</p></blockquote><p>This <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X.pdf">appeared</a> in correspondence in a March 8th publication through The Lancet, a leading peer reviewed medical journal. It emphasizes that even within the scientific communities focused on such issues, misunderstandings about the meaning and implications of reported numbers about vaccine efficacy persist. If the scientific community makes a mistake in its own interpretations, that can misinform policy makers, even very educated ones, and that in turn can misinform the public. </p><p>In the last few weeks I have seen evidence of articles more widely shared to correct some of the early misconceptions The Lancet correspondence was concerned about. However a more insidious form of misunderstanding and misinformation lingers, and is pervasive.</p><p>Tom is no ordinary doctor. He is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Frieden">former Director of the Center for Disease  Control</a> under President Barack Obama. He is also propagating dangerous misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. It will cause people to misunderstand the real world results which can cause more people to die, and exacerbate the pandemic.</p><p>Dr. Tom is wrong. About as wrong you can get. The real world data has shown that the death rate among the <strong>vaccinated</strong>, if infected with COVID, can be <em>3 to 5.7 times higher<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></em> than the death rate of the <strong>unvaccinated</strong>. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F629586ca-fce4-4549-ba0d-faddd88c6974_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The former Director of the CDC is making what I call an Acceptable Catastrophic Error. This is the kind of error one is allowed to make when they are perceived to have the correct opinion. Arguments and statistics used towards the goal of getting every single person vaccinated for COVID are given far less scrutiny and are accepted as true more readily, than any arguments or statistics that might be perceived as counterproductive towards that goal.</p><p>When the former Director of the CDC, or anyone else for that matter, says someone who is infected with COVID is 100 times less likely to die if they have been vaccinated, it does not matter how far off that number is. It will be readily forgiven no matter how inaccurate. It is the goal of universal vaccination, not truth, that appears to be most important. </p><p>There are a lot of acceptable catastrophic errors.</p><h2>Vaccine Efficacy</h2><p>In order to understand why people are claiming these marvelous additional benefits exist, we will unfortunately have to do some math. But once we do, confusion will be alleviated, and the dangerous misinformation being spread by those in authority and those on a mission to convince everyone to get vaccinated, will become clear.</p><p>To understand vaccine efficacy, a diagram provided in the results of a Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2 <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577">clinical trial</a> will be very useful.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44e4f717-c79a-413f-869e-c25d2b4d4d70_751x735.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>The red line with circles shows that for those who received the vaccine, which was 21,669 people, the rate of infection slowed. The average number of days between individual infections increased. The result is that over a period of time, the total number of people who became infected was indeed far lower than the unvaccinated group.</p><p>This is where the earlier statement from from The Lancet “who would have become diseased with COVID-19 had they not been vaccinated” comes into play. It is reasonably assumed that the red line would resemble the blue line if the group were unvaccinated. Therefore one could count the number of squares on the blue line that occur in between instances of red circles, and get a ratio of how many unvaccinated people got infected per each vaccinated person over a period of time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0651462-bd31-47be-9354-69a52038b6bb_1797x369.png"></a></figure></div><p>The efficacy rating (VE in the table) is a way of trying to do this. However one additional layer of complexity is added. Researchers treat the people in study without much distinction. Every day that a person is included in the study and observable is considered a person-day. Every person being observed on a given day is counted and added to a tally of person-days. At the end of the study, the observed infections are divided by the total person-days counted for the group.</p><p>For example, if two people are observed across four days, it is a total of eight person-days. Each person has a chance of infection each day, unless they were already infected. It makes a total of eight chances for a person to become infected. However, once infected, someone cannot be infected again, so that person stops being counted in the person-day tally. In this particular case they used a different length of time than day, but the idea is the same.</p><p>At the end of the day, the efficacy calculation is the result of <em>counting things and dividing things counted</em>. We can take the numbers they counted and divide them ourselves to arrive at the same efficacy numbers. Let’s use the data from <strong>≥ 7 days after dose 2</strong>. We have 21,314 people across 4.015 time units for the vaccinated group, and 21,258 people across 3.982 time units for the unvaccinated. Now we compare the rates of infection, which were 9 and 172 observed infections respectively.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe3c9b01-9824-471d-9745-47e29acfcd46_619x194.gif"></a></figure></div><p>Finally, we take the two rates, and compare them, and compute a number that represents the percent score called <em>efficacy</em>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa986b15b-a0ef-4bb7-bfbe-2dda97b17dec_365x60.gif"></a></figure></div><p>There is the efficacy number from the table. Subtracting from 1 simply allows you to report a number where higher is better, instead of using “golf rules” where lower is better. The calculation itself is not misleading if you understand how it is derived. But it is important to hold on to the idea we are currently talking about<em> <strong>infection rates over time</strong></em><strong> </strong>only. It is perfectly reasonable to compare infection rates among two groups in this way.</p><blockquote><p>This distinction is all the more important as, although we know the risk reduction achieved by these vaccines under trial conditions, we do not know whether and how it could vary if the vaccines were deployed on populations with different exposures, transmission levels, and attack rates.<a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></p></blockquote><h2>Real populations</h2><p>Israel offered a glimpse into the real world dynamics of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. A major <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext#%20">study</a>, published May 2021 in The Lancet, reviewed national surveillance data, collected as part of a government vaccination initiative. The data collected was able to identify those vaccinated on which dates; when they were diagnosed with COVID; whether they were symptomatic or not; if and when they went to the hospital; if they had severe or critical hospitalization; and if they died.</p><p>The study is quite thorough, although it did contain <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(21)01555-5.pdf">errors</a> some of which may not have been fully corrected. But we can jump directly to inspecting the efficacy numbers and correcting errors. We will be using the numbers provided in Table 4 on page 1825. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad58bfbd-de08-41ec-b52c-00252bb6b04b_1889x2025.png"></a></figure></div><p>The top white box contains the number of infections observed during the study. We can use <strong>All Ages</strong>. The <strong>Unvaccinated</strong> and <strong>Vaccinated</strong> infections for <strong>All Ages</strong> were 109,876 and 3,642 respectively. Just as before, we need the person-days (the total time observed) for both. These are provided at the bottom of the table and for the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated they are 120,076,136 and 170,434,659 respectively. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc78687fb-fbe9-4b62-a766-bb73f2e6a3b5_426x146.gif"></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f5ab5b-2892-4730-93e6-93091f394e21_1805x449.png"></a></figure></div><p>Taking a look at our approximate ratios calculated, you can see that 91.5 in the red square in the table corresponds to our calculated unvaccinated rate, and similarly 2.1 in the blue box corresponds to our calculated vaccinated rate. We would simply need to multiply both by 100,000, as they are <strong>incidence rates</strong> per 100,000 person-days, to make them about equal to the table.</p><p>The next step is identical to the Pfizer phase three trial. “Vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as (1 – IRR) × 100” (<strong>Incidence Rate Ratios</strong>, IRR)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafde1366-9cdf-46b2-a6fb-dbd810da564d_414x83.png"></a></figure></div><p>Our calculation appears to be 1.1% higher than that in the table. There are two possible explanations. One explanation may be that when they <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(21)01555-5.pdf">corrected</a> some hard values they failed to update the efficacy calculation. The second explanation is that the authors ran the raw data, which we do not have, through a particular statistical package<a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a> in order to estimate the bounds (numbers in parentheses, giving some wiggle room to the estimate), which gave them a more nuanced estimate for the central incidence rates than the numbers they provide the reader allow — as our calculated incidence rates are clearly in agreement with the table.</p><p>This isn’t too important, as these are simply estimates the authors are making based on observations. These estimates will change over time and with different populations. They are very useful to have, but should not be treated as if they’re exact.</p><p>They are also not where the major issues arise. One can simply look at the raw numbers without calculating the efficacy number and conclude that indeed, infection rates were substantially lower. The differences that remain in their calculation for efficacy percentage are negligible.</p><p>Next, however, we move to what will ultimately be the source of misinformation. It isn’t the fault of the report itself, but a consequence of too many people who pretend to speak from knowledge and authority interpreting numbers they do not understand.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h2>Vaccine Efficacy “against death”</h2><p>Included in the study are rates of symptomatic COVID, hospitalization, severe hospitalization, and their respective efficacy calculations.

That’s 100% protection against death! Those between the ages 16-44 <em>cannot die</em> from COVID! You can see how impossible it is for someone to die if vaccinated, as they do not even provide a range of uncertainty. 100% with no uncertainty is as <em>certain</em> as you can get.</p><h2>The Fatal Flaw (pun intended)</h2><p>It is obviously possible for vaccinated people 16-44 to die from COVID. The other results from this efficacy from death calculation are <em>just as flawed</em>, and are being dangerously misused. Let us revisit Dr. Tom, the former CDC director.</p><p>Hyper-vigilant mass-vaccination advocates have been using the vaccine efficacy “from death” numbers in this Israeli study to claim that <em><strong>if you get COVID</strong></em> you have additional protection because of the vaccine. Some may quote the percentage (“it’s 96% effective at preventing death!”) so as to not be accused of inventing their own numbers. But if you have made it this far, you have performed the efficacy calculation three separate times now. <em>Counting things and dividing things counted</em>.</p><p>Nowhere, at any time, in any way, did we look at how many people in the vaccinated group <em>got</em> COVID <em>and</em> died. We (and the authors of the study) counted the number of deaths among the vaccinated, and divide by the number of <em>days, </em>not the number of <em>infections</em>.</p><p>And if we do actually look at and compare deaths among those actually infected we get a completely different story.</p><h2>The efficacy numbers <em>are</em> misinformation</h2><p>Every single additional efficacy number is redundant. All reported results downstream from infection are a <em>consequence</em> of reduced infections<a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>. The efficacy rates would all be in the high 90s even if the vaccinated group were <em>perfectly identical</em> except for infection rate.</p><p>When “former Director of the CDC” Dr. Tom and others use the non-infection efficacy numbers to discuss the vaccines, they are, intentionally or not, misleading the public. It is something that should end immediately.</p><p>With the exception of infection rates, the efficacy numbers convey no useful information to citizens about their risks once they have been vaccinated. Instead, it may cause the vaccinated to place themselves and others at greater risk if they operate on this misinformation.</p><p>The efficacy numbers, other than infection, which are all <strong>downstream effects</strong> of infection, are being used and accepted as if they are additional, layered benefits at every stage of COVID infection.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17759fe4-6a7c-400a-b53c-7c4f7898f97c_752x96.png"></a></figure></div><p>This diagram is how they are being communicated and how they are being received by the clear majority of public figures and citizens.

It is hard to fathom how much more wrong someone could be yet still maintain their credibility after this. But because these are <em>acceptable</em> catastrophic errors, if I am successful in clearing up confusion, those spreading the misinformation will simply move on to the next acceptable catastrophic error.</p><h2>What the numbers really showed</h2><p>When you actually take a look at who was infected and who died by age group, the idea of additional protection disappears for most.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c313439-a098-4089-a54c-f9b8bd4f8027_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>When you are finally <em>counting things and dividing things counted</em> which matter, such as how many infected people went on to die in each group, no remnant of the 90% numbers remain.

Because it was looking at rates over time, 24 deaths would have been the death rate over time similar to 36 in the unvaccinated group. But clearly, among those infected, 36 in 84611 is a far lower death rate than 24 in 1066! </p><p>The death rate for the ages 16-44 among infected would need to have been almost <em>53 times higher </em>to report the vaccine was 3% effective at <em>preventing</em> death.</p><h3>More graphs</h3><p>Let’s look at some other situations. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F914eb1e1-1bde-4ed1-badd-593179ca17bc_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faffec51a-8724-437b-88d4-3cc536d2fe8d_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><p>For ages 45-64, there again isn’t enough evidence to conclude that the infection/case fatality rate is any different, but as the bluish dots indicate, the numbers we have actually lean towards a <em>higher</em> death rate among the vaccinated.</p><p>The silver lining though is that among those 65 and over, the observed death rate in the trial gives us decent reason to believe that <em>maybe </em>the vaccine can reduce the death rate for this group. Since they were the most vulnerable all along, this is a promising result.</p><h2>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</h2><p>If you were to notice that a number of people died after vaccination, and inferred that the vaccine must have <em>caused</em> the death, you would be committing what is known as the “post hoc ergo propter hoc” fallacy. </p><p>This is a simple enough fallacy to explain. Just because B happened after A does not mean B was <em>caused</em> by A. Causation requires more knowledge to deduce.</p><p>If you were to commit this fallacy communicating concern over vaccination you would be quickly told by pro-mass-vaccination advocates of this flaw in reasoning. However the same error is committed by the pro-mass-vaccination crowd without any internal pressure checking the reasoning. </p><p>We have great reason to assert a causal relationship between decreased infection rates and vaccination. The mRNA vaccines were designed to have a causal mechanism of interaction. Observing the intended effects of the causal mechanism on the macro level (fewer infections) is reasonable to attribute to the engineered mechanism on the micro level.</p><p>We have far less reason to assert causation <em>downstream</em> from preventing infection. The pro-vaccinate-everyone crowd has used their incorrect understanding of how the efficacy numbers were derived, and made post hoc ergo propter hoc arguments with them. Even when the data does not show <em>any </em>difference, a misreading and misunderstanding of efficacy numbers is automatically combined with post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, compounding errors.</p><p>These are all <strong>Acceptable Catastrophic Errors</strong>, unfortunately.</p><h2>The dangers of efficacy misinformation</h2><p>On any given day on social media, you can find someone who has been vaccinated saying they contracted COVID, and they just <em>know</em> that but for the vaccine they would have been in worse shape. These announcement get shared widely. It is wonderful that people have avoided some of the worst symptoms, but the data has not supported the observation that the vaccine offers significant downstream benefits for most people.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafe832f3-b984-455a-ad12-28fd8b2b2970_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><p>The repetition of this false idea, that there are amazing and significant additional benefits outside of mere reduced infection rates, will result in people taking increased risks.</p><p>The person who <em>incorrectly</em> assumes that “with the vaccine, <em>even if I get infected</em> I am less likely to die than I would be without the vaccine,” will be more likely to engage in behavior that risks infection. They may become the “it’s just a flu bro” of the vaccinated.</p><p>If the lack of observed layered protection were made more explicit then people may choose to still wear masks and social distance, to further reduce their exposure in addition to vaccination. They may choose to go to fewer social events. This in turn would reduce the infection rate, and reduce the probability a mutation that evades vaccination finds a host to practice on. (While writing this article, the White House <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/cdc-guidance-fallout-house-white-house-bring-back-mask-mandates">changed its masking recommendation</a> for the vaccinated)</p><p>Those who strongly believe everyone should get vaccinated may still choose to promote the efficacy numbers as additional layers of protection, because their goal is to encourage people to get vaccinated. Misleading use of numbers in advertising is a tale as old as time. But they are doing so at the cost of both their honesty and integrity, and sacrificing some of the actual benefits that vaccination provides, by giving people incorrect information to base their choices on.</p><p>Those who like to say “the numbers speak for themselves” are the least likely to understand what the numbers are saying. The studies that make epidemiological assessments are reporting to a different audience than the numbers reported are being presented to. To the extent that some studies may exist where these values are calculated conditionally, they are incompatible with the ones that have been computed unconditionally. This information is unlikely to be contained in the spreading of these numbers, as they are more often going to be used interchangeably.</p><h3>The wrong audience</h3><p>A hospital trying to plan resources and staffing cares about the estimated daily hospitalization and death rate given how many people are vaccinated. A policy maker deciding among options to fight coronavirus, cares what the daily rates are for various metrics after a policy is adopted.</p><p>An individual, for the most part, does not care about the daily rate in the population. They care what their <em>own</em> odds, or those of their loved ones, are. </p><p>It does not matter to an individual if the daily observed rate of infection is low across all people, if they <em>themselves</em> are at significantly higher risk. However, absent other measures that can guide an individual risk assessment, a report of daily infection rates if vaccinated compared to unvaccinated does give someone a useful measure at the level of making the choice to get vaccinated.</p><p>But once an individual becomes vaccinated, the daily rate of hospitalization, or the daily rate of death, is meaningless. Except in the extremes, such as a resources being exhausted, the daily rate of death has zero relationship to an individual’s chances of death once infected. The individual needs to know their probabilities if they ultimately become infected.</p><p>At the beginning of this article I teased that the data show that death rate among the vaccinated and infected is higher than that of the unvaccinated and infected. This is true for death and also true for hospitalization.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc34bb30-d84d-497a-b09c-dc74872e3473_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94eadcad-1131-4b9d-bcae-4c5514fbfa5e_1061x241.png"></a></figure></div><p>There is no sleight of hand or trickery involved.

In the UK, which is tracking variants, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf">reports</a> that among Delta variant cases, those vaccinated with two doses died at a rate of 0.0078 per infection and those unvaccinated died at a rate of 0.0014 per infection. The death per infection was <strong>5.7 times higher</strong> among the vaccinated.</p><p>Without careful control and understanding, one might erroneously conclude the Delta variant is is more lethal if you’ve been vaccinated, the vaccine is losing its efficacy, the vaccination is making people weaker, or some combination. While any of those are possible outcomes in this environment, by not being aware of the infection death rate issue from the start, because one is busy spreading misinformation about extra levels of protection that the data do not support, one misses how to properly control for these effects and analyze new data as it comes in.</p><p>The death rate if infected was always going to be higher in the vaccinated groups if most of the vaccinated were those likely to die in the first place. </p><h3>Those darn Acceptable Catastrophic Errors</h3><p>Some people may simply shrug when this issue is pointed out to them. Some who understood at a casual level the that efficacy measures were rates over time, may simply not understand the big deal about using them to promote the vaccines. To some degree the vaccines change the probability someone who takes them will wind up dead from COVID. Is it really a big deal that the numbers are all double, triple, and quadruple counting decreased infections as additional benefits downstream? Is it really a problem if you tell a person they’ll be 100 times less likely to die if they get COVID and are vaccinated if that convinces them to get vaccinated?</p><p>Yes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Benjamin Banneker’s Broods of Cicadas</title>
      <link>https://www.historytoday.com/archive/natural-histories/benjamin-bannekers-broods-cicadas</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <section>
          
            <div><p>In the spring of 1749 Benjamin Banneker – the 17-year-old son of a freed slave – thought the world was about to be eaten whole. While working on his family’s farm in Oella, Maryland, he saw ‘thousands of locusts’ suddenly rise up from the ground and ‘creep …up the trees and bushes’, as if directed by some unseen hand. Fearing that they had come to ‘eat and destroy the fruit of the Earth, and would occasion a famine in the land’, he set about killing them as quickly as he could. But he soon realised it was pointless. There were just too many of them. Helpless, he waited with trepidation for the destruction to begin. Yet it never came and within a matter of weeks the ‘locusts’ had vanished without trace. </p>
<p>What Banneker thought were ‘locusts’ turned out to be a species of periodical cicadas (<i>Magicicada</i>) and what he had seen was just one of several gigantic ‘broods’ native to North America (Brood X). Like their European counterparts, periodical cicadas spend the vast majority of their lives underground as immature nymphs. Secreted in burrows, they feed off the xylem found in roots and generally don’t cause any bother. Once every 13 or 17 years (depending on the brood), when the temperature of the soil is just right – usually in late April or May – they clamber upwards <i>en masse</i>. When they reach the surface, they shed their outer skin and assume their adult, winged, form. The mating ritual then begins. Gathering together in ‘choruses’, the males make a high-pitched clicking sound to attract females; and for the next few weeks they reproduce with proverbial enthusiasm. Yet as soon as they have laid their eggs in the bark of trees they die, leaving their young to hide until the next great awakening. </p>
<p>Banneker was not the first person to see periodical cicadas in North America, of course. Sightings had been reported in 1633 [1634], 1666 and 1675, and brief descriptions of the insect’s life cycle had been published by Andreas Sandel and the botanist John Bartram in 1715 and 1737. Nor was Banneker the only person to remark on the 1749 emergence. Peter Kalm, a Swedish naturalist, witnessed the same brood while visiting Pennsylvania. He, too, would write a study of the cicada’s habits, albeit hedged about with caveats. But Banneker’s encounter was nevertheless to prove vital to our understanding of the cicada’s periodicity – and would mark the beginning of one of the most remarkable, if overlooked, scientific careers of the American Enlightenment. </p>

<h3><b>Auspicious return</b></h3>
<p>Banneker was born on 9 November 1731, the son of Robert and Mary Bannaka (or Bannaky). In surviving documents, Mary is described as a ‘free black’, and is most likely to have been the daughter of a black slave and a white indentured servant. Robert, by contrast, was a freed slave. Like so many others, he had been taken from Guinea and forcibly transported to Maryland to work on the tobacco plantations that were the mainstay of the colonial economy. How long he was kept in this condition is unclear, but he was fortunate to be granted his freedom just before the British authorities introduced measures to prevent slave-owners from manumitting their slaves without the legislature’s permission. </p>
<p>Despite Robert and Mary’s background, the Bannekers were moderately prosperous. In 1737, when Benjamin was six, his father purchased 100 acres of land in exchange for 7,000 lbs of tobacco and the family built a small log cabin, which stands to this day. Benjamin received little formal education. He is likely to have learned the rudiments of reading and writing from his grandmother, Molly Welsh; but whether he went on to attend a local school is unclear. If he did, it cannot have been for long. </p>
<p>Benjamin had a hunger for learning, though. Anything to do with the natural world fascinated him and his encounter with the cicadas in 1749 seems to have been instrumental in persuading him to cultivate his interest seriously. Judging by his later account, his scientific instincts were already well developed. He not only had a keen eye, but also formulated a sensible (if mistaken) hypothesis about the cicadas’ environmental impact. He even appears to have suspected that their immense numbers were key to their survival. Most tellingly, he also made a mental note not to forget what he had seen and to determine by observation when they would return. </p>
<p>From that moment on, patterns and periodicity would be an abiding preoccupation. Four years later, he tried his hand at clock-making. Captivated by the rapid pace of technological change, or – more likely – drawn to the oft-cited analogy between watchmaking and the workings of nature, he built a wooden clock of his own by copying the mechanism of a pocket watch he borrowed from a wealthy friend. For a young man with little, if any, experience of timepieces, it was nothing short of remarkable. </p>

</figure>

<p>His learning was, at this stage, very much of a practical bent. Driven by curiosity, he proceeded by trial and error whenever he had a free moment. By necessity, his progress was halting and uncertain – more so after his father’s death in 1759 obliged him to assume responsibility as head of the household. But his enquiring mind continued to whir and, when the cicadas returned in 1766, he was no longer the wide-eyed <i>naïf </i>of 17 years before. This time he ‘had more sense than to endeavour to destroy them, knowing they were not so pernicious to the fruit of the Earth as I did imagine they would be’. And, being less afraid, he was able to observe them closely – more closely, in fact, than many other scientists who witnessed their appearance at the same time. For, while they were generally content to study a single resurgence and guess at their periodicity on the basis of hearsay, Banneker seems already to have realised that the only way to establish the length of their cycle for certain was to watch them over a much longer period. </p>
<p>The cicadas’ return proved auspicious. Six years after he watched them rise up in clouds from the ground, three brothers – Andrew, John, and Joseph Ellicott – bought some land not far from Banneker’s farm. Unlike most Marylanders, who were Catholic, the Ellicotts were Quakers and had little time for racial prejudices. They quickly struck up a friendship with their neighbour and, on learning that Banneker shared their passion for science, gladly lent him books with which to further his studies. </p>

<h3><b>Calculating cicadas</b></h3>
<p>Little is known of Banneker’s life in the following decades. Nothing has survived to indicate how he was affected by the Revolutionary War. But by the time the cicadas came back for a third time in 1783, just a few months before the conflict ended, Banneker had made striking progress in all his studies – and was well placed to capitalise on his talents under the new Republic. Some five years later he began studying astronomy intensively and was sufficiently skilled in mathematics that he could calculate the tides and a host of other phenomena. </p>
<p>In spring 1791 Major Andrew Ellicott – the son of Banneker’s neighbour, Joseph – was asked by Thomas Jefferson, then the Secretary of State, to survey the area earmarked for the new federal capital and he immediately invited Banneker to join his team. The extent of Banneker’s contribution to this project has, admittedly, been much debated. The evidence is ambiguous at best. But whatever his role, the mere fact of his involvement is eloquent testimony to the esteem in which his learning was beginning to be held. </p>
<p>After leaving the surveying expedition, Banneker concentrated on preparing an almanac and ephemeris for the year 1792. This contained exhaustive tables detailing ‘the Motions of the Sun and Moon, the … Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun … Age of the Moon … Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgement of the Weather’ and countless other wonders, all calculated by hand, using a series of self-derived (and remarkably complex) formulae. He showed this to his old friend Andrew Ellicott, who was so impressed that he sent it to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. Pemberton had it checked by an astronomer and, on being assured of its ‘extraordinary’ accuracy, arranged for it to be published. It met with immediate success – so much so that Banneker prepared several more editions in the years which followed. </p>
<p>At about the same time, Banneker also became committed to securing justice for African Americans. Perhaps encouraged by the Ellicotts, he wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who, in addition to being the Secretary of State, was also compromised by his involvement in the slave trade. Though he repeatedly condemned the institution of slavery, and once boasted that he wanted his slaves always to be well treated, he did not hesitate to order violent floggings and fathered six children by a slave girl. Much to Banneker’s chagrin, he also viewed slaves as being of inferior intelligence – although whether this was due to nature or nurture, he could not say. Banneker forcefully took Jefferson to task for his hypocrisy. Vilifying the Secretary for ‘detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression’, he demanded radical change. </p>
<p>Jefferson’s reply was courteous, if evasive. Perhaps stung by Banneker’s criticisms, he confined himself to vague wishes for some improvement in slaves’ living conditions. Later that same day, however, he sent a copy of Banneker’s almanac to the Marquis de Condorcet, accompanied by a note extolling his mathematical genius and hoping that such ‘eminence’ would be ‘so multiplied as to prove’ the intellectual equality of all men. </p>

<h3><b>Rising again</b></h3>
<p>Astronomy and mathematics remained Banneker’s principal interests, however, and he did not hesitate to bring them to bear on his study of the cicadas. At some point around the time he wrote to Jefferson, he compiled all the data he had so far accumulated in a note, inscribed in his ‘Astronomical Journal’. It was not long, but it was as detailed and comprehensive an account as anyone had yet written and represented the fruits of almost 50 years of study. Most important of all, it also included a prediction. Rejecting the hearsay and supposition favoured by most other scientists in favour of his past observations, he wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>They may be expected again in the year 1800, which is Seventeen years since their last appearance to me. So that if I may venture So to express it, their periodical return is Seventeen years, but they, like the Comets, make but a short stay with us … [Yet] if their lives are Short, they are merry, they begin to Sing of make a noise from the first they come out of the Earth till they die.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon proved right, Banneker’s prediction was of huge value. It established beyond doubt that Brood X followed a 17-year cycle and allowed farmers throughout the eastern United States to prepare appropriately, saving needless effort and no end of worry. </p>
<p>Seduced by the music of the stars as much as by the singing of cicadas, Banneker continued searching for patterns in nature until his death, nine years later, at the age of 78. Many of his papers were lost in a fire shortly afterwards; and, in the decades which followed, his work was largely overlooked. Thankfully, the record has recently begun to be set right, but there is still a long way to go. Given that Brood X returned only a few weeks ago – just as Banneker suggested it would – this is the perfect time to give this most remarkable of men the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of American science and justice. </p>

(PCAPs available on request. Actually did the test with a local server
of mine. But it should be easy to reproduce, be it with any Linux
distribution.)

I did this test with Lynx from Debian Experimental (which has the
current Lynx upstream release 2.9.0dev.8) as well as with Lynx from
Debian 8 Jessie ELTS (which has Lynx 2.8.9dev.1) and both leak the
password via SNI. I though assume that older releases of Lynx are
probably also affected as well, at least if they or the according
crypto libraries support SNI.

But given that the symptoms Thorsten discovered stayed unreported for
quite some years, I assume that this use case is a rather seldom one.
Nevertheless only trying to use Lynx that way (and seeing it fail)
already leaks the used password.

IMHO this nevertheless needs a CVE-ID.

Cc&#39;ing Debian Security Team as well as the OSS Security mailing list
for making them aware of this issue. I also updated the subject of
this thread to make it less ambigous on other mailing lists.

And I&#39;m also Cc&#39;ing the according Debian bug report which I created
for tracking this issue in Debian: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/991971" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.debian.org/991971</a>

These projects use events only a carrier can get. We process millions of minutes of phone conversations per week, growing about 25% Month over month.</p>
<p>We build modern landlines for businesses and families.</p>

<ul>
<li>Help maintaining Django services that touch interfaces in telecom (T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, CLECs)</li>
<li>Drive best practices and architecture design</li>
<li>Help design APIs so existing apps (like CRMs) can use voice and message data</li>
<li>Ultimately, design a system to learn and change a business’s call flow to optimize for e-commerce goals like order creation</li>
<li>Understanding that the value of what we create is in how it’s used by our staff or customers. Not simply the technological contribution</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You are highly curious and almost fearless when it comes to writing software and bringing organization to the wild west of old school carriers and cable companies... someone who wants to find out what is really going on and wants to make a huge impact.</li>
<li>You know what it means to join a fast-growing startup</li>
</ul>
</div></div><h2><strong>Why you should join Community Phone Company</strong></h2><div><div><p>Community Phone Company YC W19 built a simple cloud phone system for businesses that don&#39;t operate a call center.</p>
<p>Our solution lets a business get all modern voice features (re-route if busy, greeting menu and IVR, programmable caller ID, cloud voicemail, etc) on their existing office phone and existing employee cell phones. All employees onboard instantly, no wifi required, no app to download. Businesses should not be missing out on orders because they can only take one call at a time, and they shouldn&#39;t need an IT person in order to get a modern business phone system.</p>

His business – importing woven shoes from Guangzhou, China, to sell in the northern city of Kano and his home state of Abia, further south – had been suffering along with the country’s economy. The ban threatened to tip it over the edge. “It was a serious crisis: I had to act fast,” Awa says.</span></p><p>He turned to his younger brother, Osy, who had begun trading bitcoins. “He was just accumulating, accumulating crypto, saying that at some point years down the line it could be a great investment. When the forex ban happened, he showed me how much I needed it, too. I could pay my suppliers in bitcoins if they accepted – and they did.”</p><p>According to bitcoin trading platform <a href="https://paxful.com/blog/free-internal-transfer-nigeria/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Paxful</a>, Nigeria is now second only to the US for bitcoin trading. The dollar volume of crypto received by users in Nigeria in May was $2.4bn, up from $684m last December, according to blockchain research firm <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-booming-in-nigeria-despite-banking-ban" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Chainalysis</a>. And the true scale of crypto flows through Africa’s largest economy is likely to be much larger, with many trades untraceable by analysts.</p><p>An array of factors, from political repression to currency controls and rampant inflation, have fuelled the stunning rise of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. In February, the government took fright and banned cryptocurrency transactions through licensed banks. In late July, it announced a pilot scheme for a new government-controlled digital currency – hoping to reduce incentives for those wanting to use unregulated crypto.</p><figure id="5700d2b4-301f-4671-b5a7-5bf19446dad9"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=33fb4b2ea2c611ab605a1d9914ae66bb 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=65b98790b61d8a9c801e6c857a42c9fb 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=b3561b5c975fdb0e3e6f0b181ac9c3f5 890w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ead661e60e3892a6ba470baa0146ef5f 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=41a3d223e16c457fc69c5fc3dca558cf 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe3be102f05184e37185952a09c04b51ab55c2a/0_548_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=725140abe01609967fbe49444392a0bc 445w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>A Lagos phone vendor who uses bitcoin in his business.</span> Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>But these measures have done little to dampen trading, with exchanges reporting a continued rise in transactions this year.</p><p>Nigeria’s experience holds lessons for governments around the world, many of which are now thinking hard about how to regulate digital currencies.

With many people looking for ways to escape widespread poverty, pyramid schemes are proliferating.</p><p>Trading in foreign currencies is an everyday activity for many. Remittances into Nigeria from those working abroad, which were worth more than $17bn in 2020, have played a role, as has the way digital currencies can provide insurance against exchange rate fluctuations.

It sent shockwaves and those shockwaves have continued.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/nigeria-cracks-down-on-end-sars-protesters-alleging-terrorism" title="" data-link-name="in body link">During the protests, Gatefield’s bank accounts were suspended</a>, until a court found the suspension unmerited and ordered that they be reopened earlier this year.</p><p>The episode reinforced the need many Nigerians felt to insure themselves against sudden moves by the authorities. Many organisations now keep some of their finances in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Speaking anonymously to avoid reprisals from the authorities, a leading figure in one civil society organisation, whose accounts were also briefly suspended last October, said digital currencies were now a key insurance against hostile interventions.</p><p>“We keep some securities in crypto – not too much but enough, sort of as an insurance policy,” they said. “When the ban happened we were, thankfully, able to pay salaries. This way, in a situation like that, we’ll have a way to keep paying our staff.”</p><p>In February, the Central Bank of Nigeria responded by telling banks to close the accounts of all customers using cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions would have to “identify persons and/or entities” making transactions in crypto or face sanctions.</p><p>The ban was at first a blow to an emerging industry of cryptocurrency brokers who relied on commercial banks to facilitate transactions between sellers and buyers. However, many customers found workarounds, said Marius Reitz, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Africa</a> general manager at Luno, a cryptocurrency trading platform.</p><p>“A lot of trading activity has now been pushed underground, which means many Nigerians are now depending on less secure, less transparent over-the-counter channels, as well as Telegram and WhatsApp groups, where people trade directly with each other,” Reitz said. The ban has made cryptocurrency trading harder to monitor and less safe. “This also means regulators now have a reduced level of visibility and control of the market, and unfortunately this can expose consumers to a higher risk of being defrauded.”</p><p>Platforms have also adjusted, by continuing to facilitate transactions as long as the currency being traded is not declared as a cryptocurrency.</p><p>While some platforms experienced a hit in trades, for others, the clampdown has increased demand for cryptocurrencies, not dampened it. In the first five months of 2021, according to Helsinki-based platform LocalBitcoins, Nigerians traded 50% more than in the same period last year.</p><p>The Nigerian government’s response to cryptocurrencies has in fact been inconsistent. Announcing the February curbs, the governor of the central bank, Godwin Emefiele, told a senate committee that cryptocurrency was “not legitimate money”.</p><p>At the same time, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo publicly rebuked the move. “Rather than adopt a policy that prohibits cryptocurrency operations in the Nigerian banking sector, we must act with knowledge and not fear,” he said, calling for a “robust regulatory regime that is thoughtful and knowledge-based”.</p><p>Another Nigerian government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been more open to creating a more regulated environment for cryptocurrency transactions.</p><p>The reality that cryptocurrencies cannot effectively be stopped had gradually dawned on the government, said the operator of one Nigerian crypto trading platform, speaking anonymously after having been targeted by the authorities. “They know they can’t really stop it. It’s out of their control, and what scares them is they are not used to being in this position.”</p><p><em>* Not his real surname</em></p><h2>Bitcoin: the pros and cons</h2><p>Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009, and remains the most widely known and valuable. It’s a digital or virtual asset, operating outside of the traditional banking system, and its influence has soared, with a growing number of companies now accepting it for payments.</p><p>Each bitcoin is essentially a digital token containing a secret key that proves to anyone in the network who it belongs to. Effectively, each bitcoin is a collective agreement of every other computer on the bitcoin network that the token is real, created by a bitcoin “miner”, and then acquired through a series of legitimate transactions.</p><p>Each time bitcoins are spent, it becomes known to the entire network that their ownership has been transferred. Every transaction is stored in a lasting public record called a blockchain, which underpins the entire system, making it possible to trace a coin’s history and preventing people from spending coins they do not own.</p><p>For bitcoin’s many advocates, there are several advantages to the virtual system – from the way the blockchain can be used to track things other than simple money, to support for “smart contracts”, which execute automatically when certain conditions are met.</p><p>But bitcoin’s biggest advantage is that it is decentralised and so extremely resistant to censorship or regulatory control by a single entity. It’s possible to observe a bitcoin payment in process, but no one can stop it. This has made governments wary: in a conventional financial system, banks can freeze accounts, vet payments for money laundering or enforce regulations.</p><p>Thanks to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency networks, people have been able to make international payments from closed or tightly restricted economies, but this has also made them a haven for illegal activities, from cybercrime to money laundering and drug trading.</p><p>Another concern about bitcoins is that they damage the environment. Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – consumes vast amounts of energy. Miners set up large computer rigs to maximise the chances of being awarded bitcoins. The carbon footprint of this “mining” is now similar to Chile’s, according to the <a href="https://cbeci.org/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index</a>, a tool from Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy usage.</p><p>Advocates of bitcoin say the mining is increasingly being done with electricity from renewable sources. And while the amount of energy consumed by bitcoin has dropped significantly this year, concerns remain. Environmentalists argue that miners tend to set up wherever electricity is cheapest, which may be in places with coal-generated power. <strong> </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<section>
	<p><span><span>I</span></span>n the seven difficult years since their son Mateo was diagnosed with a rare disease, Victoria Malvagno and Frank Solorzano have been waiting for medicine to catch up with their lives.</p>
<p>Doctors tested Mateo for hundreds of conditions before they finally determined he was one of only a few hundred people in the world with a neurodevelopmental condition called ADNP syndrome. Even with a diagnosis in hand, just getting through each day has been a full-time job. Mateo communicates mostly nonverbally, and his parents must constantly be on alert to make sure he doesn’t hurt himself. For years, they have muddled through managing his many symptoms piecemeal, because there’s no treatment approved for the rare genetic disease.</p>
<p>But in 2019, a breakthrough came — not from a doctor’s office, or a drug company, or another battery of tests. It came from an artificial intelligence system. The tool, called mediKanren, scanned millions of biomedical abstracts hunting for relationships between existing compounds and the gene involved in the disease.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>

<p>In seconds, it pinpointed an unexpected target: ketamine.</p>
<p>Ketamine’s history as a recreational drug might make it seem a dubious candidate to treat a rare disease in children. But it has long been approved as an anesthesia drug in kids and adults, and researchers were finalizing its approval as a treatment for major depression. The AI suggested it could be repurposed to fight a new foe — a strategy researchers hope will bear fruit for many untreated rare diseases.</p>
<p>This combination of artificial intelligence and a repurposed drug has enabled researchers to accelerate their usual timelines. In 2020, just a year and half after the system pinged on its result, the first clinical trial for ADNP syndrome was underway.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>

		<p>Last month, there was a hint of progress, when the trial reported preliminary safety results in 10 children, including Mateo, now a rambunctious 13-year-old who loves listening to music and splashing in sprinklers near his home in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
<p>Yet, cutting edge as it may be, researchers and families are mindful that technology can only do so much to speed up their fervent search for a treatment. Clinical trials are a knotty, costly business, and they’re especially difficult to conduct for rare diseases. Drug companies rarely invest in testing treatments with such a small potential market, despite financial incentives and expedited pathways from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>So as the pace of science slows back down, Mateo’s family and others affected by ADNP syndrome are stuck waiting again.</p>
<p>“For us as parents,” said Malvagno, “it can’t happen fast enough.”</p>
<p><span><span>T</span></span>he ketamine research that mediKanren found was years old, but nobody had advocated for the drug’s potential as a treatment for ADNP syndrome — until it landed in the inbox of a neurosurgeon named Matt Davis.</p>
<p>In February 2019, Davis was nearing the end of his residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, catching a quick moment between cases. “I was waiting for a patient to wake up from surgery and looking on my phone, and I got this email from Matt,” said Davis.</p>
<p>The other Matt was Matt Might, director at UAB’s Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute. The two were connected not just by their university, but by their experience as fathers of children with rare disease. Davis’ son Benjamin had been diagnosed with ADNP syndrome, which is caused by a mutation or deletion in the gene responsible for activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, a molecule that plays a crucial role in brain formation and the development of other organs; Might’s son, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/03/bertrand-might-matt-might-ngly1/">Bertrand</a>, had another genetic condition called NGLY1 deficiency.</p>
		<p>Might had been building an <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/25/ai-expert-writing-code-save-son/">artificial-intelligence-driven system</a> called mediKanren to help find treatments for rare diseases, including Bertrand’s. Part of the Translator project funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, the program works to harvest biomedical data from diverse sources, structure it, and connect the dots. It’s looking for what Might calls “unknown knowns”: drug interactions that have already been revealed by science but remain buried deep in millions of data points.</p>
<p>“It looks like low-dose ketamine is an upregulator for ADNP,” wrote Might. “Do you think this makes sense for ADNP patients?”</p>
<p><span>On his phone, Davis did a quick literature search. “It was an absolute lightbulb moment,” he said. “I was immediately struck by how exciting a potential treatment option this was for ADNP.” In addition to broad disturbances in sleep, vision, cardiac health, and digestion in many patients, the syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, speech and motor delays, and autism symptoms. Most drugs for neurodevelopmental disorders act at the level of the synapse by changing neurotransmitters, Davis explained. But Might’s system suggested that ketamine could alter ADNP gene expression — addressing the syndrome almost at its root.  </span></p>
		<p>“In these patients, that gene is sort of running at 50% capacity: One copy’s broken, the other copy’s working,” explained Might. “So the tool, when it sees that, says, ‘OK, well, maybe I can make the functioning copy work twice as hard to compensate.’”</p>
<p>Davis soon found studies that seemed to confirm the premise. A 2017 <a href="https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/23/11/2769#:~:text=Results%3A%20ADNP%20was%20overexpressed%20in,growth%20in%20xenografts%20in%20vivo." target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a> pulled up by the mediKanren platform found that low doses of ketamine induced the expression of ADNP in mouse cancer cells. Another 2015 paper showed the same relationship in rat <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452215000512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurons</a>.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly rare disease. There just weren’t many people looking outside the box in terms of ways to treat it,” said Davis. “So I don’t think it came on anyone’s radar because the number of people looking was so small.”</p>
<p>Davis, also the chief scientific officer for the ADNP Kids Research Foundation, shared what he had with its founder, Sandra Sermone. In 2014, her son <a href="https://www.adnpkids.com/tony.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony</a> was the first person to be diagnosed with ADNP syndrome in the United States, shortly after a group of researchers in Belgium first <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24531329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> the syndrome.</p>

<p>“It seemed too good to be true,” said Sermone. “I took it with a grain of salt, and we just started investigating everything.”</p>
<p>The foundation had been down this road before, with a promising peptide drug called NAP discovered by researchers at Tel Aviv University alongside ADNP in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10037502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1997</a>. The foundation tried to kick off a study in ADNP syndrome with Coronis NeuroSciences, an Israeli company formed to commercialize the peptide, but the planned trial hadn’t materialized.</p>
<p><span>Ketamine had the potential to be different, though. Unlike a novel peptide that would need to be formulated and packaged, generic ketamine is cheap to access and already in wide use as an anesthetic. </span><span>There has also been a resurgence in research on the drug for treatment-resistant depression and other mental health conditions. In </span><span>2019</span><span>, Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/05/fda-approves-esketamine-antidepressant/">received FDA approval</a> for a form of ketamine delivered by nasal spray. </span></p>
<p>The drug has risks, including dissociative effects that can impact patients differently. Subanesthetic levels of the drug may mildly increase blood pressure, and higher doses used for anesthesia have been associated with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22908104/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive deficits</a> when used in very young children. But the drug’s fairly well-understood safety profile made ketamine a lead worth following.</p>
		<p>So in April 2019, Sermone brought their research to Joseph Buxbaum, head of the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai in New York. Buxbaum and his colleagues dug into the papers on their own — and soon, Alex Kolevzon, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical director at the center, was designing a trial and working to get it approved. By May, the center was ready to start recruitment.</p>
<p>While Sermone was working to kick off the trial, she thought her son would be eligible; he was just young enough to make the age cutoff. But in March, as the pandemic’s first wave was building, Tony developed a fever that gave way to seizures, then failing lungs and kidneys. He had to be put on a ventilator. He survived after nearly two weeks in the hospital, but it became too risky for him to take an experimental drug.</p>
<p>“It’s a blessing and a curse,” said Sermone. “If my son was in it, because I’m one of the ones who found it, people would think that I got preferential treatment.”</p>
<p>In the end, the trial recruited 10 kids ages 5 to 12. It was another child just at the very top of the age threshold who filled in one of the slots: Malvagno’s son Mateo.</p>
<figure id="attachment_708234"><a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ketamine_Trial_038.jpg"></a><figcaption><span>Mateo works with his applied behavior analysis instructor, Chelsea Rodriguez, at home.</span> <cite>Alice Proujansky for STAT</cite></figcaption></figure><p><span><span>“I</span></span><span> was on the fence about doing this trial to begin with,” said Malvagno. Like the other parents of trial participants, who have the right to consent on behalf of their children, she had to weigh the potential benefits against the downsides of uprooting Mateo’s care and routines.</span></p>
<p><span>For 40 minutes, each of the kids would have to sit with an IV in their arm as the drug pumped into their veins, and return for three rounds of follow-up tests over the next month. The parents would fill out standardized assessments of symptoms like irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Clinicians would mirror those with their own list of measures. “We wanted to get a battery of more objective assessments,” said Kolevzon, including electrophysiological and eye tracking studies. And critically, they’d test blood to let them see whether ADNP expression actually increased. </span></p>
<p><span>“Who wants to put their child through weekly blood draws or a 40-minute infusion?” said Malvagno. </span></p>
<p><span>None of those visits would be easy to manage. “My kid is like a bull in a china shop,” said Malvagno. “He has to be anesthetized for people to look at his teeth, and when he comes out of it, he goes staggering down the hospital hallways. No way we’re going to get him to sit for these tests with the little EEG cap.”</span></p>
		<p><span>To prepare the kids and their parents, the Seaver center sent stickers to practice applying to the kids’ chests, so they could get comfortable with the sensory experience of ECG readings. Some children practiced wearing a blood pressure cuff ahead of time. During the infusions, the center provided a therapist who played guitar for the kids who are calmed by music.</span></p>
<p><span>“I had my doubts about getting through all of it,” said Malvagno, “but we did it, we made it through.” </span></p>
<p><span>In July, the early results came in. The work still has yet to be submitted to or published in a peer-reviewed journal, and the RNA analysis that will show whether ketamine increased ADNP expression is still pending. But there were no reports of serious adverse events, and the preliminary analysis of the parent and clinicians’ assessments showed positive changes one week after the infusion. </span></p>
<p><span>“It was different for different kids,” said Kolevzon, “but we heard improvement around things like hyperactivity, we heard improvement around things like sensory sensitivities. We heard improvement around things like language — not necessarily verbal output, but communication. Those are all extremely important domains that are clinically meaningful.”</span></p>
<p><span>As Kolevzon and his colleagues caution, though, “it’s not uncommon for early-stage pilot studies like this to be positive.” That’s due, in part, to the bias brought into play with measures reported by providers and parents. “Any time that your child has as many issues as kids with ADNP syndrome have, and then they’re given a drug, parents become very optimistic about whether it’s helping them,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span>The early results also only analyzed the drug’s impact after one week; the durability of its effect could have an impact on its utility. And while more data may show the drug increases ADNP expression, it’s unclear how big of an impact that would have on brains that developed without enough of the protein. A more direct fix would involve correcting the mutation itself through gene therapy.</span></p>
<p><span>For the parents involved, though, it’s hard to temper enthusiasm after the preliminary results. “The hairs on my arms stand up every time I think about it, even now,” said Sermone. </span></p>
<p><span>Several parents told STAT they saw significant changes in their children’s communication and behavior that lasted for four to 11 days after the infusion. “It felt like we weren’t covering up or trying to mask symptoms,” said Amanda Eichenberger, mom to trial participant Zella, who started having success with potty training for the first time in the week after the infusion. “It felt like we were doing something of significance, like a cognitive change that was going on beneath the surface.” </span></p>
<p><span>Mateo received his infusion on a Thursday, and Malvagno saw an immediate change. </span></p>

<p><span>“He was still himself, he was still my mischievous little Mateo,” she said. “But he was calm, and focused.” He stopped his persistent vocalizations, which sometimes last for hours at a time. “I was able to be a parent for the first time, just a parent, not a damage control ninja warrior expert ready to leap tall buildings in order to stop my child from injuring himself.”</span></p>
<p><span>On the Sunday after the infusion, they went for a walk on the beach at Coney Island, and at one point, Malvagno gestured for Mateo to come sit with her in the sand — something they never do. “He came over next to me and he sat on the sand, and we lay down for 30 to 40 minutes,” said Malvagno. “It was very emotional for me.” They were both able to simply stop and be together.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_708125"><a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ketamine_Trial_167.jpg"></a><figcaption><span>Mateo plays in a playground sprinkler.</span> <cite>Alice Proujansky for STAT</cite></figcaption></figure><p><span><span>E</span></span><span>xperts emphasize that the results of a small safety study should not be touted as evidence ketamine works. What the trial does signal is a path forward — if not an unobstructed one — for future ADNP syndrome research.</span></p>
<p><span>“It was simultaneously a big win for AI — to show that this is possible, and you can have AI come up with a meaningful suggestion — and you can turn it over to a really engaged patient community and they’re willing to run with it from there,” said Might. </span></p>
<p><span>But families affected by rare disease can only run so far on their own. AI got them off the blocks by uncovering the potential of a repurposed drug, and they’ve sprinted through the first clinical trial in record time. To determine whether ketamine is safe and effective enough to use as a treatment for ADNP syndrome, they’ll need to start training for a marathon.</span></p>
<p><span>Kolevzon plans to finish up the study’s analysis and submit for publication by the end of the year, and is already planning a randomized controlled trial with blinding.</span></p>
<p><span>With more participants, it likely won’t be practical to ask kids and their families to travel to New York for weeks on end. So Kolevzon is considering a different dosing schedule and other delivery modes — including a nasal spray, oral, and subcutaneous delivery — to make a more distributed trial possible. </span></p>
		<p><span>“We want to design it in a way that it can actually get approved,” said Kolevzon. “Because at the end of the day, if we’re going to make this available to the families, it needs to be covered by insurance. And in order to get it covered by insurance, it needs to be approved by the FDA.”</span></p>
<p><span>The first ketamine trial was unique in its speed and low cost. A virtual charity run organized by the foundation raised $150,000 and paid for the first study in full, with average donations in the range of $20 to $100. “There’s no way we can keep up,” said Sermone, who guesses the next study will cost more than $1 million. The foundation had another fundraiser at the end of July, but these families can only tap their networks so often; this time, they raised only </span><a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/Donate/WA/BrushPrairie/ADNPWarriorRunVirtual5K" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>$100,000</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“We need to have Richard Branson or somebody become a sugar daddy,” Malvagno quipped.</span></p>
<p><span>More likely will be traditional funding sources, like grants from the National Institutes of Health. If ketamine is shown to upregulate ADNP in the study, it could also catch the attention of scientists and funding organizations invested in research on other disorders. ADNP mutations are one of the most frequent single-gene causes of autism, and the protein regulates more than 400 other genes. </span></p>
<p><span>“That’s always been our strategy,” said Kolevzon. “When you take relatively common forms of autism spectrum disorder, the idea is we’re trying to use those specific genetic forms to understand autism more broadly.” </span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, improvements in tools like mediKanren could make this kind of accelerated research pathway more common. Right now, requests to use the system go through Might’s precision medicine institute at UAB. The ketamine lead only ended up in the right hands by happenstance, said Davis. “I happened to know Matt Might, he happened to run ADNP through his system, and all I did was review the literature enough to be able to say, holy crap, this actually is an incredibly exciting potential treatment.” </span></p>
		<p><span>At the end of July, though, the NIH released a funding call to develop a more public-facing user interface for the translator tools, including mediKanren. Might plans to put in a proposal to build a more usable front end for physician-scientists who want to access the biomedical literature in this structured way. </span></p>
<p><span>Broadly disseminated AI tools may be able to speed up the time it takes to discover a drug worth testing in a clinical trial, and repurposing an existing drug accelerates the process even more. But as the ADNP parents have discovered, even a rapid influx of AI-generated ideas will still leave them playing the waiting game.</span></p>
<p><span>“Some of us have waited so long,” said Malvagno, “and I don’t know if Mateo’s going to be available to be in the next trial,” now that he’s aged out of the original inclusion criteria. </span></p>
<p><span>Until they have more answers, Malvagno and other parents remain stuck trying to make treatment decisions based on limited information. “When you have so little evidence-based medicine when it comes to this syndrome, you really start grasping at straws and looking for anything,” said Eichenberger.  </span></p>
<p><span>There is now an option that they might not have considered before: off-label ketamine. “Everybody’s thinking about it,” said Kolevzon. “It’s an obvious question.” Though ketamine is nowhere near an FDA approval for ADNP syndrome, doctors can choose to prescribe it for uses other than its approved indications. </span></p>
<p><span>“That always makes it a really, really tough decision because of the ethical considerations,” said Steve Levine, co-founder of ketamine-assisted therapy clinic Heading Health. “Is there sufficient evidence to support this? Is it really possible to fully consent a patient given the desperation, as well as maybe not enough information to really make a good decision?” </span></p>
<p><span>To Sermone and Kolevzon, the answer is clear: While the results are promising, they’re far from a green light. “I advise strongly against trying to pursue ketamine, commercially or clinically, because of safety concerns and the risk of losing our opportunity to study it rigorously,” said Kolevzon. Despite all the progress made in the last two and half years, the ADNP syndrome community still doesn’t have a treatment in hand. </span></p>
<p><span>For the parents whose children participated in the trial, it’s especially wrenching to return to uncertainty. “That full week after the ketamine was a life-changing experience for me as a parent,” said Malvagno. “I want that back.”</span></p></section>

Since 2018, Sacks has been going on what she calls “trash walks” in New York City, rummaging through the city’s discards in search of usable items – and documenting what she finds on Instagram (and more recently, TikTok), under <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thetrashwalker/" data-link-name="in body link">the handle</a> @thetrashwalker. On social media and in real life, Sacks never seems to run out of patience, even when confronted with the scale and pervasiveness of the problem she is trying to solve: our culture of throwing things out, which leads to businesses and consumers alike producing untold amounts of waste. By rooting through the trash in the country’s most densely populated city, Sacks hopes to expose just how much of what we deem to be garbage really isn’t.</p><figure id="a308694b-1c20-4085-bdf3-b1c81a91c3f8"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=cd49029a6b49b2c1e29f62b70c4c9d10 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=86e3cc5fdd94d333bae847151f7d813e 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=feeba6aa4b360f264e0836c7252b0279 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=278231bbd3db048ca76d010848266d09 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=80392854c7906313f5f5b7bb547af06b 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8050996c46720ccec54a85e231380e98 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bbb2725ed1b635c74292e14e90a52bfe 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f01355b986c7af855201acf3782561b9 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d40de1c9c52485da9bca034ea2dd57eb 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115e01c3fda62abdfa1bb6598b6236494bb41ef9/0_0_4741_5926/master/4741.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d4a682adcce9d6a53860d7e547e8813c 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Sacks ventures out in the Upper West Side on a freezing, windy Friday evening in December 2020.</span> Photograph: Ismail Ferdous/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>There are other Instagram accounts that highlight the possibilities of dumpster diving and regifting, like @<a href="https://instagram.com/stoopingnyc" data-link-name="in body link">stoopingnyc</a>. But more than publicizing discarded loveseats and Ikea dressers left on the street, Sacks’s work shines a light on the shame and indignity of producing this much waste – by showcasing just a fraction of the usable food, clothing, housewares and more that gets thrown out every day.</p><p>Sacks, 30, is an unflappable native New Yorker and environmental activist, with bright, curly red hair and an unwavering readiness to talk about her life’s work. On a trash walk last year, she laughed when I asked if she had to train herself to overcome any hesitancy before digging through people’s recycling. “This doesn’t gross me out,” she said.</p><p>“I don’t see myself stopping,” she added at another point. “I do this because I love it and it’s fun and exciting and it relaxes me. I lose track of time.”</p><p>Sacks’s trash walks have captured media attention over the years. In 2019, the Today Show joined Sacks on a trash walk, hitting <a href="https://www.today.com/money/anna-sacks-digs-through-corporate-trash-environment-t164180" data-link-name="in body link">five different CVS locations</a>. In January 2020, the New York Post accompanied Sacks as she went through <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/18/starbucks-still-throwing-away-boxes-of-food-after-no-waste-pledge/" data-link-name="in body link">Starbucks’ trash</a> and found that the chain “throw[s] away a king’s feast of unsold food every night”. (Within a week of their story’s publication, Starbucks announced new goals to reduce <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2020/message-from-starbucks-ceo-kevin-johnson-starbucks-new-sustainability-commitment/" data-link-name="in body link">landfill waste</a>.)</p><p>Earlier this year, Sacks recalls finding “bags and bags” full of outdated decorations and paraphernalia outside a local Party City: New Year’s Eve napkins and tablecloths, Valentine’s Day plates, NFL merch from the Super Bowl. She posted about it in her neighborhood <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/used-goods-homeless-coronavirus-remembrance/wasted-buy-nothing" data-link-name="in body link">Buy Nothing</a> Facebook group, and took as much home as she could; a few days later, a woman who saw her post came by to take some of the items, hoping to use them in the pediatric hospital where she works.</p><p>“Honestly, it’s stuff that never should be made to begin with,” she says. Turning serious, she adds: “But my view is as long as it’s made, it should be used.”</p><figure id="b4dc13ef-995d-4552-9d1d-6c6588bd8f8b"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c9bc07dede2a4a75f91c3d86e2f9a56d 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a5a3114819d5ffa31f8f32206ff34e36 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c7158d744842f00019175aa5625b1137 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c7158d744842f00019175aa5625b1137 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=23f01754e1169065de28f55734b493be 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=638bcd0987336f4204f94c17a385e9f1 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=8c9d090a4b54e9956bc82878fc25c752 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d3996bec1970a4273dcf4c870141d8cb 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=741f5c91d2b0305e405145505acb9939 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3e09d28a449acd46cf3efb80f4972f07 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3e09d28a449acd46cf3efb80f4972f07 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=61b23b52c4a9b53efb759c9e84a47914 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57dd4353f6097f457b2d999a9ae52538 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb157a941073d94b911caaee1d726bf03412152a/0_0_5767_4614/master/5767.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fbeffc60151583a9bbb4a716f5b10bca 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Anna Sacks goes through recycling left out for sanitation pickup.</span> Photograph: Ismail Ferdous/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Much of Sacks’s work takes aim at corporations. But she also sorts through residential recycling in her Upper West Side neighbourhood, which she takes as proof that there isn’t enough education around what’s really recyclable and what’s not.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLUjyYcJoVZ/" data-link-name="in body link">another video</a>, she digs through a bag of toys, including what look like hundreds of Lego pieces, put out as recycling. “There’s no way this is getting recycled in the normal recycling system,” she says on the video, fist full of Legos. “They’re too small. They’ll literally fall through the cracks.”</p><p>Zero-waste influencers have been around a long time, and in New York City, retired sanitation worker Nelson Molina has been showcasing his best trash finds, collected over years on the job, turning a city sanitation facility into a kind of <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/10/treasures-in-the-trash-a-secret-museum-inside-a-working-new-york-city-department-of-sanitation-garage.html" data-link-name="in body link">living art project</a>. But what’s different about Sacks’s Instagram is that it reveals the kind psychic pain that comes with bearing witness to – this much waste.</p><p>Last year Sacks put out a call on TikTok, asking anyone who had worked in retail and had been instructed to destroy unsold or returned merchandise to share their story. One TikTok user <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHiojiDFkLI/" data-link-name="in body link">described</a> having to slash an office chair with a box cutter while working at an office supply store.</p><p>“It was disgusting,” the user said, adding that their managers later “watched me throw it in the trash, to make sure I would actually put in the trash. And I just – that didn’t feel right..”</p><p>This collection of horror stories – she shares the responses she’s gotten on TikTok under the hashtag #RetailMadeMe – captures a dystopian dynamic: asking low-wage retail employees to destroy goods or food that they themselves might actually want or need and not be able to afford.</p><p>In another particularly grim video that Sacks received and shared – unrelated to the #RetailMadeMe callout – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJzMqsXlYPb/" data-link-name="in body link">a live parakeet</a> was<strong> </strong>found in the trash outside a Petco location.</p><figure id="0c418e28-a420-423e-8f88-729f175c6790"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=133d408549594e1e2e753a3c690506b0 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=266c9f6fd3648c0b1d38430f0683c378 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=bbadc74ed0e9dac793a29431a921c6f5 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=edd74de2417830153cbca49e6a30025c 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=1c1471c3063cdd32c92e7e7a62707a08 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=3394d2d13cdb6ae17816bc3ae907757c 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f4572de964011b028a3a231373bea368 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f72b570d0809332aa74fa6d780cb5fd5 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=cf53fea9cd3a26c19b779b52930f21e9 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3f2b994525ecae7980a34736b75c34521e49ab/0_0_4185_5231/master/4185.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5d291b763ebbe2d65af30c1744a4a766 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>‘My view is as long as it’s made, it should be used.’</span> Photograph: Ismail Ferdous/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><h2>The immense scale of waste requires large-scale solutions </h2><p>As the climate crisis continues, the need to reduce and divert waste has never been higher. In the 2020 fiscal year, New York City residents produced just under 10,000 tons of waste every day, according to <a href="https://dsny.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/about_dsny-non-dsny-collections-FY2020.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">a report</a> from the department of sanitation. Once it’s collected, none of it stays in New York City; roughly two-thirds of Manhattan’s residential waste goes to a waste-to-energy facility in Essex county, New Jersey. The rest of the city’s non-recyclable waste ends up in landfills and other waste-to-energy facilities in upstate New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.</p><p>For decades, dumpster divers and freegans <a href="https://thecounter.org/freeganism-alex-barnard/" data-link-name="in body link">have brought attention</a> to the vast quantities of food that gets thrown out by grocery stores and restaurants every day, and have searched other people’s trash to support themselves. In recent years, the rise of <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/stoopingnyc-instagram-new-york-sidewalk-treasures" data-link-name="in body link">stooping</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2021-04-15/angelenos-gleaning-collecting-extra-produce-food-hyperlocal-apps" data-link-name="in body link">Buy Nothing</a> groups has hinged on the idea of a economy of sharing, in which goods and services are exchanged freely between people who need them.</p><p>But these practices are pretty old. “People finding objects or food or ways of supporting their livelihood from the street [is] as old as the city itself,” says Robin Nagle, a professor at New York University with a focus on waste. Using Instagram to bring more attention to overproduction and waste, she notes, “could be the beginning of – or a push towards – more systemic changes in the flow of material”.</p><p>Sacks’s work hinges on the idea that trash could be not-trash if only it were in a different location – if it were retrieved from the waste stream and dropped into, say, your living room. It’s an empowering idea, effective in its simplicity. We all need things – maybe even things that somebody else is throwing out and willing to give away for free. But this idea also has its limits: on my trash walk with Sacks, we passed countless items left out in the recycling – a toaster, a nameplate that said “boss lady”, a self-help book on divorce, buttons for sewing, a full set of dishes and cutlery – all of which were still perfectly useful, but just not to me.</p><p>Which is partly why Sacks believes that real change will take big shifts in how corporations operate. In 2019, Sacks sent an email to Larry Merlo, then CEO of CVS Pharmacy, asking why they were throwing away items instead of donating them. The next day, Sacks received a call from a CVS regional manager in New York City; he later said he’d gotten special permission to donate goods from certain stores.</p><p>But herein lies the problem of reducing waste: the immense scale. CVS Pharmacy has <a href="https://cvshealth.com/about-cvs-health/our-company-at-a-glance" data-link-name="in body link">nearly 10,000 locations</a> across the US and Puerto Rico. “You shouldn’t need to receive special permission from the CEO to form new donation partnerships,” says Sacks. “How are you going to manage that?”</p><p>Sacks repeatedly comes back to the idea that retailers could give away unsold or lightly used, returned (but still good) items to their low-wage employees, instead of tossing them, or jumping through bureaucratic hurdles to donate them. This could be an “added perk”, she says, or an additional form of compensation, to bolster employees’ wages.</p><figure id="73526c73-a224-4211-aa7f-23d03dadf0a3"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=64244523cf1226cc7a81b2231aaba021 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=d12c6fb45dbb8a62bd40661d5a4a0328 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=9f5b9a88b5bf038ad8e9e715f14bef90 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=9f5b9a88b5bf038ad8e9e715f14bef90 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0032df6e80e47a67d68dd1a95af1b44b 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=d3e0da8d01cc21d13f6b5278e9088ff5 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=5a1063fe76caeaff31244aab529800dc 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e5ca465c6de4704aaa46f6b26d005420 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=82e72efa8a82088564517edd4f497f0d 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=075dc0d4c487889cec6642860669fe68 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=075dc0d4c487889cec6642860669fe68 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=edd6f8ca7f3f97a28832acde83cec726 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2e46220bc554a1162d2510d3248b8b01 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba2a384854535defc75af18c74ec0b89ef0f057/0_2444_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=617ba95964af09dda7a6a98dbea49457 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>‘I get so many comments [on Instagram] that say corporations want to donate but they can’t because they’ll be sued.’</span> Photograph: Ismail Ferdous/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>But Sacks recognises just how difficult this would be, requiring “a larger change in a corporate mentality of how they view employees”.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>

The dream of automating software development has been present from 
the early days of the computer age. Already back in 1945, as part of his vision 
for the Automatic Computing Engine, Alan Turing argued that 
</p><p>
<quote>
Instruction tables will have to be made up by mathematicians with computing 
experience and perhaps a certain puzzle-solving ability…

This process of constructing instruction tables should be very fascinating. 
There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes 
that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself.
<cite>copeland2012alan</cite>
</quote> 
</p><p>


Traditionally, the way automation was incorporated into software development was through
the use of compilers and high-level languages. 
When the first FORTRAN compiler was developed, it was
touted as &#34;The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System&#34;, it&#39;s 
goal was nothing less than to allow the IBM 704 to
</p><quote>
code problems for itself and produce as good programs
as human coders (but without the errors)
<cite>Backus:1957</cite>
</quote><p>.

</p><p>

Compilation and synthesis are very closely related in terms of their goals, they both 
aim to support the generation of software from a high-level description of its 
behavior. In general, though, we expect a synthesizer to do more than translate 
a program from one notation to another as traditional compilers do;
we expect it to discover <i>how</i> to perform
the desired task. The line can be blurry since some aggressive optimizing
compilers can be argued to actually discover how to perform a computation that was 
specified at a high-level of abstraction (parallelizing compilers are a good example).
One distinguishing feature between a compiler and a synthesizer is the element of <i>search</i>.
In a compiler, an input description of the computation is transformed into a program
by applying transformation rules according to a pre-defined schedule. By contrast, 
a synthesizer is generally understood to involve a search for the program that
satisfies the stated requirements. Again, the line is blurry, because several
modern research compilers aggressively search the space of transformations to find 
optimal implementations in a process known as <i>Autotuning</i>.  

</p><p>

Another class of techniques that is closely associated with synthesis is 
<i>declarative programming</i>, and in particular <i>logic programming</i>. 
The dream of logic programming was that programmers would be able to express
the requirements of their computation in a logical form, and when given an input, 
the runtime system would derive an output that satisfies the logical constraints through
a combination of search and deduction. So the goals are also closely related to program synthesis, 
but there are some important distinctions. First, rather than trying to discover an algorithm 
to solve a particular problem, logic programming systems rely on a generic algorithm to search
for a solution to every problem. Thins means that for many problems, they can be dramatically slower
than a specialized program to solve a particular task. Additionally, if the problem is under-specified,
the user may get a solution at runtime that is very far from the solution that was expected 
for the program. 

</p><p>

Finally, Machine Learning corresponds to a third class of approaches that are closely related to program synthesis. 
The canonical problem in Machine Learning is finding a function whose behavior closely matches a given dataset. 
So machine learning problems can be thought of as a special case of program synthesis problems where the specification
comes in the form of data. The biggest distinction between program synthesis and Machine Learning is that in Machine Learning, 
the space of functions that the algorithm considers is very tightly prescribed. For example, linear classifiers, decision 
trees and neural networks are some examples of classes of functions that have been very well studied, and each of these
classes has its own specialized set of algorithms for deriving a function that matches a dataset. By contrast, 
in program synthesis we are interested in general algorithms that can work with more general classes of programs, 
with a particular interest in programs that support recursion or other forms of iteration. Traditionally, there
was a second important distinction in that program synthesis generally aspired to discovering programs 
that precisely matched the specification, whereas in machine learning the notion of learning from noisy data is deeply 
engrained in all algorithms. This distinction is less relevant today since there is strong interest in the synthesis 
commonity on algorithms that are robust to noise, or that behave well in the presence of incomplete specifications. 




</p><h2> Program Synthesis</h2><p>

So if program synthesis is not compilation, it is not logic programming, 
and it is not machine learning, then what is program synthesis?
As mentioned before, different people in the community have different working definitions 
of what they would describe as program synthesis, but I believe the definition below is one 
that both captures most of what today we understand as program synthesis and also 
excludes some of the aforementioned classes of approaches. 

</p><p>
Program Synthesis correspond to a class of techniques that are able to generate a program 
from a collection of artifacts that establish semantic and syntactic requirements for the generated code.
</p><p>

There are two elements of this definition that are important. The first is an emphasis on the generation of a program; 
we expect the synthesizer to produce code that solves our problem, as opposed to relying on extensive
search at runtime to find a solution for a particular input, as logic programming systems do. 
The second is the emphasis on supporting specification
of both semantic and syntactic requirements. We expect synthesis algorithms to provide us with some control 
over the space of programs that are going to be considered, not just their intended behavior. 
It is important to emphasize that individual synthesis systems may not themselves provide this flexibility; in fact, 
the biggest successes of synthesis so far have been in specialized domains where constraints on the space of programs
have been &#34;baked in&#34; to the synthesis system. Nevertheless, even if the flexibility is not exposed to the users, 
the underlying synthesis algorithms do have significant flexibility in how the space of programs is defined, and 
this is a big differentiator both with respect to compilation and with respect to machine learning. 
In general, both of these requirements imply that our synthesis procedures will rely on some form of search, 
although the success of synthesis will be largely driven by our ability to avoid having to exhaustively search
the exponentially large space of programs that arise for even relatively simple synthesis problems. 



</p><h2>Program Synthesis Today</h2>
 
<slide>Lecture1:Slide14;Lecture1:Slide15</slide><p>
These days, program synthesis is an active area of research with research papers being published every year in all
the major programming systems conferences (PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA), as well as in formal methods (CAV, TACAS) 
and machine learning (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML). One important branch of synthesis research is focused on pushing the 
envolope in terms of our ability to automatically generate non-trivial algorithms from very high-level artifacts. 
Today, we are able to synthesize interesting algorithms such as 
Karatsuba big-integer multiplication<cite>sketchthesis</cite>, Strassen&#39;s matrix-multiplication<cite>Srivastava:2010</cite>, or the functional 
cartesian product algorithm of Barron and C. Strachey, which is considered the first functional pearl<cite>Feser:2015</cite>.
And when it comes to the synthesis of programs from formal specifications, we are now able to synthesize provably 
correct implementations of fairly complex algorithms; in a few years, we have been able to move 
from things like sorting and list reversal to algorithms and data-structure manipulations such as 
insertion into red-black trees or binary heaps<cite>Polikarpova:2016</cite>. 
Another area where synthesis is fairly advanced is in the synthesis of bit-vector manipulations. 
The winner of the most recent synthesis competition was able to synthesize every bit-vector manipulation that 
the organizers threw at it. 

</p><p>

Another important branch of synthesis research focuses on the application of synthesis techniques to a broad class of problems. 
For example, one area where program synthesis has been particularly succesful 
is in the area of &#34;Data Wrangling&#34;, the manipulation of data, especially by people with no prior programming experience.
The first commercial application of program synthesis was <i>FlashFill</i><cite>gulwani:2011:flashfill</cite>, a feature that was first incorporated
into Excell 2013, which allows users to do data manipulation by providing a few examples and automatically derives
a small program from the examples and applies the program to the rest of your data.
On the research side, there have been significant advances in the ability to synthesize fairly complex database queries 
either from examples<cite>Wang:2017</cite>, or from natural language queries<cite>Yaghmazadeh:2017</cite>.
This area has proven to be a good fit for our current synthesis capabilities because on the one hand, there 
is a strong need to make data analysis and cleaning accessible to non-programmers, and on the other hand, the
programs in question are generally small and easy to describe through examples or other forms of natural interaction. 

</p><p>

</slide>

Another area that has seen major interest is the reverse engineering of code. 
Traditionally, we think of synthesis as starting with a specification and generating 
an implementation from that. But in this case, that paradigm is flipped on its head: starting
from an implementation, the goal is to infer a specification that characterizes the behavior of the given
implementation. The idea was first proposed by Susmit Jha, Sumit Gulwani, Sanjit Seshia and Ashish Tiwari<cite>Jha:2010</cite>.
It has most recently been popularized by Alvin Cheung in an approach known as <i>Verified Lifting</i>, where the goal 
is to discover a high-level representation that is provably equivalent to an implementation and that can be used
to generate a more efficient version of the code. The idea was first applied to the problem of generating SQL queries
that are equivalent to a piece of imperative code, but has most recently been applied to a variety of problems ranging
from modernizing legacy HPC applications<cite>Kamil:2016</cite>, to optimizing Map Reduce programs <cite>Ahmad:2018</cite>.

</p><p>
Another recent example of the use of synthesis for reverse engineering involves the creation of models of complex code for
the purpose of program analysis. For example, a recent paper by Jinseong Jeon et al. <cite>Jeon:2016</cite> showed that
it was possible to use synthesis to create models of complex reactive frameworks such as the Android and Java Swing by recording
traces of the interaction between the framework and a test application and then forcing the synthesizer to produce a model
that conforms to that trace and that follows known design patterns. A similar idea was used by 	Heule, Sridharan and Chandra
to synthesize models of array manipulation routines in JavaScript <cite>Heule:2015</cite>. 

</p><p>
<slide>

Lecture1:Slide43;
Lecture1:Slide44
</slide>
One particularly interesting research thrust is the application of synthesis techniques for problems that
seemingly have nothing to do with automatic programming; there is a growing realization that program synthesis techniques can 
actually be applied in a number of domains that have traditionally been though of as AI. For example, 
back in 2013, we demonstrated that it was possible to apply program synthesis to the problem of providing feedback
for programming assignments<cite>Singh:2013</cite>; similar ideas have been used to other
forms of automated tutoring, from teaching automata theory<cite>D&#39;antoni:2015</cite> to teaching 
deduction <cite>AhmedGK13</cite>.

</p><p>

More broadly, one of the more exciting research directions around program synthesis is the interaction between 
synthesis and machine learning. On the one hand, there has been a lot of recent interest in applying machine
learning techniques to synthesis problems, for example to be able to learn how to use complex APIs<cite>MuraliCJ17a</cite>. 
But there is also significant interest in applying ideas from program synthesis to machine learning problems, 
for example, in order to allow you to learn with less data or to generate interpretable models. 
For example, in recent work, we showed that it was possible to learn language morphology rules from 
small numbers of examples, or to learn visual concepts much more efficiently than with traditional machine learning<cite>EllisST15</cite>.





</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>

In general, there are three major challenges one has to address when working with program synthesis. 
In a recent paper, we refer to these as the Three Pillars of machine programming<cite>GottschlichSTCR18</cite>. 

</p><p>
<b>Intention.</b>
The first challenge is what we have termed the Intention challenge: how do the users tell you their goals?
The definition of synthesis talks about semantic and syntactic constraints, but the exact form of these
will influence all subsequent decisions about the synthesis system. The success of the 
FlashFill<cite>gulwani:2011:flashfill</cite> system has popularized the use of input-output examples 
as a means of specification, but input-output examples are not suitable for every task. 
In our own work on storyboard programming, we advocated for an approach to multi-modal synthesis, 
where concrete examples were combined with abstract examples and logical specifications, so that 
together they provided enough information about the intended behavior to produce a working 
implementation of a data-structure manipulation<cite>SinghS12</cite>. 
</p><p>
One big aspect of the intention challenge is how to cope with under-specification. If there are multiple 
programs that satisfy the requirements, how can we tell which one the user actually wants? 
Of course one solution is to simply ignore this problem, if the user provides a partial specification, 
they have no right to complain if they get a different program from the one they wanted. In practice, though,
making a good choice can make the difference between a system that is useful, and one that is not. 
</p>


<p>
<b>Invention.</b>

The second challenge once we know what the user wants is to actually discover a piece of code that will 
satisfy those requirements. Arguably this is the central challenge of synthesis, as it potentially involves
inventing new algorithmic solutions to a problem. One of the key questions we will be dealing with in this
course are different techniques that the community has developed to tackle the inherent complexity of this task.
</p>

<p>
<b>Adaptation</b>

The canonical view of synthesis is that the user is creating a brand new algorithm from scratch, and wants to leverage
a synthesizer to create a correct implementation of the desired algorithm. However, most software development involves
working in the context of existing software systems, fixing bugs, optimizing code, and performing other kinds of maintenance
tasks. This pillar deals with the question of synthesis in a broader context, and the application of synthesis ideas 
to broader software development tasks beyond green-field software creation. 
 As we will see later, there are a number of compelling applications of program synthesis in support of the broader
 software development process.

          <h3>Article body copy</h3>
          <p>It was a cool spring morning on British Columbia’s Vancouver Island when the ground began to buckle and heave. On the Richter scale, the earthquake reached a magnitude of 7.3 at a place called Forbidden Plateau. Seventy-five years later, it still holds the title as the most powerful onshore quake ever recorded in Canada. In nearby communities, brick walls fell and three-quarters of all chimneys collapsed. Two casualties were recorded that day: one man died of heart failure and another drowned after his dinghy was overturned by a wave generated when a piece of land gave way and thundered into the sea. For a while, that seemed like the end of the story. But over time, the changes wrought by the quake revealed a mystery that had lain hidden for generations—long enough to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Twenty-two kilometers from the quake’s epicenter, locals started noticing wooden stakes appearing in the intertidal zone of Comox Harbour on the east side of Vancouver Island. They ranged in size from the width of an adult’s thumb to the width of an arm, but stuck out little more than ankle high from the sand and mud. Locals pondered the mystery; many assumed they were the leavings of some relatively recent industrial activity, or a fishing scheme abandoned by immigrants from Japan.</p>
<p>In 2002, Nancy Greene, then an undergraduate anthropology student, walked among the barnacle-encrusted stakes and thought she’d found a fascinating subject for her senior project at Malaspina College (now Vancouver Island University). She had lived in the area since 1978, raised her children here, and was up for a new challenge. Little did she know it would consume countless hours, span more than a decade, or eventually reveal the largest unstudied archaeological feature yet found on the Pacific Northwest coast—one that would tell a remarkable tale of human ingenuity and adaptation in an era of climate change.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On the eastern slopes of the Beaufort Range, rain and meltwater flow down the Puntledge and Tsolum Rivers and converge in the Courtenay River before reaching Comox Harbour. These sheltered waters are part of the Salish Sea, which stretches from British Columbia’s Inside Passage down to Washington State’s Puget Sound. People have been living off the bounty of this marine environment ever since they began arriving in the region near the end of the last ice age, about 13,000 years ago. Comox Harbour lies within the protected waters of a broad, gently sloping estuary that covers an area of 9.6 square kilometers, slightly bigger than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. It is the traditional territory of speakers of the extinct Pentlatch language, whose descendants form part of the 342-member K’ómoks First Nation, which along with the communities of Courtenay and Comox now surround the harbor.</p>

<p>There had always been a few bits of wood poking up through the sand and mud of Comox Harbour, but after the quake of 1946, thousands of stakes emerged across vast stretches of the intertidal zone. This was likely a result of liquefaction, a phenomenon in which shaking reduces the strength of the sediment and leads to erosion. Subsequent periods of dredging near the mouth of the river may have also contributed to the process. It was clear the stakes formed patterns, but just what those patterns represented was a puzzle until quite recently. In her interviews with members of local Indigenous communities, Nancy Greene found only one clue: a K’ómoks elder said that her grandmother told her the stakes were used to catch salmon, and that families owned specific weirs and were tasked with maintaining them.</p>
<p>Cory Frank, manager of the K’ómoks Guardian Watchmen, encountered the stakes as a child and also pondered the mystery. But when he asked his elders what they were, they didn’t seem to know. What was well known were the frequent battles that took place in the harbor before colonization. Those foolish enough to attempt a raid on the people living here, or their rich resources, faced harsh consequences. “What we did with people like that was chop their heads off, put them on a spear, toss them in the sand, and leave them as a reminder for other people not to come.”</p>
<p>Frank clearly relishes relaying the tale, a testament to the abundance of salmon and the tenacity of the people protecting their claim to Comox Harbour. Now, as the history of the stakes is becoming known, he says they are a source of pride in his community.</p>

<p>Uncovering that history required hands-on research. In 2003, after surveying the entire estuary, Greene pulled on her gumboots and set out with pin flags and a laser theodolite to take geolocations of stakes across an area encompassing a total of approximately 30 hectares. She enlisted her husband, retired geologist David McGee, and a team of volunteers to help find and mark the stakes while trying to outrun the incoming tide. Because not all tides are created equal, she had to account for variations in how much area a tide exposed, available light, and weather. After months of reconnaissance, then weeks of recording geolocations, she recalls that first moment seeing the information they had collected displayed on a computer screen. Suddenly, those individual nubs of Douglas fir and western red cedar became 900 little black points on a field of white—like a photographic negative of stars in the nighttime sky. Patterns began to emerge and repeat. It took months of analysis, she says, before she began to realize what they represented—the remains of an immense, highly coordinated, and sophisticated fish trap system, the largest such system discovered in North America, if not the world.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Think Hotel California for fish—they can easily check in, but they can never leave. Such is the purpose of fish traps, ingenious systems for catching wild fish and practicing fishery management the world over. Fish weirs, like the ones that appeared in Comox Harbour, are a specific kind of fish trap built as an obstruction across a river or tidal waters. Fish seeking shallows, or spawning grounds farther upstream, swim in with the tide and can’t escape. The ancient technology relied on a deep and intimate knowledge of local fish behavior.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that complex hunter-gatherer cultures around the world invented fish traps independently at different places and times. Unlike wooden stakes, rock assemblages used in other fish weirs are difficult to date, but radiocarbon dating of adjacent middens (piles of fish bones and shells) offers a kind of proxy. Some of the oldest confirmed traps in North America are on mainland British Columbia at the mouth of the Fraser River (4,500 to 5,280 years old) and in Maine (5,770 years old). The oldest-known fish traps, between 9,000 and 7,000 years old, were found in northern Europe. But the technology is probably far older. A line of stones found on the shore of an ancient lake in the Kenya Rift is reminiscent of the fish weirs used by the local people in modern times. It dates to the time of <em>Homo erectus</em> or at least 490,000 years ago. If this was indeed a weir, it would mean the technology predates modern humans.</p>

<p>The scale and complexity of the fish weirs found in Comox Harbour is staggering. Multiple traps were likely in use at the same time and, collectively, would catch immense quantities of fish. Over the course of her research, published in the <em>Canadian Journal of Archaeology </em>in 2015, Greene and her team recorded the position of 13,602 stakes. Radiocarbon dating of 57 stakes revealed ages ranging from 1,300 to just over 100 years old. Greene, now a research archaeologist, conservatively estimates there are approximately 150,000 to 200,000 stakes in the harbor, which represent the remains of more than 300 fish traps. She knows of no other site approaching this scale of stake density.</p>
<p>In Comox Harbour, the patterns of the stake alignments reveal two distinct designs: one heart-shaped and one chevron-shaped. In both designs, removable lattice panels were likely lashed to the stakes to act as fences designed to lead the fish into the traps during high tide. When migrating fish encountered the barrier, they were directed into an opening at the crease between either the lobes of the heart or the wings of the chevron. As the tide receded, the fish inside the trap were stranded. The heart-shaped design mirrors historical fish weirs found in other sites along the Pacific Northwest coast, the east coast of North America, and coasts in other parts of the world. Depending on the height of the tide, the traps could have also served as holding ponds to keep fish alive in shallow water until people were ready to collect and process the catch. After the people had all they wanted, they removed the panels to allow fish to pass.</p>
<p>The stakes from the heart-shaped traps correspond with the earlier dates returned from radiocarbon dating. They ranged in age from 1,240 years old to a little over 840 years old. Because of their proximity to nearby middens, and the preponderance of herring bones in those middens, Greene suggests the people of Comox Harbour used heart-shaped traps to catch herring. They built, operated, and maintained those traps during a prolonged era of warm temperatures and frequent droughts—an era that was coming to an end.</p>
<div id="attachment_35987"><p><a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/shapes2-fish-trap-people.png"></a></p><p>The people changed the shape of the fish traps to adapt to changing ocean conditions. Illustration by David McGee and Mercedes Minck</p></div>
<p>On the east coast of Vancouver Island, there was a marked increase in precipitation around 850 years ago. As the air got cooler and ocean temperatures dropped, fish ranges shifted. The archaeological record reflects these changes. After using and maintaining the heart-shaped traps for over four centuries, local people abruptly replaced them with the chevron-shaped design. Greene found no evidence of a period of trial and error. Knowledge of this new design probably already resided within the local population, or they quickly obtained it. “There were heart-shaped traps, and then there were chevron-shaped traps,” she says. “There were no traps in between.” It was a rapid technological adaptation to an altered climate.</p>
<p>The new chevron-shaped traps, which worked on the same principle of corralling schooling fish into a holding pen, were designed to catch much larger fish—up to 30 times the mass of herring. Local people built the traps to take advantage of a species multiplying exponentially in the cooler temperatures, a species that would come to support the very foundation, stability, and fluorescence of culture in Comox Harbour and all along the Pacific Northwest coast—a complex and sophisticated society that did not rely on agriculture. For the next five centuries, the people of Comox Harbour expanded, rebuilt, and maintained those traps for catching salmon.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Construction of the fish traps began above the high-tide line in the temperate rainforest. The people of Comox Harbour selected saplings then cut, trimmed, and pointed them. They waited for a favorable low tide, then measured, spaced, and drove the stakes into the intertidal sand and mud using pile drivers before the tide came rolling back in. Examples of pile drivers from the Pacific Northwest coast include some with handles and others with ergonomic thumb and finger grips etched into the stone. They repeated the process dozens of times, likely over numerous tide cycles, in order to create a single chevron-shaped salmon trap. Once the stakes were secure and the lattice panels were lashed in place—but before any salmon were taken—tradition dictates the people would pay respect.</p>
<p>At the waters’ edge, a shaman would stand on a platform with his face painted red and eagle down in his hair—a symbol of peace and welcome. He would shake his ceremonial rattle and sing, then head out in his canoe. He would harpoon several salmon and put aside the first one he caught. The entire community would stand on the beach and watch, anticipating his return. When he came ashore, he would sing to and honor the first salmon by sprinkling it with eagle down. Once it was cooked and the feast complete, fishing could begin.</p>
<p></p>
<div id="attachment_36000"><p></p><p>There are hundreds of thousands of stakes in the Comox Harbour; Greene and her colleagues mapped a few thousand. Illustrations by David McGee and Mercedes Minck</p></div>
<p>As salmon arrived in the harbor, in search of the freshwater surge from the Courtenay River and the spawning sites upstream, some encountered wooden panels that formed a barrier forcing them through the narrow opening of a trap. One by one, the salmon followed each other inside, where they found themselves directed back along the wings of the pen, unable to escape.</p>
<p>During the salmon run, numerous fish traps would be in operation around the harbor. Men of high-status or lineage probably controlled access to the traps. Traditionally, in cultures along the Pacific Northwest coast, men were responsible for catching fish. Women and young children most often processed fish; slaves, who were considered genderless, were also likely given this task. The traps worked day and night, in concert with the tide, until either the salmon run subsided, or the people had their fill. They would then remove the panels and store them for the next run or season.</p>
<p>The people of Comox Harbour designed their traps to be semi-permanent. This allowed for the selective catch of salmon while the panels were in place; once the panels were removed, the rest of the fish could easily pass between the bare stakes to spawn in the rivers and streams beyond. An example of just such a panel, nearly six meters long and radiocarbon dated to the late 14th century, was discovered in Comox Harbour. The traps were highly consistent in form and were likely built using standardized units of measurement. One series of three linked traps, which may have been in use at the same time, stretched over a distance of more than three football fields (320 meters). The traps ensured both the fish and the fishery thrived.</p>
<div id="attachment_35978"><p><a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/panel-fish-trap-people.jpg"></a></p><p>The remains of a removable fence were found in the harbor a few years ago. Photo courtesy of Genevieve Hill</p></div>
<p>Greene suspects the fishery in and around Comox Harbour would have supported a high population density. She believes the enormous number of fish caught and processed here would go to feeding not only the local people over the coming winter months; they likely traded fish up and down the coast and across the Salish Sea. Prior to the smallpox epidemic of 1862, there were about 30,000 Indigenous people living along the coast of British Columbia’s Inside Passage. The fishery at Comox Harbour may have been the center of cultural activity in the northern Salish Sea for at least 1,300 years.</p>
<p>Deidre Cullon, an archaeologist and adjunct professor in the geography department at Vancouver Island University, works for the Laich-Kwil-Tach Treaty Society. She has studied Pacific Northwest fish traps and wrote her doctoral dissertation on the relationship between Pacific Northwest peoples and salmon. “What I find,” she says, “is that the more we do and the more we learn, the more questions we have.”</p>
<p>Cullon, like Greene, found it challenging to obtain any information about historical fish traps in the Indigenous communities she surveyed. Why has the cultural memory of these features and this technology all but vanished? She points to a “perfect storm” blowing out the flame of cultural memory.</p>
<p>The smallpox epidemic of 1862 claimed the lives of half the Indigenous people on the coast of British Columbia. In that catastrophe, not only were keepers of knowledge lost; entire communities were abandoned. Lost, too, was the need for a high-production fishery—there were far fewer mouths to feed.</p>
<p>“And then, right on the heels of that, the Canadian government chose to support commercial fishing for canneries,” Cullon explains. The government declared the traps illegal and sent their fisheries officers to destroy them. This was followed by the advent of the notorious residential school system, in which Indigenous children were removed from their families by the government and religious institutions and taken to far-off boarding schools, effectively separating them from their communities, language, and culture. This resulted in a profound disruption in the transfer of traditional knowledge, including the purpose and use of fish traps.</p>
<div id="attachment_35979"><p><a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/posts-fish-trap-people.jpg"></a></p><p>As the tide recedes in the harbor today, remains of the stakes poke out of the estuary. Photo courtesy of Nancy Greene</p></div>
<p>Although the ways and means of fishing changed, salmon retained their place at the heart of Indigenous society on the Pacific Northwest coast. Among many First Nations on this coast, it was taboo to toss salmon remains on a rubbish heap, as was done with herring and shellfish. People released the remains of salmon into the sea out of respect for what they considered nonhuman kin.</p>
<p>“The ocean was the water of life,” Cullon explains. “It had resurrection properties that allowed them to be reincarnated so that they can then return to the human world the following year.” In the Indigenous belief system, this respect and these traditions ensured the salmon’s return.</p>
<p>But for over a generation now, the number of salmon returning to the coast of British Columbia has fallen sharply, due to more than a century of commercial fishing and development. In addition, climate change is threatening the ecosystem itself. This strikes at the heart of both Indigenous communities and society as a whole. If not the continued return of the salmon, what will the future bring?</p>
<hr/>
<p>On the Pacific Northwest coast, and around the world, change is underway again. On a bright summer day in 2020, a fisherman hauled in evidence little more than 80 kilometers south of Comox Harbour. He was fishing for salmon but described his catch as “a meter long and all muscle and all teeth.” It was a Pacific barracuda, an aggressive, predatory species common in the subtropical waters off Baja California, over 2,000 kilometers to the south. William Cheung, the Canada Research Chair in Ocean Sustainability and Global Change at the University of British Columbia, says that warmer-water fish, such as barracuda and ocean sunfish are arriving in local waters with increasing frequency. He predicts a future in which sardines, a fish more associated with Southern California, will become common on Canada’s west coast.</p>
<p>Cheung’s research also opens a window into the past. He can corroborate the shift in ocean surface temperatures approximately 850 years ago, temperatures that favored salmon. And now, he sees another shift underway. After centuries of relative stability, ocean surface temperatures will likely continue to rise on the coast of British Columbia over the next 30 years. His projections suggest this warming will bring a 30 percent decline in sockeye salmon, but that’s only part of the story. Episodic marine heatwave events, such as the Blob, will exacerbate this baseline temperature increase—doubling the impact on fish like salmon.</p>
<p>Cheung says the temperature increases he’s seeing now are resulting in changes that are beyond what people have experienced before. He’s concerned that adapting to those changes will be less straightforward in the future. What’s certain is that unprecedented change in the global marine ecosystem is taking place, and human-induced climate change is one of the primary drivers.</p>
<p>The archaeological record shows the people of Comox Harbour used and adapted their fishing technology to help provide a nutritious food source and to ensure the sustainability of natural systems. They organized their society around it. Today, as climate change accelerates, and we continue the exploitation of global fish stocks to or beyond their capacity, modern society is leaving evidence of our commercial fishing philosophy in intertidal zones, on beaches, and adrift on and littering the bottom of the sea—much of it plastic. But on British Columbia’s central coast, just north of Vancouver Island, the Heiltsuk Nation is looking back to a traditional technology to help safeguard the future of their fishery.</p>
<div id="attachment_35980"><p><a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/intertidal-fish-trap-people.jpg"></a></p><p>The fish traps extend over the 9.6-square-kilometer harbor. Photo courtesy of Nancy Greene</p></div>
<p>William Housty, conservation manager for the Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Department, says evidence of ancient stone fish traps and cedar stake fish weirs is found throughout Heiltsuk territory.</p>
<p>“It’s not like throwing a net in the water and catching every salmon that’s swimming by,” he says of the old traps and weirs. They represent what he calls a brilliant technological approach because they were adapted on a creek-by-creek basis, which allowed for intimate knowledge and management focused on sustainability. Now, he says, the technology has proved to be invaluable for research.</p>
<p>Today, biologists commonly use weirs for monitoring fishery health, but the technology is rarely used in the Indigenous territories where it evolved. In 2013, the Heiltsuk Nation built a fish weir, based on a traditional design, on the Koeye River, an important salmon-bearing stream. It has allowed local people to identify, tag, and release salmon; to understand critical relationships between rates of salmon survival and spawning; and to monitor stream temperature fluctuations—in short, to assess the health of the ecological system.</p>
<p>“I think it’s genius,” Housty says of the technology that has a history of being adaptable to climate change. “One, to be able to feed yourself; two, to be able to maintain ecological diversity in the watersheds and stream systems; and three, just being mindful and respectful of the salmon themselves and making sure that we’re giving them the opportunity to spawn and come back—knowing full well that, in previous times, salmon were the main staple of our ancestors.”</p>
<p>The salmon caught in the new Heiltsuk weir are not yet used for food or ceremonial purposes. That will only happen once local managers are confident sustainability objectives have been met. Housty looks forward to that day. When it arrives, he says the first fish taken will be welcomed with honor and respect.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>If geographers “carve,” “draw,” or “write” the earth, psychogeographers add a zest of soul to the mix, linking earth, mind and foot.</p><figure><figcaption>Cover of Guy Debord&#39;s 1957 “Psychogeographic guide of Paris.&#34; The territory is fragmented and depicts only the emotional connections of different places.</figcaption></figure><p>“Psychogeography is the fact that you have an opinion about a space the moment you step into it,” says the writer and psychogeographer Wilfried Hou Je Bek. “This has as much to do with the space as with our hardwired instincts to determine if it is safe.”</p><p><em>Graphy </em>comes from the Greek <em>graphein </em>(to write), a decidedly polysemic word. If geographers “carve,” “draw,” or “write” the earth (<em>geos</em>), what about psychogeographers? The Latin prefix <em>psyche </em>(breath) adds a zest of soul to the mix, linking earth, mind and foot. Psychogeographic writing can be thought of as an alternative way of reading the city. Wilfried Hou Je Bek calls it “the city-space cut-up.” Just as William Burroughs and Brion Gysin cut and reorganized newspaper texts to reveal their implicit content, so too psychogeographers decode urban space by moving through it in unexpected ways.</p><p>Although the various practices gathered under the umbrella of psychogeography are ancient, the term itself was first used by members of the Lettrist International, a Paris-based collective of radical artists and cultural theorists that was active in the early 1950s. They described it as “a science of relations and ambiances” they were developing “to give play in the society of others [<em>le jeu de société</em>; literally, “the parlor game”] its true meaning: a society founded upon play. Nothing is more serious. Amusement is the royal privilege that must be made available to everyone.”</p><p>Writing in the Belgian surrealist journal <em>Les Lèvres Nues, </em>Guy-Ernest Debord attributes the term to an “illiterate Kabyle.” Its vagueness appealed to the loosely organized group that adopted it to describe its various activities. Because geography deals with the impact of natural forces (such as climate and soil composition) “on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world,” wrote Debord, psychogeography should examine the “specific effects of the geographical environment . . . on the emotions and behavior of individuals.” To accomplish this ambitious investigation, he and his friends <a href="http://www.notbored.org/la-carte.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recommended drifting</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The practice of de-familiarization and the choice of encounters, the sense of incompleteness and ephemerality, the love of speed transposed onto the plane of the mind, together with inventiveness and forgetting are among the elements of an ethics of drifting we have already begun to test in the poverty of the cities of our time.</p></blockquote><p>Contemporary practitioners take their cue from Debord, who proposed one of psychogeography’s first genealogies. It began with Giovanni Piranesi’s <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/362676" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">labyrinthine stairways</a> and gathered Claude Lorrain, Jack the Ripper (“<a href="http://www.notbored.org/exercise.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">probably psycho-geographical in love</a>”), Edgar Allan Poe, and André Breton (deemed “naively psycho-geographical in encounters”), among others.</p><p>Each psychogeographer has his own list: Ralph Rumney’s included “Renaissance architect Serlio, French garden designer Le Nôtre, and all builders of grottoes, follies and mazes”; Iain Sinclair turns to William Blake, “the Godfather of Psychogeography”; Rebecca Solnit makes a case for satirist John Gay, the author of “Trivia, or The Art of Walking the Streets of London”<em> </em>(1716); Wilfried Hou Je Bek singles out Horace Walpole, who, over a period of 30 years, transformed his Tudor mansion into a Gothic castle “meticulously designed to provoke a vast array of sensations in its visitors”; Merlin Coverly cites Robert Louis Stevenson’s “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”<em> </em>for the way it depicts the seamy underside of the city as reflecting dark corners of the human psyche.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“On Saturday evenings,” wrote opium-eater and peripatetic Thomas de Quincey, “I have had the custom, after taking my opium, of wandering quite far, without worrying about the route or the distance.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Among the precursors found on nearly every list is <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/exploring-drug-induced-synesthesia/">opium-eater and peripatetic Thomas de Quincey</a>: “On Saturday evenings,” wrote de Quincey, “I have had the custom, after taking my opium, of wandering quite far, without worrying about the route or the distance” in search of an occult “Northwest Passage” allowing one to cross London unhampered.</p><h4>The Figure of the Flâneur</h4><p>Charles Baudelaire’s flâneur is often cited as a model for today’s run of psychogeographer. Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s story “The Man of the Crowd” and epitomized by Baudelaire’s painter friend Constantin Guys, the flâneur was something of a dandy who ambled through the Paris arcades while ordinary people scurried to work all around him. Free from the pressures of the workaday world, he sought the random encounters that the city streets were always ready to offer.</p><p>Guys, “the painter of modern life,” was a man of the world whose domain was the crowd, “just as the air is the bird’s and water that of the fish.” He desired nothing more than to merge with the throng and to dwell in “the ebb and flow, the bustle, the fleeting and the infinite,” Baudelaire wrote in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Le-Peintre-de-la-vie-moderne" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an essay</a> on the painter.  The crowd was “[a]n enormous reservoir of electricity” that gave him the opportunity “to be away from home and yet to feel at home anywhere; to see the world, to be at the very center of the world, and yet to be unseen by the world” to the extent that the man himself has become a mirror, “a kaleidoscope endowed with consciousness,” “an ego thirsting for the nonego and reflecting it at every moment in energies more vivid than life itself, always inconstant and fleeting.” Baudelaire completes this portrait in “The Crowds,” one of the prose poems that comprise “Le Spleen de Paris” (“Paris Spleen”): “It is not given to everyone to be able to bathe in the multitude: enjoyment of the crowd is an art” that requires “a taste for dressing up and masque, a hatred for domesticity and a passion for travel. The solitary and thoughtful stroller derives a singular intoxication from this universal communion.”</p><p>In the 1930s, Walter Benjamin reappropriated Baudelaire’s dandy for his own purposes, contrasting “the pedestrian who wedged himself into the crowd” with “the flâneur who demanded elbow room and was unwilling to forgo the life of the gentleman of leisure.” He claimed that “Around 1840 it was briefly fashionable to take turtles for a walk in the arcades. The flâneurs liked to have the turtles set the pace for them” as a way of protesting against “the division of labor which makes people into specialists.”</p><p>In the tradition of Restif de la Bretonne, who wandered through Paris on the eve of the French Revolution (“Les nuits de Paris,” 1788–1794), Benjamin’s contemporaries Louis Aragon (“Paris Peasant,” 1925), André Breton (“Nadja,” 1928), and Philippe Soupault <em>(</em>“Last Nights of Paris,” 1928) put to paper their citywide ramblings. Like Baudelaire, they celebrated the inadvertent poetry of shop window displays, fleeting glances, elusive women, chance encounters, and mysterious pursuits.</p><hr/><p>Drifting for members of the Lettrist International did not mean only walking. The adventure began during a transportation strike in the summer of 1953 on the platform at the Gare de Lyon, where the group was trying agit-prop. Failing to rally any of the stranded passengers to the strikers’ cause, Guy Debord, Jean-Michel Mension, and their friends sauntered out of the station (or were they chased out?) and began flagging down cars. Hitchhiking nonstop through Paris, they changed their destinations to fit that of the drivers. Their goal, as Debord noted facetiously, was to add to the confusion.</p><p>Later, this “technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances” was accomplished on foot and by taxi, “depending on whether the goal [was] to study a terrain or to emotionally disorient oneself.” In “Dérive<em> </em>by the Mile,” Michèle Bernstein, a novelist and a founding member of the Situationist International, argued in favor of replacing private transport in Paris with large numbers of low-cost taxis, which would be more conducive to recreational drifting. As they travel varying distances in a set time and follow an essentially random itinerary, taxis combine freedom of movement with automatic disorientation.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The situationists prided themselves on detecting the “sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Conversely, walking was better for close-up views that focus on the environment at hand. The situationists prided themselves on detecting the “sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres,” as Debord wrote in “<a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/urbgeog.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography</a>.” It is a subjective science. When Guy Debord <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/twoaccounts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">describes</a> the urban ambiances that he and fellow lettrist Gil J. Wolman gathered while drifting through the north of Paris, his judgments are peremptory: Here he sees a “repulsive <em>petit-bourgeois </em>landscape”; there he deems a staircase leading to a network of alleys to be “annoyingly picturesque”; farther on, he consecrates “the impressive rotunda by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux” as the center of an “important psycho-geographic hub” because it is “a virtual ruin left in an incredible state of abandonment, whose charm is singularly enhanced by the curve of the elevated subway line that passes by at close distance.”</p><p>A drift could last as long as the drifters wanted it to — a whole day or, as Debord suggests in his “Theory of the Drift,” the time between two periods of sleep:</p><blockquote><p>The maximum area of this spatial field does not extend beyond the entirety of a large city and its suburbs. At its minimum it can be limited to a small self-contained ambiance: a single neighborhood or even a single block of houses if it’s interesting enough (the extreme case being a static-drift of an entire day within the Saint-Lazare train station).</p></blockquote><p>It comprised both restless movement and alcohol-fueled talk. Speaking in Paris at the Palais de Tokyo in September 2003, Jean-Michel Mension described those early drifts as leading frequently from one neighborhood bar to another. It was not usually a solitary pursuit. Debord’s and Wolman’s drift began at 10 a.m. and finished at an unspecified time in the evening when the two drifters abruptly decided to put an end to it. On the way, they made a number of “stops — sometimes long, sometimes brief — at various bars patronized by the bargemen” on the right bank of the canal Saint-Denis, before arriving in a Spanish bar known as the Tavern of the Rebels.</p><p>In recent decades, for poachers and protesters, artists, activists and drifters, walking has emerged as a means of reclaiming public space. From the Paris suburbs to London’s ring road, pedestrians are reappearing (or springing up) in spaces dedicated to automobile traffic. For many of them walking is a process of self-education.</p><h4><strong>Remaking the World?</strong></h4><p>What is psychogeography’s legacy? In its diverse forms, it embodies the desire to renew language, social life, and oneself. For contemporary psychogeographers, the drift is purposeful; it can reveal the city’s underlying structure. Iain Sinclair aims for Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “alert reverie,” a kind of double presence that is both in the here and now and in the imagination:</p><blockquote><p>Walking is the best way to explore and exploit the city; the changes, shifts, breaks in the cloud helmet, movement of light on water. Drifting purposefully is the recommended mode, trampling asphalted earth in alert reverie, allowing the fiction of an underlying pattern to assert itself. To the no-bullshit materialist this sounds suspiciously like fin de siècle decadence, a poetic of entropy — but the born-again flâneur is a stubborn creature, less interested in texture and fabric, eavesdropping on philosophical conversation pieces, than in noticing everything.</p></blockquote><p>In “Theory of the Drift,” Debord proposed the idea of a “possible rendezvous” as a means of “behavioral disorientation.” Here, a person is given an appointment at a particular time and place but has no idea if someone will be there to meet him or who that person is. Not knowing what to expect, he will study his surroundings and start conversations with passers-by: “He may meet no one, or he may even by chance meet the person who has arranged the ‘possible rendezvous.’ In any case, particularly if the time and place have been well chosen, his use of time will take an unexpected turn.”</p><p>Courting the unexpected is often combined with the unabashed apology of subjectivity. Stewart Home, the English artist and writer who in 1992 revived the London Psychogeographical Association, states: “For me photography is most alluring when both the person behind the lens and what is being photographed self-consciously manifest their subjectivity. Traveling across ‘Britain’ to discover ‘America’ is only one of the many ways in which such subjectivity might remake the world in both photographic and material form. . . . The psychogeographer . . . knows that the world cannot be recorded, it can only be remade.” “Remaking the world” is usually done in smoke-filled cafés. If these debates rarely lead to concrete action, what about walking?</p><hr/><p><em><strong>Karen O’Rourke </strong>is an artist and emeritus professor at Jean Monnet University Saint-Etienne, France, and the author of “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/walking-and-mapping" target="_blank">Walking and Mapping</a>,” from which this article is adapted.

      <title>Show HN: Object Detection in an Hour</title>
      <link>https://www.strayrobots.io/blog/object-detection-in-an-hour</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_strayrobots_io_blog_object-detection-in-an-hour/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><div><p>August 7, 2021</p><div><p>Building object detection models can be very painful. If you are lucky, a pretrained <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">YOLOv3</a> or <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/">Detectron2</a> model will work just fine. Oftentimes you will need a class that does not exist in an existing dataset or you need to further tune the models for your specific operating conditions and sensors. While setting up a model and pipeline requires some computer vision and machine learning knowledge, collecting and annotating the training data is still by far the most work intensive part of the process.</p><p>To train a model, you will need thousands of examples, preferably hundreds of thousands from your specific domain. This can easily mean weeks of manual person hours of work.</p><p>By using the right tools, this time can be cut down from days to hours (or in our case a single lunch break).</p><p>Here we describe how we used the Stray software stack to create a custom electric scooter detection system in just an hour of active time.</p><h3>Data collection</h3><figure><p></p><figcaption>Ken capturing footage of a scooter using the Stray Scanner app</figcaption></figure><p>We figured that electric scooters which have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-scooter-vandalism-20180809-story.html">taken over cities worldwide</a>, would serve as a perfect example of an object detection target. The resulting detector could be used in a robot that puts them where they belong. It&#39;s also a great example of an object that does not have a corresponding category in the popular <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO dataset</a>, which is often used to pre-train and evaluate many of the popular object detection models.</p><p>In order to train a custom object detection model, the amount of data needs to be in the order of thousands, preferably tens of thousands of images. This amounts to a few minutes of video data at 30-60 fps. It is important to capture the target in many different conditions and from all viewpoints, so it makes sense to capture many short clips with different contexts instead of a single video from the same context.</p><p>Fortunately, finding electric scooters in different contexts was not an issue for us, since the path to our lunch place was paved with dozens of scooters. We went ahead and captured a dataset of all the scooters we encountered using the Stray Scanner app. The app captures RGB and depth frames at 60fps. In total, we recorded 25 different clips which sums up to a total of about 15 000 images.</p><p>While we used the <a href="https://www.strayrobots.io/products/scanner">Stray Scanner</a> app, any RGB-D sensor can be used that creates both an RGB frame and a depth map.</p><h3>From raw video to annotated data</h3><figure><p></p><figcaption>The Stray Studio 3D annotation tool</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we would typically load the data into an annotation tool such as <a href="https://www.makesense.ai/">MakeSense</a> or <a href="https://superannotate.com/">SuperAnnotate</a> and begin a tedious process of labeling images one by one, adding bounding boxes or segmentation masks that cover the objects. Alternatively, we could send the images to a manual labeling service such as <a href="https://segments.ai/">Segments.ai</a>, but the costs can pile up really quickly, depending on the size of the dataset and annotation type.</p><p>To avoid this, we import the collected data from the Stray Scanner app into our <a href="https://docs.strayrobots.io/formats/data.html">data format</a>. We integrate the frames into a 3D reconstruction and extract camera poses using the Stray Command Line Tool with the simple stray studio integrate command. The output is the trajectory of the camera and a triangle mesh representing the scene in 3D, which we can open in the Stray Studio interface.</p><p>In Stray Studio, we can place bounding boxes and keypoints in 3D space. Once we are happy with the 3D annotations, we can project the bounding boxes and keypoints back onto each 2D images from which the scene was constructed. Annotating in 3D additionally allows us to compute 3D labels, in each image&#39;s coordinate frame, which is useful for solving 3D computer vision tasks.</p><p>Getting to this point in the process has taken us about an hour of active work, several orders of magnitude less than what it would have taken us, had we labeled each image one by one.</p><h3>Data loading and model training</h3><p>The desired labels do not need to be produced and exported in advance, but instead we can configure the desired label type (bounding box, segmentation mask) come model training time. For our electric scooter detection, we chose to use the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/">Detectron2</a> library. The Stray Command Line Interface provides easy to use utilities for model definition and <a href="https://docs.strayrobots.io/commands/model.html#stray-model-bake">baking</a> (i.e. fine tuning and training, check out the <a href="https://docs.strayrobots.io/commands/model.html#stray-model-bake">documentation</a> for further details).</p><p>We train our model to detect 2D bounding boxes around the scooters from RGB images. The qualitative results shown above are after training for 25 000 <a href="https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/benchmarks.html">iterations</a> and evaluating on data not included in the training set. Even though the evaluation data is from a completely different context on a sunny day, the model generalizes well to different types of scooters and also is robust to the camera shaking and to scooters being partially occluded.</p><p>We are currently building the next round of demos, which will include extracting and infering semantic segmentation masks. Stay tuned for more in the upcoming weeks!</p><h3>Using the tool yourself</h3><p>We have made all the tools mentioned in this post available for everyone to use, free of charge for now. Install the tools by following our <a href="http://docs.strayrobots.io">installation guide</a>. Currently, we support macOS and Linux platforms.</p><p>Moving forward, we will be expanding our toolkit to make it even more powerful and versatile.</p><p>If you have a use case in mind, have improvement ideas or anything else in mind, we would very much like to hear from you!</p><p>Meanwhile, you should subscribe to our <a href="https://tinyletter.com/strayrobots">newsletter</a>, to follow us as we develop a simple to use toolkit for solving computer vision problems.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post explores the differences between software tools and services; how the stateful nature of software services led them to be closed; and posits how crypto networks can catalyze a new era of open services that reignite combinatorial innovation.</em></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Before the ubiquity of internet services (search, maps, social, commerce), software was more similar in its nature to tools (word processing, spreadsheets, graphics editing).</p>
<p>Because of the permissionless nature of open source code, software tools benefitted from combinatorial innovation and evolved quickly.</p>
<p>Internet services use software tools (like databases) as their building blocks, but also provide new and advanced functionality that tools aren’t capable of. They are dynamic, social, and collaborative in ways tools are not. A service’s reliance on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a> makes it fundamentally different than a tool. A service’s software, when instantiated, creates a vessel for persisting state. It starts off empty and becomes useful only when filled with data, users or both.</p>
<p>The business model of internet services is predicated on monetizing state. State is a competitive advantage, and is defended by keeping services proprietary and closed. Further combinatorial innovation of services is restricted because outside developers can’t benefit from true composability of existing services and their underlying data.</p>
<p>DNS, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">phonebook of the internet</a>, while limited in capability, is one of a handful examples of a successful early open internet service that resulted in a lot of downstream innovation. Because of incompatible incentives, there are no open internet services today that come close to the complexity or utility of dominant closed ones.</p>
<p>That’s where crypto comes in. Crypto networks rely on open source code, but also instantiate global services that depend on open state. Open state is a critical requirement for cryptographic verification and provides the lynchpin of trust in blockchains. In addition, tokens create a new incentive model for sustaining crypto networks that is aligned with their open nature.</p>
<h2>Conditions for innovation</h2>
<p>Combinatorial innovation is a cultural process for invention by which existing ideas are combined in novel ways to create new ideas. The resulting output is fed back into the process to generate more new ideas, ad infinitum. As more ideas are explored, more possibilities present themselves.</p>
<p>Take the analogy of a garden: A healthy garden requires room for growth, ample light, regular watering, and an attentive gardener. Similar prerequisites exist for robust combinatorial innovation: A healthy landscape where a diverse set of products and services can grow.</p>
<p>First, a community of inventors must be <strong>interconnected</strong> through communication technology (language, writing) so ideas can flow widely and efficiently. The presence of a culture of <strong>sharing</strong> allows ideas to be challenged and refined (scientific method, peer review), and for the strongest ones to rise to the top.</p>
<p>Participation in a global marketplace for ideas (capitalism) provides the <strong>incentives</strong> for inventors to compete, driving innovation.</p>
<p>But all of these together are complex systems. Complex technology naturally leads to <strong>modularity</strong>. Specialists subdivide and conquer that complexity to improve the building blocks, creating fractal competition.</p>
<p>Software is the ultimate environment for combinatorial innovation, excelling in all dimensions at an unprecedented scale: The internet is the ultimate connectivity network. Open source culture continuously refines modules of code. And billions of users with interconnected devices present an unprecedented addressable market.</p>
<h2>Software tools: the user is in control</h2>
<p>In some ways, software tools are not unlike the products of the industrial era. Like a manufacturing tool, they carry out a particular function, useful in and of itself.</p>
<p>In fact, early software predominantly produced better digital versions of industrial information and media processing tools:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software tool</th>
<th>Industrial tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Word processor (WordPerfect)</td>
<td>Typewriter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spreadsheet (Excel)</td>
<td>Accounting book</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Graphics editor (Photoshop)</td>
<td>Darkroom</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Later, as computers became more affordable, ubiquitous and interconnected by the internet, a new breed of service-like software emerged, enabling new modes of communication, collaboration and interaction, upending the top-down models of production and distribution in media industries, and also bringing forth new implications for power and control.</p>
<p>All tool-like software has certain key properties:</p>
<p>It is <strong>self contained</strong>. Run the code and it’ll do what is promised. There are no external dependencies. Word processor software, for example, is so useful by itself that successful companies were built selling computers with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuX-6761KTQ">single purpose</a>.</p>
<p>It offers <strong>single player utility</strong>. Like a hammer that you own, you don’t need anything or anyone else to use it.</p>
<p>The <strong>user is the operator</strong>. There is a strong sense of ownership, even property, as well as control, for the user. It’s your personal tool, not a service you hire from someone else.</p>
<p>Copies are <strong>interchangeable</strong>. If you forget your laptop, you can borrow a friend’s and still retouch your pictures in their instance of Photoshop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the initial business model for tool-like software was selling licenses. Piracy naturally emerged, since the tools were so useful, but the code was also easy and inexpensive to copy and share. Piracy, in a sense, is natural to the combinatorial innovation process, since intellectual property is a barrier to the flow of ideas.</p>
<p>The open source community rapidly created openly-licensed alternatives to most proprietary software, free to reuse and modify. Since the idea of tool software is synonymous with its utility, anyone can attempt to create an alternate, open version from scratch (even though open source alternatives were often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP">inferior</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">proprietary</a> originals).</p>
<p>Next, as connectivity to the internet became commonplace and the web started to pick up steam, the focus of software innovation shifted from digital productivity tools to programming communication and interactivity between computers. Software edged toward offering new capabilities of being collaborative, multiplayer, dynamic, and social, in turn producing the building blocks for the next generation of software, internet services.</p>
<h2>Code vs state</h2>
<p>To understand the evolution, it is important to to distinguish between the <strong>logic</strong> (code) of a program and its <strong>ability to remember</strong> (state).</p>
<p>Early software was functional in nature—an input led to an output. A story in your mind is translated to a digital document with the aid of a word processor. A scanned photo is cropped and text is overlaid with image processing software.</p>
<p>The ability to remember preceding events or user interactions (state) was primitive and minimal. State input also only came from the single user of the program.</p>
<p>Internet services leveraged sophisticated state management, allowing them to provide unprecedented new utility.</p>
<h2>Internet services: users give up state</h2>
<p>Personal computing is defined by the idea that a user runs a <strong>personal</strong> instance of a program on <strong>their</strong> computer. The internet is defined by a new class of software centered around the concept of a <strong>shared</strong> service that runs on a <strong>remote</strong> server.</p>
<p>Instead of “one computer, one program”, where there are many identical instances of software run by independent individuals, one server operator (or company) runs a single instance of a program on their server (or datacenter). Lots of people connect to that service and interact with it over the internet.</p>
<p>Importantly, instead of a user maintaining their own state, a service maintains state on a user’s behalf.</p>
<p>This has important consequences. Power shifts away from the user and their private <a href="https://youtu.be/rTRzYjoZhIY">bicycle for the mind</a>. A new force of consolidation and control emerges. Ironically, the internet, a decentralized communication network, produced some of the most centralizing services in history.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the generic definition of “service”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a system supplying a public need such as transport, communications, or utilities such as electricity and water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Services are categorically different than tools.</p>

<p>Services thrive at scale, from both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale">economies of scale</a> (an industrial concept) and a new notion of stateful <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/">network effects</a>. They desire to be global and singular. They have long, continuous lifespans and operate autonomously. Like for services in the real world, a failure of an internet service is catastrophic for users that depend on it.</p>
<p>Users find more value in plugging into an existing service than from building their own, making them naturally become monopolies.</p>
<p>Services can be deployed in data centers, enabling applications to run at a scale that would be infeasible for a personal computer. Crawling the entire web is possible by a well funded and architected service.</p>
<h2>State gives services superpowers</h2>
<p>A user may interact with the service to address a personal need, for example, to find a certain website with the aid of a keyword query. The service satisfies that need by returning a list of results, but a byproduct of the user’s action is the service improving its global state. In the case of search, the user action updates the global ranking of the selected website in the system, improving results for all other users in the future. Even though users are using the service for a selfish reason, the service gets smarter and more useful for all users.</p>
<p>Over a service’s lifespan, the utility of its code begins to diverge with the utility of its state.</p>
<p>State compounds and becomes more valuable superlinearly. Code, while crucial for the stable operation and evolution of a service, becomes less important and necessary to defend.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that most services are primarily constructed out of open source components. Anyone can attempt to copy a service or even re-instantiate the actual codebase, but an existing service with more users will have more useful state, and will be more desirable to new users. This creates a feedback loop, where more users beget more state, leading to a more useful service that attracts further users and more state.</p>
<h2>From open source to open services</h2>
<p>As my partner Chris has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/">written</a>, we are seeing a great consolidation of internet services among a few corporations. Years of state accumulated by innovative companies produced tremendously useful services (search, maps, social, commerce), but further combinatorial innovation is off-limits to outside developers and entrepreneurs. Rebuilding services from scratch on the same terms and this late in the game is hopeless.</p>
<p>As crypto networks evolve, they are likely to provide strong incentives to unlock further state and create open services in many areas dominated by closed ones today. Open services powered by crypto networks will present unprecedented opportunity for a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to innovate.</p>

<p>And if you muster up the energy to make them, it’s a cycle of uploads and re-uploads till you get the right resolution, size and colors.</p>
<h3 id="figma-to-the-rescue">Figma to the Rescue</h3>
<p><a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a> is a design tool that’s used to make mockups. One feature built-into it is the ability to export your designs as an image.</p>
<p>So for most of my banners, and graphics and almost anything for the web, I make them Figma.</p>
<figure>
</figure>

<p>And everytime I make changes, I have to export the the picture out, and upload it.</p>
<p>If a size is incorrect, or a color is wrong, I have to drag it over and upload it somewhere else. That also means you get a bunch of the same assets called “image”, “image_copy_1”, “image_copy_2”.</p>
<h4 id="meet-figmage">Meet Figmage</h4>
<p>Taking this entire hassle out, you can now just get an image link directly to your design in Figma.</p>
<p>Integrating it is as easy as dropping the link in an image tag.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&#34;https://figmage.com/images/-wgliTMiWvjf3WPlpWzgA.png&#34; /&gt;
</code></pre><p>I built <a href="https://figmage.com/life">Figmage</a> to automatically uploads your designs from Figma into a cloud URL.</p>
<div>
<figure>
</figure>

</div>
<p>In fact, all of the images in this blog post live in a Figma file and have been uploaded to Figmage.</p>
<p>If Christmas rolls around, and I wanted every image to have a red background, I can make and publish the changes without even touching my website. The changes are seen in an instant.</p>
<p>My favorite part is that I can use it without ever leaving my browser.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-know">Things to Know</h3>
<p>I built Figmage’s image hosting using AWS Lambda and S3. And as a technology person, I have to call out the trade-offs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosted on Figmage.com</strong> -  The images are hosted with the figmage domain rather than your custom domain. Webflow does something similar. This may or may not work well with SEO for images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cold-Start</strong> - I’ve generally found that images take 200ms load. Which is the general response time for AWS Lambda. However, in a cold-start (e.g. nobody is using the service), it may take up-to 2 seconds to send an image. So for major assets that are critical to load (e.g. a background), I might not use Figmage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, you can always upload your final assets to a provider of your choice from Figma. You can use figmage as a playground for when you’re still experimenting with the right assets.</p>
<p>It’s also my first project that makes revenue, you can get a <a href="https://figmage.com/life">limited lifetime deal</a> for a 1000 images at $20.</p>

      <title>Apple&#39;s New CSAM Protections May Make iCloud Photos Bruteforceable</title>
      <link>https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93423/how-unique-is-a-neuralhash</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<p>I was doing some reading today about a major tech company planning to implement a new system for automatically detecting and reporting CSAM in users&#39; photos. Overall, the system as described in their 12-page technical summary seems to be designed quite well, and may be as close as you can get to true privacy, while still allowing for content surveillance.</p>
<p>That being said, the hacker in me can&#39;t help but feel a little alarmed when it hears about exceptions to what could otherwise be end-to-end encryption (not that their photo storage is advertised as end-to-end encrypted to begin with, however their technical overview does say that all of the photos are encrypted with a—<em>threshold breakable</em>—key randomly generated by the user&#39;s device). Therefore, I came here to outline what I see as the most realistic attack on the cryptographic strength/privacy guarantees of this system, and to (hopefully) learn why I am wrong or what I have overlooked.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let&#39;s say that this company ever suffers a data breach: an unlikely situation to begin with, but not unheard of. As a result of this data breach, many users&#39; photos (in encrypted format) are leaked. If true end-to-end encryption were in place, this would not be a major privacy concern, as all photos would be encrypted with a key known only to the end users&#39; devices, and therefore would not be realistically decryptable by anyone on the internet.</p>
<p>In this new system, however, it is my understanding that photos, or at least their <em>visual derivatives</em> (which I could not find a definition for though <strong>I&#39;m assuming</strong> is similar to thumbnails), are encrypted twice, with the outer layer being encrypted by a key derived from the NeuralHash of the photo.</p>
<h6>NeuralHash is described as a hashing algorithm capable of providing the same hash for the same image, even after that image has undergone cropping, resizing, color adjustments, compression, etc.</h6>
<p>To quote part of the Technical Summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of the hash is to ensure that identical and visually similar images result in the same hash, and images that are different from one another result in different hashes. For example, an image that has been slightly cropped or resized should be considered identical to its original and have the same hash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great in theory, because it means that all (presumably unique) photos taken by users will be encrypted with strong, unique secrets, keeping them private and secure.</p>
<p>But, what happens when a user stores a photo that isn&#39;t unique? For example a screenshot from a popular website, a meme circulating the internet, etc.? What&#39;s to stop an attacker from generating a NeuralHash of popular memes, deriving a key, then bruteforcing the leaked data until it successfully decrypts an entry, thus verifying the contents within a specific user&#39;s cloud photo library, and degrading their level of privacy?</p>
<p>Or, for another example, let&#39;s say the attacker <em>loves</em> apples, and really, really wants to find photos of apples. What&#39;s to stop them from having an AI generate a few million photos of an apple, hashing them, deriving keys, and then bruteforcing the presumably large leak until it finds a match? There can&#39;t be <em>that</em> many permutations of an apple, can there? Like sure, you&#39;re not going to find all of the apple photos, but I would think that you&#39;d be able to at least get <em>some</em> decryptable matches.</p>
<p>This company itself even reveals in one of its papers that there is a non-zero chance of false positives when it comes to matches, and that they&#39;ve therefore introduced threshold secret sharing (i.e. needing to have multiple matches to their &#34;known-bad&#34; database before their inner level of encryption can be broken... more on that next), to reduce the chance of false positives down to one in a trillion. A significantly less than a one in a trillion chance of having a false positive match on any, given photo sounds within bruteforceable range to me, especially if you already know what type of photo you&#39;re looking for.</p>
<p>On a final note, there is an inner layer of threshold encryption which basically requires that the outer layers of multiple photos be decrypted before the key to decrypt the inner layer can be constructed. But once again, depending on the threshold size (which must be quite low, as it needs to be less than a realistic amount of CSAM that someone could have), it doesn&#39;t seem like a large obstacle: you just need to find a user who has, say, ten common memes stored in their entire cloud photo storage library, and you&#39;ve now constructed that key. According to the paper, that same key is used across <em>all</em> of a user&#39;s photos for that first layer of encryption.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I see the security and privacy guarantees of this system in the event of a data breach hanging onto one, main thing: the NeuralHash.</p>
<p>If the NeuralHash has a high-enough false positive rate, and can be reverse engineered or gets leaked or is made public (if it isn&#39;t already), then can this major tech company truly guarantee its users that their private photos will unconditionally remain private, as long as they&#39;re not CSAM? What cryptographic protections have I overlooked, that make an attack like the one I described above impossible? What am I missing? Do you see any other potential flaws?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Update: I was not sure if it were considered acceptable or not to specifically name the company, so I decided to err on the side of caution and not do so. That being said, I did see a few comments asking for the source, so <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="CSAM Detection Technical Summary">here it is</a>. I hope this helps!</p>

      <title>Making Reasonable Use of Computer Resources</title>
      <link>https://vfoley.xyz/reasonable-use/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    

    
    <small>31 Jul 2021</small>
    <p>The computers sitting on our desks are incomprehensibly fast. They can perform more operations in one second than a human could in one hundred years. We live in an era of CPUs that can perform billions of instructions per second, tens of billions if we take multi-cores into account, of memory that can transfer data to the CPU at hundreds of gigabytes per second, of disks that support streaming reads of gigabytes per second. This era of incredibly fast hardware is also the era of programs that take tens of seconds to start from an SSD or NVMe disk; of bloated web applications that take many seconds to show a simple list, even on a broadband connection; of programs that process data at a thousandth of the speed we should expect. Software is laggy and sluggish — and the situation shows little signs of improvement. Why is that?</p>
<p>I believe that the main reason is that most of us who started programming after, say the year 2000, have never learned how to make <strong>reasonable use</strong> of the computational resources at our disposal. In fact, most of our training has taught us to ignore the computer!</p>
<p>Although our job is ostensibly to create programs that let users <strong>do stuff with their computers</strong>, we place a greater emphasis on the development process and dev-oriented concerns than on the final user product. SICP contains a quote that I find to be a good summarization of the problem: “programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Many programmers find that quote wise and inspiring, but users are not interested in reading programs, they’re interested in executing them, fast. We can’t make programs that run fast if we write them in a way that is only “incidentally” executable. The computer is not an implementation detail that can be abstracted away and ignored — it’s an integral part of the solution. A program that makes no room for the target machine in its design will inevitably run slower than one that does.</p>

<p>A common argument against taking the computer into account during the design phase of a program is “premature optimzation is the root of all evil.” Topics such as cache-friendliness, branch prediction, and parallelism are labeled as “optimization”, but really they should be labeled as “reasonable use”. Our users&#39; computers have resources and we should design our programs in a way that they use those resources.</p>
<p>Take the CPU cache for example. A simple program that shows what a massive impact good cache usage can have on performance is to sum the elements of a matrix row-by-row vs. column-by-column (here’s a <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=release&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=58f145598f757ec83498f92960336f70">Rust Playground link</a> that demonstrates this). In this example, the row-by-row is about 12–16 times faster than the column-by-column, even though they have same Big-O complexity. The difference in performance is not due to an abstract, computer science factor, but due to a very concrete one: better use of the CPU cache. The row-by-row approach brings 16 floats in cache and uses them all before going back to memory; by contrast the column-by-column approach also brings 16 floats, but only uses one of them before going back to RAM, leaving 15 values unused — that’s 94% waste.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/bmcnett/status/1043332565308923904">

</a>
<p>There are a few things we should note about this example. First, the compiler did not optimize the code for us. We often hear that programmers can’t beat an optimizing compiler, but in this case we did.  We only needed to change the order of the loops, but the Rust compiler which uses the LLVM backend, did not do it. Maybe the famed sufficiently smart compiler would, but for the foreseeable future, arranging data in a way that it can be processed efficiently will not be the compiler’s job — it’ll be ours. Second, we can’t get that speed-up without taking the actual hardware into account in our solution. We do not write code for abstract, idealized, or fictitious machines: we write code that runs on the CPUs of our users — Intel, AMD, Apple, etc. These CPUs have caches and it’s perfectly reasonable to write code that works well with the hardware rather than against it. Third, a 16x speed-up may only be a constant factor in complexity theory, but to a user it can be the difference between a program being pleasant to use and being extremely frustrating. Or the difference between a small and large AWS bill. And finally, we should not consider this to be an optimization: we’re making use of a resource that’s there. The users paid the full price of their CPU, let’s try and give them their money’s worth.</p>

<p>I expect that many will think of the old aphorism “make it work, make it right, make it fast” and argue that taking the machine into account when first writing the program is focusing on “make it fast” before we even got to “make it work”. I get that, but if we do things in order and make our program work and then make it right, when it’s time to make it fast, we often realize that our design works against us and we have to undo/redo a lot of the work we did to make the program work and to make it right.</p>
<p>For example, we may have arranged our data in a row-oriented fashion aka array of structs and we realize that in order to speed up our program we would need column-oriented storage, aka struct of arrays. Changing a program from one form to the other is a major re-architecture project, and one that may not be feasible if there’s a deadline approaching and that’s more slow software on the market and the aphorism becomes “make it work, make it right, dream of making it fast”.</p>
<p>So how do we write code that runs reasonably quickly on modern machines? We start by getting into the habit of not just thinking about the model of what we write, but also the mechanics: how many bytes are needed to represent a data structure? Are there many pointers that will cause cache misses? Is the data organized in a way that the branch prediction will be right often? Would it be easy to slice the work among multiple threads?</p>
<p>Another way is to start thinking in terms of batches and systems. Suppose we are writing a tokenizer for a programming language; if we think about tokens as completely independent pieces of data, each one needs to carry the string associated with the token (e.g., <code>struct Token { tag: Tag, text: String, ... }</code>). If instead we think of tokenization as a system and of tokens as dependents of this system, we can create a string pool in the tokenizer and tokens can have an index into the pool for their associated text. This saves memory by not having to duplicate strings and makes the tokens smaller, which means more can fit in one cache line.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dbartolini/data-oriented-design">Data-oriented
design</a> is an
approach to programming that concerns itself with such questions. At the moment, most data-oriented design practitioners work in the game industry, but the insights are valuable in every field. (For example, Andy Kelly spoke highly of data-oriented design in the <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.8.0/release-notes.html#Reworked-Memory-Layout">Zig 0.8.0 release notes</a>.) If you’ve never been exposed to data-oriented design, it can be a bit of a shock — a lot of the common <em>wisdom</em> of programming (e.g., Uncle Bob’s SOLID principles) is eschewed and replaced with cold, hard engineering. It looks scary and different, but it’s what we need to do if we are to deliver software that is not orders of magnitude slower than it can be.</p>

      <title>Show HN: Agora: Sell Files on the Web</title>
      <link>http://agora.download/files/blog/mvp.html</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  

  <p>
    tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/">Agora</a>
    is a program that lets you sell files in exchange for Lightning
    Network payments.
  </p>

  <p>
    We&#39;ve been busy these past few months building an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> of
    <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/">Agora</a>.
    The basic idea of Agora is very simple:
    It allows you to host files on a website and charge users to download them.
    It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</a> for payments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current version is still lacking a lot of functionality.
    But we&#39;re proud to announce that -- as of August 2021 --
    an initial prototypical version of Agora is running at
    <a href="http://agora.download/">agora.download</a>.
    It gives you a simple file listing, including Agora&#39;s
    <a href="http://agora.download/files/README.md">README.md</a>,
    which you can purchase on the site for the low low price of 1,000
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Units_and_divisibility">satoshis</a>.
    Payments can be made with any Lightning Network wallet.
    Some mobile Lightning Network wallets are
    <a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/">Wallet of Satoshi</a>,
    which is hosted, and <a href="https://muun.com/">Muun</a>,
    which offers self-custody.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sidenote:
    You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/">Agora GitHub repo</a>
    and download the readme from there for free,
    but where&#39;s the fun in that?
  </p>

  <p>
    Another sidenote:
    You can also go to the Agora test instance at
    <a href="http://test.agora.download/">test.agora.download</a>.
    There you can purchase our readme for testnet money.
    <a href="https://htlc.me/">htlc.me</a> is a simple Lightning Network wallet that comes pre-loaded with testnet coins.
  </p>

  <p>
    On <a href="http://agora.download/">agora.download</a>
    there&#39;s also two other folders, <code>blog</code> and <code>paid</code>.
    They both contain the blog post you&#39;re reading.
    It&#39;s free to read in <code>blog</code>, but
    -- as you might&#39;ve guessed --
    can be purchased for the low low price of 1,000 satoshis in <code>paid</code>.

  <p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</a>
    is a layer on top of Bitcoin that tries to solve the so-called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Scalability Problem</a>.
    Bitcoin payments are slow to settle and have high fees, making them
    unsuitable for small, quick payments.
    The Lightning Network is designed to overcome these problems,
    and enables microtransactions:
    Small payments with very low fees that settle instantly.
    We think that makes it a very good fit for paying for files.
    Err, I mean, lots of files on the internet are free to download, and that&#39;s great!
    And we don&#39;t want to change that.
    We don&#39;t want things that are now available for free to suddenly be locked behind
    Agora paywalls.
    That&#39;d be terrible!
    But there&#39;s lots of files on the internet that you pay for in some way,
    and that way is usually a bit weird.
    For example you pay by watching ads,
    or by giving services access to some of your private data.
    Or by paying with your credit card.
    (Credit cards are weird, right? RIGHT?)
    So we think that in some situations it&#39;d be great to be able to use
    the Lightning Network to buy and sell files on the internet.
    And that&#39;s what Agora is for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We hope that many people will use Agora to host files for a
    variety of use-cases, which is why we made Agora open-source.
    You can head over to
    <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/">github.com/agora-org/agora</a>,
    download Agora and run it on a server with files that you&#39;d like to sell.
    Installation instructions can be found in the
    <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora#readme">README.md</a>.
    (That you can also buy <a href="http://agora.download/files/README.md">here</a>,
    for the low low price of 1,000 satoshis.)
    This is a very early version,
    so any feedback -- feature requests, bug reports, usage reports and general comments --
    are very welcome, for example in the
    <a href="https://github.com/agora-org/agora/issues">github issue tracker</a>.

<h2>Why I Wrote PGP</h2>

<p><i>Part of the Original 1991 PGP User&#39;s Guide (updated in
1999)<br/>
</i></p>

<p><i>&#34;Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important
that you do it.&#34;</i></p>

<p>It&#39;s personal. It&#39;s private. And it&#39;s no one&#39;s business but
yours. You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your
taxes, or having a secret romance. Or you may be communicating with
a political dissident in a repressive country. Whatever it is, you
don&#39;t want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential
documents read by anyone else. There&#39;s nothing wrong with asserting
your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.</p>

<p>The right to privacy is spread implicitly throughout the Bill of
Rights. But when the United States Constitution was framed, the
Founding Fathers saw no need to explicitly spell out the right to a
private conversation. That would have been silly. Two hundred years
ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within
earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your
conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge.
The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just
in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the
technology of the time.</p>

<p>But with the coming of the information age, starting with the
invention of the telephone, all that has changed. Now most of our
conversations are conducted electronically. This allows our most
intimate conversations to be exposed without our knowledge.
Cellular phone calls may be monitored by anyone with a radio.
Electronic mail, sent across the Internet, is no more secure than
cellular phone calls. Email is rapidly replacing postal mail,
becoming the norm for everyone, not the novelty it was in the
past.</p>

<p>Until recently, if the government wanted to violate the privacy
of ordinary citizens, they had to expend a certain amount of
expense and labor to intercept and steam open and read paper mail.
Or they had to listen to and possibly transcribe spoken telephone
conversation, at least before automatic voice recognition
technology became available. This kind of labor-intensive
monitoring was not practical on a large scale. It was only done in
important cases when it seemed worthwhile. This is like catching
one fish at a time, with a hook and line. Today, email can be
routinely and automatically scanned for interesting keywords, on a
vast scale, without detection. This is like driftnet fishing. And
exponential growth in computer power is making the same thing
possible with voice traffic.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think your email is legitimate enough that
encryption is unwarranted. If you really are a law-abiding citizen
with nothing to hide, then why don&#39;t you always send your paper
mail on postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why
require a warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying
to hide something? If you hide your mail inside envelopes, does
that mean you must be a subversive or a drug dealer, or maybe a
paranoid nut? Do law-abiding citizens have any need to encrypt
their email?</p>

<p>What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use
postcards for their mail? If a nonconformist tried to assert his
privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion.
Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he&#39;s
hiding. Fortunately, we don&#39;t live in that kind of world, because
everyone protects most of their mail with envelopes. So no one
draws suspicion by asserting their privacy with an envelope.
There&#39;s safety in numbers. Analogously, it would be nice if
everyone routinely used encryption for all their email, innocent or
not, so that no one drew suspicion by asserting their email privacy
with encryption. Think of it as a form of solidarity.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 266, a 1991 omnibus anticrime bill, had an
unsettling measure buried in it. If this non-binding resolution had
become real law, it would have forced manufacturers of secure
communications equipment to insert special &#34;trap doors&#34; in their
products, so that the government could read anyone&#39;s encrypted
messages. It reads, &#34;It is the sense of Congress that providers of
electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic
communications service equipment shall ensure that communications
systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of
voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized
by law.&#34; It was this bill that led me to publish PGP electronically
for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after
vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.</p>

<p>The 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA) mandated that phone companies install remote wiretapping
ports into their central office digital switches, creating a new
technology infrastructure for &#34;point-and-click&#34; wiretapping, so
that federal agents no longer have to go out and attach alligator
clips to phone lines. Now they will be able to sit in their
headquarters in Washington and listen in on your phone calls. Of
course, the law still requires a court order for a wiretap. But
while technology infrastructures can persist for generations, laws
and policies can change overnight. Once a communications
infrastructure optimized for surveillance becomes entrenched, a
shift in political conditions may lead to abuse of this new-found
power. Political conditions may shift with the election of a new
government, or perhaps more abruptly from the bombing of a federal
building.</p>

<p>A year after the CALEA passed, the FBI disclosed plans to
require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the
capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in
all major U.S. cities. This would represent more than a
thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones
that could be wiretapped. In previous years, there were only about
a thousand court-ordered wiretaps in the United States per year, at
the federal, state, and local levels combined. It&#39;s hard to see how
the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough
wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls, much
less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that
traffic in real time. The only plausible way of processing that
amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated
voice recognition technology to sift through it all, searching for
interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker&#39;s voice.
If the government doesn&#39;t find the target in the first 1 percent
sample, the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1 percent
until the target is found, or until everyone&#39;s phone line has been
checked for subversive traffic. The FBI said they need this
capacity to plan for the future. This plan sparked such outrage
that it was defeated in Congress. But the mere fact that the FBI
even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda.</p>

<p>Advances in technology will not permit the maintenance of the
status quo, as far as privacy is concerned. The status quo is
unstable. If we do nothing, new technologies will give the
government new automatic surveillance capabilities that Stalin
could never have dreamed of. The only way to hold the line on
privacy in the information age is strong cryptography.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to distrust the government to want to use
cryptography. Your business can be wiretapped by business rivals,
organized crime, or foreign governments. Several foreign
governments, for example, admit to using their signals intelligence
against companies from other countries to give their own
corporations a competitive edge. Ironically, the United States
government&#39;s restrictions on cryptography in the 1990&#39;s have
weakened U.S. corporate defenses against foreign intelligence and
organized crime.</p>

<p>The government knows what a pivotal role cryptography is
destined to play in the power relationship with its people. In
April 1993, the Clinton administration unveiled a bold new
encryption policy initiative, which had been under development at
the National Security Agency (NSA) since the start of the Bush
administration. The centerpiece of this initiative was a
government-built encryption device, called the Clipper chip,
containing a new classified NSA encryption algorithm. The
government tried to encourage private industry to design it into
all their secure communication products, such as secure phones,
secure faxes, and so on. AT&amp;T put Clipper into its secure voice
products. The catch: At the time of manufacture, each Clipper chip
is loaded with its own unique key, and the government gets to keep
a copy, placed in escrow. Not to worry, though–the government
promises that they will use these keys to read your traffic only
&#34;when duly authorized by law.&#34; Of course, to make Clipper
completely effective, the next logical step would be to outlaw
other forms of cryptography.</p>

<p>The government initially claimed that using Clipper would be
voluntary, that no one would be forced to use it instead of other
types of cryptography. But the public reaction against the Clipper
chip was strong, stronger than the government anticipated. The
computer industry monolithically proclaimed its opposition to using
Clipper. FBI director Louis Freeh responded to a question in a
press conference in 1994 by saying that if Clipper failed to gain
public support, and FBI wiretaps were shut out by
non-government-controlled cryptography, his office would have no
choice but to seek legislative relief. Later, in the aftermath of
the Oklahoma City tragedy, Mr. Freeh testified before the Senate
Judiciary Committee that public availability of strong cryptography
must be curtailed by the government (although no one had suggested
that cryptography was used by the bombers).</p>

<p>The government has a track record that does not inspire
confidence that they will never abuse our civil liberties. The
FBI&#39;s COINTELPRO program targeted groups that opposed government
policies. They spied on the antiwar movement and the civil rights
movement. They wiretapped the phone of Martin Luther King. Nixon
had his enemies list. Then there was the Watergate mess. More
recently, Congress has either attempted to or succeeded in passing
laws curtailing our civil liberties on the Internet. Some elements
of the Clinton White House collected confidential FBI files on
Republican civil servants, conceivably for political exploitation.
And some overzealous prosecutors have shown a willingness to go to
the ends of the Earth in pursuit of exposing sexual indiscretions
of political enemies. At no time in the past century has public
distrust of the government been so broadly distributed across the
political spectrum, as it is today.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1990s, I figured that if we want to resist this
unsettling trend in the government to outlaw cryptography, one
measure we can apply is to use cryptography as much as we can now
while it&#39;s still legal. When use of strong cryptography becomes
popular, it&#39;s harder for the government to criminalize it.
Therefore, using PGP is good for preserving democracy. If privacy
is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.</p>

<p>It appears that the deployment of PGP must have worked, along
with years of steady public outcry and industry pressure to relax
the export controls. In the closing months of 1999, the Clinton
administration announced a radical shift in export policy for
crypto technology. They essentially threw out the whole export
control regime. Now, we are finally able to export strong
cryptography, with no upper limits on strength. It has been a long
struggle, but we have finally won, at least on the export control
front in the US. Now we must continue our efforts to deploy strong
crypto, to blunt the effects increasing surveillance efforts on the
Internet by various governments. And we still need to entrench our
right to use it domestically over the objections of the FBI.</p>

<p>PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands.
There has been a growing social need for it. That&#39;s why I wrote
it.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> of this series I noted that the languages in which I’m writing Postgres functions share a common type system. It took me a while to understand how types work in the context of Postgres functions that can return sets of records and can interact with tables and materialized views.</p>
<p>Here is a set-returning function.</p>
<pre>create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotation as $$
  begin
    return query 
      select * from annotation
      where userid = concat(&#39;acct:&#39;, _userid)
      and groupid = _groupid;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</pre>
<p>In this case the type that governs the returned set has already been defined: it’s the schema for the <tt>annotation</tt> table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Column</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>uuid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>created</td>
<td>timestamp without time zone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>updated</td>
<td>timestamp without time zone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>userid</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>groupid</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>text</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tags</td>
<td>text[]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>shared</td>
<td>boolean</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>target_uri</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>target_uri_normalized</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>target_selectors</td>
<td>jsonb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>references</td>
<td>uuid[]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>extra</td>
<td>jsonb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>text_rendered</td>
<td>text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>document_id</td>
<td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>deleted</td>
<td>boolean</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The function returns records matching a <tt>userid</tt> and <tt>groupid</tt>. I can now find the URLs of documents most recently annotated by me.</p>
<pre>select
  target_uri
from notes_for_user_in_group(&#39;judell@hypothes.is&#39;, &#39;__world__&#39;)
order by created desc
limit 3;
</pre>
<p>The Postgres response:</p>
<pre>                 target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------

 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
</pre>
<p>You might wonder why the function’s parameters are prefixed with underscores. That’s because variables used in functions can conflict with names of columns in tables. Since none of our column names begin with underscore, it’s a handy differentiator. Suppose the function’s signature were instead:</p>
<pre>create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  userid text, 
  groupid text)
</pre>
<p>Postgres would complain about a confict:</p>
<pre>ERROR:  column reference &#34;userid&#34; is ambiguous
LINE 2:       where userid = concat(&#39;acct:&#39;, userid)
                    ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
</pre>
<p>The table has <tt>userid</tt> and <tt>groupid</tt> columns that conflict with their eponymous variables. So for functions that combine variables and database values I prefix variable names with underscore.</p>
<p>Set-returning functions can be called in any SQL SELECT context. In the example above that context is <tt>psql</tt>, Postgres’ powerful and multi-talented REPL (read-eval-print loop). For an example of a different context, let’s cache the function’s result set in a materialized view.</p>
<pre>create materialized view public_notes_for_judell as (
  select
    *
  from notes_for_user_in_group(&#39;judell@hypothes.is&#39;, &#39;__world__&#39;)
  order by created desc
) with data;
</pre>
<p>Postgres reports success by showing the new view’s record count.</p>
<pre>SELECT 3972
</pre>
<p>The view’s type is implicitly <tt>annotation</tt>; its schema matches the one shown above; selecting <tt>target_uri</tt> from the view is equivalent to selecting <tt>target_uri</tt> from the <tt>setof annotation</tt> returned from the function <tt>notes_for_user_in_group</tt>.</p>
<pre>select
  target_uri
from public_notes_for_judell
limit 3;
</pre>
<p>The Postgres response is the same as above.</p>
<pre>                 target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
</pre>
<p>It shows up a lot faster though! Every time you select the function’s result set, the wrapped query has to run. For this particular example that can take a few seconds. It costs the same amount of time to create the view. But once that’s done you can select its contents in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a function that refines <tt>notes_for_user_in_group</tt> by reporting the count of notes for each annotated document.</p>
<pre>create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns table (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
) as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</pre>
<p>Instead of returning a <tt>setof</tt> some named type, this function returns an anonymous table. I’ve aliased the set-returning function call <tt>notes_for_user_in_group</tt> as <tt>n</tt> and used the alias to qualify the names of selected columns. That avoids another naming conflict. If you write <tt>userid</tt> instead of <tt>n.userid</tt> in the body of the function and then call it, Postgres again complains about a conflict.</p>
<pre>ERROR:  column reference &#34;userid&#34; is ambiguous
LINE 3:         userid,
                ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
</pre>
<p>Here’s a sample call to our new function..</p>
<pre>select 
  *
from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  &#39;judell&#39;,
  &#39;hypothes.is&#39;,
  &#39;__world__&#39;
);
</pre>
<p>The result:</p>
<pre> count | userid             | groupid   | target_uri
-------+---------------------------------------------
   516 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html
    73 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html
    51 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/coconut-oil-isnt-healthy-its-never-been-healthy/402719001/
</pre>
<p>Now let’s create a view based on that function.</p>
<pre>create materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell as (
  select 
    *
  from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
    &#39;judell@hypothes.is&#39;,
    &#39;__world__&#39;
  )
) with data;
</pre>
<p>Postgres says:</p>
<pre>SELECT 1710
</pre>
<p>When you ask for the definition of that view using the <tt>\d</tt> command in <tt>psql</tt>:</p>
<p><tt>\d url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell</tt></p>
<p>It responds with the same table definition used when creating the function.</p>
<pre> Column  |  Type  
---------+--------
 count   | bigint
 userid  | text
 groupid | text
 url     | text   
</pre>
<p>Behind the scenes Postgres has created this definition from the anonymous table returned by the function.</p>
<p>To revise the function so that it uses a named type, first create the type.</p>
<pre>create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
);
</pre>
<p>Postgres reports success:</p>
<pre>CREATE TYPE
</pre>
<p>Now we can use that named type in the function. Since we’re redefining the function, first drop it.</p>
<pre>drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group;
</pre>
<p>Uh oh. Postgres is unhappy about that.</p>
<pre>ERROR:  cannot drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text) because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell depends on function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
</pre>
<p>A view that depends on a function must be recreated when the function’s signature changes. I’ll say more about this in a future episode on set-returning functions that dynamically cache their results in materialized views. For now, since the view we just created is a contrived throwaway, just drop it along with the function by using <tt>CASCADE</tt> as Postgres recommends.</p>
<pre>drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group cascade;
</pre>
<p>Postgres says:</p>
<pre>NOTICE:  drop cascades to materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell
DROP FUNCTION
</pre>
<p>Now we can recreate a version of the function that returns <tt>setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group</tt> instead of an anonymous <tt>table(...)</tt></p>
<pre>create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</pre>
<p>The results are the same as above. So why do it this way? In many cases I don’t. It’s extra overhead to declare a type. And just as a view can depend on a function, a function can depend on a type. To see why you might not want such dependencies, suppose we want to also track the most recent note for each URL.</p>
<pre>create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text,
  most_recent_note timestamp
);
</pre>
<p>That won’t work.</p>
<pre>ERROR:  type &#34;annotated_docs_for_user_in_group&#34; already exists
</pre>
<p>Dropping the type won’t work either.</p>
<pre>ERROR:  cannot drop type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group because other objects depend on it                           
DETAIL:  function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text,text) depends on type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group    
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
</pre>
<p>To redefine the type you have to do a cascading drop and then recreate functions that depend on the type. If any of those views depend on dropped functions, the drop cascades to them as well and they also must be recreated. That’s why I often write functions that return <tt>table(...)</tt> rather than <tt>setof TYPE</tt>. In dynamic languages it’s convenient to work with untyped bags of values; I find the same to be true when writing functions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to declare and use types. In my experience so far it makes most sense to do that in Postgres when you find yourself writing the same <tt>returns table(...)</tt> statement in several related functions. Let’s say we want a function that combines the results of <tt>annotated_docs_for_user_in_group</tt> for some set of users.</p>
<pre>create function annotated_docs_for_users_in_group(_userids text[], _groupid text)
  returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
    begin
      return query 
        with userids as (
          select unnest(_userids) as userid
        )
        select 
          a.*
        from userids u
        join annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(u.userid, _groupid) a
          on a.userid = concat(&#39;acct:&#39;, u.userid);
    end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</pre>
<p>This new function uses the SQL WITH clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that converts an inbound array of userids into a transient table-like object, named <tt>userids</tt>, with one userid per row. The new function’s wrapped SQL then joins that CTE to the set returned from <tt>annotated_docs_for_user_in_group</tt> and returns the joined result.</p>
<p>(You can alternatively do this in a more procedural way by creating a loop variable and marching through the array to accumulate results. Early on I used that approach but in the context of Postgres functions I’ve come to prefer the more purely SQL-like set-oriented style.)</p>
<p>Sharing a common type between the two functions makes them simpler to write and easier to read. More importantly it connects them to one another and to all views derived from them. If I do decide to add <tt>most_recent_note</tt> to the type, Postgres will require me to adjust all depending functions and views so things remain consistent. That can be a crucial guarantee, and as we’ll see in a future episode it’s a key enabler of an advanced caching mechanism.</p>

But encryption may not necessarily guarantee privacy, especially when it comes to metadata.</p><p>Emerging standards such as DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or Encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI) can protect the content of both DNS queries and the TLS SNI extensions. However, it might still be possible to determine which websites users are visiting by simply looking at the destination IP addresses on the traffic originating from users’ devices, which are visible as a part of the ClientHello of the TLS Handshake.</p><p>This metadata can be exploited and monetized by several agents to profile and target the user for advertising.</p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a id="thumbnail-link-co-hover-30257" href="https://blog.apnic.net/2019/07/29/opinion-some-not-so-private-thoughts-from-ietf-105/" target="_blank" rel="bookmark noopener"><strong>Some not so private thoughts from IETF 105</strong> </a></p><h4>Searching for Page Load Fingerprints</h4><p>We, at the University of Illinois, did a measurement study to understand whether an adversary can deduce the websites a user is trying to connect to, using a set of IP addresses originating from the user’s device alone.</p><p>Using a highly configurable web crawler built on top of Chromium called MIDA, we performed DNS resolution on all domains involved in rendering the most popular websites listed in the Alexa Top 1 Million.</p><p><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IPlearn_img1.png"></a></p><p><span>Figure 1 — The workflow we adopted to perform our measurement study.</span></p><p>We also accounted for several resources that get loaded from different web servers due to the sub-queries performed when a website is requested.

      <title>The Mighty Fallen: Argentina and the Great Depression</title>
      <link>https://www.historytoday.com/archive/behind-times/mighty-fallen</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <section>
          
            <div><p>The victory of the former academic and lawyer, Alberto Fernández, in Argentina’s 2019 general election was met with enthusiasm by many at home and abroad. The neo-liberal toolkit employed by the previous administration of Mauricio Macri had clearly failed, resulting in hyperinflation, rising unemployment and the lowest standard of living for a decade; some surveys suggest 40 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line. Eighteen months down the line, the pandemic has thrown the government’s unrealistic plans to make a deal with creditors of the country’s vast private debt into disarray. Argentina became the first Latin American country to distribute the Russian Sputnik vaccine and the president encouraged others by being among the first to take it. Two months later, he tested positive for coronavirus. The health system has not collapsed as it has in Brazil, but social media is rife with claims that Latin America’s second biggest economy is destined to end up like that of Venezuela. </p>

<h3><b>Failed state</b></h3>
<p>Something has gone awry in what was the most successful of all the 19th-century liberal republics in Spanish America. In the early 20th century, Argentina’s per capita GDP ranked among the world’s top ten, on a par with Australia and Canada and ahead of France and Italy. In a nation state comprised largely of immigrants, Argentinians have consistently prided themselves on living in the most ‘European’ of Latin American countries, despite all the sociopolitical upheavals they have endured since the Great Depression. A military government was formed in 1943 in the wake of a coup, in which General Juan Perón was a major player. Alongside his wife, Evita – an actress and singer born into poverty – the championing of workers’ rights leveraged popular support and Perón won the democratic general election of 1946. </p>
<p>Argentina did not pledge allegiance to the US in the Second World War and was officially neutral. Perón privately favoured an Axis victory, an open secret that ensured the country was left out of aid programmes in the 1940s. Evita died in 1952. </p>
<p>After Perón fell out with his fellow military officers, a 1955 coup forced him into exile in Franco’s Spain, amid the first Brits to take package holidays in Torremolinos and later as Ava Gardner’s neighbour in Madrid. In the wake of the coup, Evita’s embalmed body was removed from the Buenos Aires headquarters of the CGT – the largest Peronist trade union – in the middle of the night as part of an operation to erase the regime and its most potent symbol from the collective consciousness. Taken on peripatetic exile, by the time her corpse arrived home two decades later, one of Evita’s fingers had gone missing. On returning to Argentina, in 1973 Perón received an electoral mandate to rule but died the following year. His third wife, Isabel – who met her future husband when he was in exile in Panama, where she was working as a nightclub dancer – was promoted from vice-president to the presidency. While Evita was, to quote the academic Edwin Williamson, ‘a populist of rare genius’, Isabel was not up to the job. The coup of 1976 was hardly an anomaly in a country with a long tradition of military intervention in political life. Many Argentinians welcomed the uprising, assuming it would help to reinstate some sense of peace and stability. </p>

<h3><b>Victory and defeat</b></h3>
<p>The torture and disappearance of thousands of political opponents did not stop Argentina from hosting the 1978 World Cup – which it won. Margaret Thatcher inadvertently precipitated the end of the dictatorship following the Falklands War of 1982, when the military junta showed no compunction in sending young men to their deaths, in battle and from starvation.    </p>
<p>Commitment to human rights and accountability were instrumental in Raúl Alfonsín’s victory in the 1983 election over the Peronists, who, it was rumoured, were negotiating an amnesty deal with the military. Long referred to almost condescendingly as a ‘good man’, an ‘Argentinian Jimmy Carter’, Alfonsín’s standing has improved since his death in 2009. Although not given a general release, the documentary film <i>Raúl, la democracia desde dentro</i> (‘Raúl, Democracy from the Inside’) enjoyed sold-out screenings for weeks in Buenos Aires. At one screening a collective gasp was evident as the film unearthed a photograph showing a teenage Raúl as a classmate of General Galtieri – the third president of the military junta, who was as renowned for his alcoholism as for his human rights abuses – and many laughed out loud at archive footage of Alfonsín sharpening his oratory claws in the White House gardens. Ronald Reagan played dirty by changing his speech at the last minute in an unsuccessful attempt to bully the Argentinian premier into endorsing US intervention in Nicaragua. </p>
<p>Alfonsín’s administration constituted the international gold standard for the speed and efficiency with which human rights abuses were put on trial, but he struggled to rationalise a still volatile export economy decimated by the inefficacy and nepotism of the military junta. Argentina is rich in natural resources, but the legacy of Perón’s protectionism made it industrially uncompetitive. Rampant inflation forced Alfonsín to call early elections in 1989. Waiting in the wings was Carlos Menem, whose neo-liberal government unleashed an unprecedented period of economic reform during its decade in power, privatising much of the state’s resources. While traditional ideologies of left and right cannot be easily mapped onto Argentina’s complex political landscape, Francis Fukuyama’s claims about the end of history following the fall of the Berlin Wall were influential in the Latin American state’s nascent democracy. Under Menem, citizens were encouraged to forget the past and look to the future. The peso was artificially overvalued, giving Argentinians greater spending power abroad as an aspiring middle class took foreign holidays like never before.</p>

<h3><b>Disproportionate power </b></h3>
<p>Argentinian presidents continue to have a disproportionate amount of power, with the systems of checks and balances characteristic of mature democracies noticeably absent. The economic and moral bankruptcy of Menem’s administration resulted in a financial crash in 2001. Scenes of panicked customers unable to get their money out of the banks prompted a mass exodus of foreign and domestic capital. Néstor Kirchner was voted in on a populist ticket in 2003 as part of the so-called ‘pink tide’, which saw charismatic ‘strongmen’ such as Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva gain power. When George W. Bush visited Mar de Plata in 2005 for the Fourth Summit of the Americas, the US president’s attempts to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas were scuppered by Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. Football legend Diego Maradona joined Chávez and the future President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, to lead a crowd of over 25,000 to the resort’s stadium in order to protest against the presence of Bush Jr.   </p>

<h3><b>Short-changed </b></h3>
<p>The Argentinian philosopher Ernesto Laclau has called for the need to rescue populism ‘from its marginal position within the discourse of the social sciences’, which sees it as ‘the simple opposite of political forms dignified with the status of full rationality’. As Laclau’s long-term collaborator Chantal Mouffe remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Instead of trying to erase the traces of power and exclusion, democratic politics requires us to bring them to the fore, to make them visible so that they can enter the terrain of contestation.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citizens of Argentina have been short-changed by neo-liberal democracy and populism alike. While lining his own pockets, Kirchner retained favour through such measures as introducing pension rights for workers in the widespread black economy. Néstor stepped aside in 2007 and his wife, Cristina Kirchner, was elected president. She was in power until 2015 and has since returned to government as Fernández’s vice-president. </p>
<p>Despite the goodwill shown to the incoming government by many Argentinian citizens, there are no quick-fix solutions for a nation state whose currency is sufficiently volatile for house prices and rents to be given in US dollars. Alfonsín was pilloried for allowing inflation to get out of control, but in truth no president has managed to keep it in check. Before the pandemic hit, the weak peso made the country attractive to tourists: the bars of the renamed Palermo Hollywood and Palermo Soho districts of Buenos Aires were as full of North American visitors as the hip hangouts of Mexico City’s La Condesa or Roma neighbourhoods. A couple of dollars was enough to taxi tourists across the city, few choosing to use the efficient and safe, albeit stuffy, underground system, parachuting in and out of such Instagram-friendly sites as the Museum of Modern Art and Plaza Dorrego in the historic San Telmo district. It was possible to pay two dollars to see <i>Happyland</i> – a historical musical about María Estela Martínez de Perón (popularly known as Isabel) being imprisoned alongside her Andalusian maid after the military uprising – at the National Theatre. The city’s finest <i>fainá</i> (an Argentinian variation on pizza, with a chickpea base) and a beer in Guërrin, the most celebrated of the Italian hangouts on the Broadway of Latin America, cost five dollars. </p>

<h3><b>Boom and bust</b></h3>
<p>The body politic can hardly be in good shape when those who can afford to go out benefit from bargains, but milk and fruit bought in supermarkets cost more than in the UK. Speculators amass basic necessities and grocery stores were as empty if not emptier in December 2019 than any supermarkets in the UK at the height of the pandemic. As has happened with so many other places around the world, coronavirus has served to highlight and reinforce pre-existing fractures. The pendulum swings in political regimes in Argentina are in many respects symptomatic of the inability to place control over an export economy overly exposed to fluctuations in the global market. Trapped in a cycle of boom and bust, the latest crisis seems poised to leave much of the middle-as well as the working-classes in abject poverty.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="history">
<p>How did it come about?</p>
<p>It started in 2011 as a simple tool to help researchers unlock paywalled research papers. It could break the wall between a human being and a scientific knowledge.</p>
</div><p>
<span>Sci-Hub is a freely accessible decentralized database of more than 85,000,000 research papers, used by more than 500,000 people every day. These people are scientists and students, medical practitioners and journalists.</span>
</p><p><span>Sci-Hub is run fully on donations. Instead of charging for access to information, it creates a common pool of knowledge free for anyone to access.</span>
</p><div id="howtodonate">
    
    <div>
<p>Sci-Hub accepts donations in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a> is a modern digital and decentralized version of money that is not controlled by any government or other entity. Currently there are more than 10,000 various cryptocurrencies available. Sci-Hub accepts the most popular of them.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bitcoin">
        <p></p>
        <p>
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that was invented in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Currently it is the most popular one. To donate by Bitcoin use the QR code, or send your bitcoins directly to this address:

    </div>
</div><div id="interview">
    
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> Why did you create Sci-Hub?</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>When I was a student I wanted to do a research project on brain-computer interfaces... and all scientific journals were paywalled. I thought there must be some program, or a website that will provide these journals for free. We can download music, movies and books on the Internet for free. Why cant we do the same for academic papers?</span></p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> Where did you get the initial funding for the project? How big it was?</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>There was zero initial funding! I started Sci-Hub absoutely for free. I uploaded the first version of Sci-Hub code on some free web hosting and it started to work right away. There were very little users at the beginning so Sci-Hub did not require expensive servers to run on.
<p>People then asked if they can help Sci-Hub by sending donations, so I added this option.</p></span></p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> How much was that? Was it enough to cover Sci-Hub expenses?</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>
I did not count, but that was more than enough. Then I wanted to buy a Synology server for Sci-Hub, to store a database that contained 21 million research papers back then. The cost of the server was several thousand dollars.
<p>
I posted a message on Sci-Hub website urging people to send donations to buy new servers. I also mentioned that Elsevier CEO <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/12/reed-elsevier-chief-engstrom-pay">is paid millions of dollars</a> (Elsevier is an academic publisher that works by selling access to scientific journals for extremely high prices) If you compare Elsevier CEO salary to the minuscule wages of an ordinary researcher, especially in Russia, you will go insane!
</p><p>
The sum needed to buy the server was collected in a few days or in a week. Many donations had notes attached to them, saying <b>Thank you for access to research!</b> or some other good words.
</p><p>
Back then, I also maintained a public list of all donations Sci-Hub received, because I was a big fan of transparency. But with growing number of donations it became harder to do so I stopped doing this. However, you can look at the archived version of the old donations page <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120705034216/https://sci-hub.org/donate">here</a>.
        </p></span></p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> Did you try using methods other than donations? Such as advertisements, premium accounts...</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>
In the very beginning there were some ads on Sci-Hub. Some people clicked them deliberately to help the project. But these ads were bringing minuscule amount of money and made Sci-Hub look ugly, so I removed them.
<p>
When Sci-Hub became popular in India and China in 2013 the number of users grew very high, and Sci-Hub started to get issues. I introduced certain limits on paper downloads then. That was the time when some Sci-Hub users asked to add paid premium accounts with unlimited downloads. I thought about the idea, but then rejected it, because it would be an introduction of a paid access, and that would go against the mission of Sci-Hub.
</p><p>
Now Sci-Hub is running without any limits and free for everyone. Regarding paid access, I contemplated on the idea. Academic publishers sell access to each paper for about 30 dollars each. Sci-Hub provides the same articles for free. If I charged just one dollar $1 per access to each article, I would make 2 million US dollars every day! Compared to this sum, donations bring minuscule amount of money
        </p></span></p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> Previously you said that most donations came from Russia, do international users donate?</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>
Yes, in the past I used also PayPal account to collect donations from abroad. It worked well for a while, but when I posted a message on Sci-Hub urging people to donate, if my memory is correct it was in 2013, donations started to come at a cosmic speed... in a couple of days two or three thousands of dollars were collected. But then the account was frozen by PayPal. It turned out that Elsevier has complained to PayPal about Sci-Hub so they <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations">froze the account</a>.
<p>
Later I tried registering another PayPal account, and use it carefully, but after some time it also got frozen. I have several frozen PayPal accounts by now.
        </p></span></p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="qa">
        <p><span>Q</span><span> So that was the time when you started to collect donations by Bitcoin?</span></p>
        <p><span>A:</span><span>
Not exactly... I was asked to add Bitcoin by one of the Sci-Hub users many years ago, back then Bitcoin cost was less than one thousand dollars. But everyone knew that Bitcoin is some kind of a cool anonymous currency that can be used by hackers and illegal projects and so on.
<p>
And Sci-Hub has that illegal status of a shadow pirate website.
</p><p>
The most important feature of cryptocurrencies is that unlike PayPal, or bank accounts they cannot be frozen by a third party because your project is illegal or because Elsevier complained about it. They are safe currency. Thats why today Sci-Hub collects donations primarily in crypto.
</p><p>
When Sci-Hub becomes legal, which should happen because that is ridiculous, when academic library is considered to be outlaw – then it will be able to use other methods too. But perhaps by that time cryptocurrency will become default money and all other alternatives will disappear. Who knows?

I also don’t like being forced to donate free labor to AI companies to help train their visual-recognition systems.</p><p id="0087">But a while ago, while numbly clicking on grainy images of fire hydrants, I was struck by another reason:</p><p id="d429">The images are deeply, overwhelmingly <em>depressing.</em></p><p id="d422">CAPTCHA images are neve<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">r</span></span> joyful vistas of human activity, full of Whitmanesque vigor. No, they’re blurry, anonymous landscapes that possess a positively Soviet anomie. Here’s a typical one …</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="38de">You can feel your spirits deflate just beholding this picture, can’t you? Even worse, really, are the jumble of bleak images …</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c97a">Each cube here is a tone poem in melancholia. Looking at these leaden vistas of America makes you, slightly but noticeably, feel worse than you did before.</p><p id="e741">Why are these photos so depressing? What is it about their composition that is so enervating? I’ve been musing on this for a few months now, and had <a href="https://twitter.com/Emdashes/status/1339769599848570886" rel="noopener nofollow">some</a> terrific <a href="https://twitter.com/pomeranian99/status/1339749551725547520" rel="noopener nofollow">exchanges</a> about <a href="https://twitter.com/Emdashes/status/1339752195433123842" rel="noopener nofollow">it</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/toddpruzan" rel="noopener nofollow">Todd Pruzan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Emdashes" rel="noopener nofollow">Emily Gordon</a>, two friends of mine, on Twitter.</p><p id="1546">I think I’ve figured it out, and so now I present — <strong>The Six Reasons CAPTCHA Pictures Make You Feel Like Crap:</strong></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><h2 id="3337">1) They’re devoid of humans</h2><p id="4651">CAPTCHA images are pictures of the outside world, but it’s a world that is unsettlingly bare of people. This is likely for privacy reasons, which is a laudable motive on Google’s part. But it winds up making the pictures look totally postapocalyptic. Each CAPTCHA depicts a world blasted by a neutron bomb, where the objects survive but none of the people do.</p><figure><p></p></figure><p id="594d">When the photos actually <em>do </em>include humans, it’s somehow even creepier, because they are (again, for privacy reasons) shot from afar, and unidentifiable. So the only people you see are these weird replicants devoid of individuality. The guy in the red shirt in this next photo, bottom center: Where is he going? Why are we watching him go there?</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4683">2) The angles are all wrong</h2><p id="2b2c">CAPTCHA pictures are often shot from extremely <em>awkward</em> angles — angles that we humans would never pick.</p><p id="9ec1">When you or I take a picture, we typically shoot from the view from our eyes. We’re usually holding the camera; our body is inherently involved in framing the view. But CAPTCHA photos were taken to train self-driving cars, so they were shot from the vantage-point of cameras mounted on Google’s Waymo experimental vehicles. That’s why the angles are just so oddly <em>off.</em></p><p id="6016">As Emily put it …</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="161b">It’s a subtle thing, but once Emily points this out, you can’t unsee it! Look at the angles on these picture here …</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="d886">The top three images looks sort of normal. But the bottom six are just a bit strange. The center picture is not the view from which you or I would typically behold a car. Each crosswalk image is taken from a position that’s <em>close</em> to that a human-eye view, but off by like 10 degrees or something.</p><p id="8837">It’s like they fall into some sort of uncanny valley of camera-perspective.</p><h2 id="4ebf">3) They’re voyeuristic</h2><p id="43fd">These pictures all give off the icky vibe that comes from a lack of consent. Nobody in the photos expected to be photographed. These images are thus all inherently voyeuristic. Worse, because they’re also incredibly bland, the voyeurism feels all the more sordid and vapid. As Todd put it …</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="79f4">4) They look like crime-scene footage</h2><p id="2962">Google’s CAPTCHA images are frequently grainy and badly focused. This is likely because, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow">as Vox points out</a>, Google has gone through most of the easy visual-recognition training cases, where the pictures were clear and sharp. Now they’re stuck with the hard stuff, which tend to be pictures of terrible quality.</p><p id="b6ea">This gives CAPTCHA images the low-res feel of a crime-scene video, as Todd noted in a tweet: “They remind me a lot of CCTV or dashcam video footage.” When you look at the pictures, it feels like you’re about to see some terrible incident.</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4b9f">These pictures! My god. They’re simply <em>ashudder</em> with suspense and dread. That taxi in the middle frame: What dread cargo does it carry, to what wretched appointment? The bottom right photo looks like something you’d see plastered on a WANTED poster. And good grief, in the bottom left: What looming terror is casting that fuzzy, Lovecraftian shadow?</p><h2 id="a661">5) The grids on the photos are an alien’s-eye view of the world</h2><p id="d31f">When you get those CAPTCHAs that chop up a single photo into sixteen squares, the imposition of those crisp white lines feels so disconcerting. It’s an alien view of the world:<em> Behold the riddle of human existence. What could it possibly mean? </em>By asking us to identify elements of an image that are sliced into pieces — “Select all squares with traffic lights” — CAPTCHAs turn everyday reality into a puzzle that no normal human would ever think of as a puzzle.</p><p id="2df7">This is what’s so disquieting about the exercise. We’re being asked to parse the world in the visual-scanning style of an AI. Which, in turn, makes <em>you</em> feel like an AI, hunting for meaning in a baffling world.</p><figure><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="3dc6">6) There’s very little nature</h2><p id="310d">Self-driving AI is worried about recognizing things in the built environment — stoplights, taxis, cyclists, fire hydrants, crosswalks. It doesn’t care about trees, or the fractal beauty of leaves, or flowers or birds or creeks or really <em>any </em>of the objects to which the human eye gravitates with delight.</p><p id="8eef">This is why CAPTCHA photos are a nonstop brutalist slideshow of metal and concrete. It is as if someone took you on a tour of a lovely scenic town, but strapped you into horse blinders and forced you to stare only at fire hydrants.</p><p id="256f">(The one exception is, improbably, palm trees. I keep on getting CAPTCHAs asking me to recognize palm trees. I have no idea what’s going on there! Did, like, a Waymo car once slam into a palm tree?)</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="bf58">Here’s the thing, ultimately, about Google’s CAPTCHA images:</p><p id="e5c1">They weren’t taken <em>by</em> humans, and they weren’t taken <em>for </em>humans. They are by AI, for AI. They thus lack any sense of human composition or human audience. They are creations of utterly bloodless industrial logic. Google’s CAPTCHA images demand you to look at the world the way an AI does.</p><p id="6ef3">It’s no wonder we wind up feeling so numbed and depressed as we click through them, day in and day out.</p><p id="b906">Sometimes I try to put a playful spin on this, and imagine Google’s CAPTCHA system as a massive, surreal Art Prank the corporation is playing on the public. I mean, you <em>could</em> squint at this and see it as art, right? That’s what good art does: It shakes us out of normal perceptions and forces us to look at life in a new, slightly alien fashion. And hey, plenty of art uses automation and randomness to produce combinations that sidestep normal human meaning-making.</p><p id="7145">The problem with CAPTCHAS, though, is that we’re <em>forced</em> to look at these images, by a $1.8 trillion firm. It makes it a lot harder to find any sort of aesthetic intrigue here.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7538">What has it done to humanity, to be forced us to regard these images, for years on end? Cloudfare recently calculated that we humans collectively spend 500 years, <em>every single day</em>, looking at CAPTCHAs. I’ve often joked on Twitter about the strange philosophical ratholes that CAPTCHAs lead me into. (“Wait, wait, is the pole that supports a stop sign part of the sign?”) And it’s now common to chuckle over the deep irony that we’re all forced by robots to prove that we’re human.</p><p id="a64e">But these pictures? These pictures erode the soul.</p></div></div></section><section></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Mysterious Street Snack That Has Baffled Botanists for Decades</title>
      <link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/indian-street-snack-root</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_atlasobscura_com_articles_indian-street-snack-root/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body">
<p><span>A vendor was cutting slices </span>off what looked like the trunk of a tree on his push-cart. This was in Bengaluru, the city in the south Indian state of Karnataka where I live. The core was a creamy white and the skin a brownish-orange. He cut horizontally, in circles, with the precision of a surgeon, so thin that I could see through the pieces.</p>
<p>“It’s a root. It can grow five feet deep and 300kg,” he explained, in response to my shock. He sources it, he said, from the neighbouring state of Kerala, from people who “get it from the forests.” He hasn’t seen anybody extract the root, but has seen the tree it comes from. “It’s like a climber. It gives flowers. It grows near the sea. It’s called <em>Bhoochakara Gadda</em> in south India and <em>Ram Kand Mool</em> up north.”</p>
<p>Can a root be this massive? Especially the root of a climber or vine? Before I could ask Google, my snack was ready. It was seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime; my husband’s had sugar and lime. It was crunchy, juicy, and refreshing, but had no taste of its own.</p>
<p>That night, I googled <em>Bhoochakara Gadda</em>. There wasn’t much. Wikipedia identified the scientific name of the plant as <em>Maerua oblongifolia</em>, but had no photos of it. <em>Maerua oblongifolia</em> is a low, woody, undershrub found in India, Pakistan, parts of Africa, and Saudi Arabia, whose tubers are sold as snacks and used as a stimulant in the ancient medicine system of Siddha, I read. Research papers showed its leaves and flowers but not the root. So I decided to dig in.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Most online sources cite <em>Maerua oblongifolia</em>, pictured here, as the source of the snack, likely inaccurately. <span>Courtesy Dr. MS Rathore </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I contacted a wood scientist, a professor of food science, and a Siddha practitioner, each from my state. They hadn’t seen the tree. I pivoted my search to another state in the south, Andhra Pradesh. I called up its tribal department, but got no leads. Then my messages to the head of the biodiversity board were met with silence. I spoke to a botany researcher who had studied the tree, only to learn he had never seen it in person.</p>
<p>Soon enough, I’d learn that my idle curiosity was, in fact, a mystery that has baffled and, at times, infuriated botanists for decades. This snack has been widely sold on the streets for decades—from the city of Haridwar in the north to Pune in the west and in several places in the south—and yet, somehow, no one seems to know what it is.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span>I had a breakthrough a </span>few months later when I came across a thesis paper by Dr. MS Rathore, who had propagated <em>Maerua oblongifolia </em>in the lab in 2011. He had seen the tree many times in the desert state of Rajasthan. “But I haven’t heard or seen anybody eating the root,” the scientist said over a call, sounding puzzled.</p>
<p>“Its roots are sparse and inedible,” added Dr. NS Shekhawat, his thesis adviser and a retired professor of botany. “Growing in dry regions, where will it have so much water to develop big roots and be fat and juicy? [The snack] can’t be <em>Maerua oblongifolia</em>.”</p>
<p>The duo sent me photos of the tree, which did not match the description on Wikipedia. And the roots in the photos were grown in a lab and too tiny to conclude anything.</p>
<p>I spoke next to Dr. T Pullaiah, former president of The Indian Botanical Society. In his 2019 <em>Encyclopaedia of World Medicinal Plants, </em>he links this snack to <a href="https://www.bimbima.com/ayurveda/medicinal-herb-vidarialligator-yam-ipomoea-digitata/363/"><em>Ipomoea </em></a><em>d</em><a href="https://www.bimbima.com/ayurveda/medicinal-herb-vidarialligator-yam-ipomoea-digitata/363/"><em>igitata</em></a><em>, </em>a climber that grows a large tuberous root with a yellowish-brown coat. He must have seen the root, I thought. “No. It was second-hand knowledge. We are professors, busy between teaching and administrative work, so we rely on existing literature to come to conclusions,” he explained.</p>
<p>So I made more calls, wrote more emails. And a new name came up that nullified all my research.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span>The year was 1994. </span>Ethnobotanist Dr. Koppula Hemadri was going around India “digging out roots” to confirm the origins of this snack. He ended his search with agave. These are succulents that look like aloe vera but can grow up to 10 feet wide and twice as tall. Some have a stout stem topped with spiny leaves, like pineapples. Some appear stemless.</p>
<p>“I tasted the base of agave<em>, </em>that’s attached to roots,” remarked Dr. Hemadri, who’s now retired and lives in Andhra Pradesh. “It was starchy and a bit like that snack. But I did not pursue [the lead] after that.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>Agave grows abundantly a few hours from Bengaluru, a city where the snack is a commonly sold. <span>Courtesy Barkha Kumari</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the same year, in the same state, botanist Dr. Ali Moulali got closer: “I told a vendor I would pay him Rs1,000-2,000 ($13-27) more if he revealed the identity of the plant. He hesitated and said, ‘It’s the base of <em>Kitta Nara.’</em> “ That’s what the fibre made from agave is locally called. The vendor also revealed that it wasn’t a root, but something that grew just above the ground.</p>
<p>In the same period, flowering-plant taxonomist Dr. SR Yadav was encouraging his students in the western state of Maharashtra to scrutinise <em>Ram Kand</em>, which is the snack’s local name there. Two of his students—Dr. Mansingraj S Nimbalkar and Dr. Vinod B Shimpale, who were studying molecular biology and taxonomy—went on to provide the most scientific insight into this mystery.</p>
<p>In 2010, after a long anatomical study, they performed DNA barcoding on a slice of the snack and found it to match that of agave’s by 89 percent. There are several species of agave, but the lab test narrowed it down to <em>Agave Sisalana,</em> a plant sometimes used to make a tequila-like drink<em>. </em>They did a field visit soon after and plucked out a <em>Sisalana </em>only to find mesh-like, shallow roots. Next, they chopped off its leaves and there it was: the fat, white, watery trunk familiar to millions of Indians from food carts. They ate a slice from it, and it was tasteless and crunchy just like <em>Ram Kand</em>. The findings were <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248398506_DNA_barcoding_for_identification_of_the_enigmatic_plant_Ramkand">published in<em>Current Science </em>the following year</a>.</p>
<figure><figcaption>It’s sold only in ultra-thin slices. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoEwSennmyB/">Courtesy Mahesh M</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>So why is there still doubt about the identity of this snack? “Which species of agave is it—<em>Sisalana </em>or <em>Americana </em>or any other?” Dr. Shimpale says. “We can’t conclude until the vendors show the plant to us. They keep this as a business secret to create curiosity around it.”</p>
<p>Yes, there is a pattern to what the vendors say: It’s a root; it’s medicinal; they get it from a forest 200 kilometers away or in Africa. They say the Hindu god Ram, and his wife and brother, subsisted on <em>Ram Kand </em>during their exile in the forests, and that <em>Bhoochakara Gadda </em>is a sweet-something growing underground. Try to buy their stock in bulk and they’ll spare no more than a few slices. Probe them and they’ll cart away. “Forest officials in Maharashtra have tried to spy on them, but it was futile,” Dr. Nimbalkar recalls.</p>
<p>Going on a hunch, I rang up a senior forest official in Karnataka, GS Yadav. “You need permission to remove or extract anything from any forest,” he says clearly. But agave doesn’t fully fit into the forest bracket. It grows widely in India, on roadsides, along railway tracks, as fencing. However, it may not be so healthy. “Agave has lots of alkaloids. It can be poisonous if eaten in large quantities. Maybe that’s why they sell thin slices,” Dr. Yadav, now retired, warns.</p>
<p>I felt increasingly certain that agave was the answer until Dr. Chenna Kesava Reddy Sangati, an assistant professor of nutrition &amp; technology in Bengaluru, dubbed it “impossible.” He has researched agave extensively in order to produce an alcoholic beverage from its <em>Albomarginata </em>variety. “I have eaten <em>Bhoochakara Gadda</em>. It has a smoother mouthfeel, is softer to bite, and is not very sweet,” he says. “Whereas this agave is highly sweet, astringent, fibrous, and hard to bite.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>Dr. Chenna Kesava Reddy Sangati shows the insides of the trunk of <em>Agave Albomerginata</em>. He says this snack can’t be related to agave. <span>Courtesy Dr. Chenna Kesava Reddy Sangati</span></figcaption></figure>
<hr/>
<p><span>In April, the second wave </span>of coronavirus in India had set in. Crowds on the street had thinned, push-carts were fewer, and the vendor I had first met was gone. “He has gone to his village,” a man who sells watermelons on the same street told me. But he passed on the vendor’s contact number.</p>
<p>Fearing another lockdown, the vendor had returned to the northern state of Jharkhand. The pandemic was killing his business and he wanted to know from me when things will be normal. What could I say?</p>
<p>We shifted the topic and he came clean easily: “It’s a stem … I sell it year-round … I have seen the plant only in photos, on the phone.” Oh! “Will you give me the phone number of the person you source <em>Bhoochakara Gadda</em> from?” I asked. He went silent.</p>
<p>“Ask anything but this, please. Nobody will tell you anything. This is how this business is,” he told me, getting irritated by the minute. Then he calmed down. “I’ve been eating this for years. It cools the body. Customers say it’s good for diabetes. It’s not illegal, I know.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>The vendors smear red coloring on the sides to preserve the white interior. <span>Courtesy Barkha Kumari</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After questioning my motives for calling him, he agreed to look at photos of the plants that experts were debating. “None,” he replied. I was gutted but called back to thank him. But then he said, “Photo number 3. That’s the plant.” It was <em>Agave Sisalana</em>. He okayed Photo number 2 as well, which was <em>Agave Americana</em>. There was no word on Photo No. 1, <em>Maerua oblongifolia. </em></p>
<p>“They cut the leaves and rub red color on the trunk to preserve its white color,” he explained.</p>
<p>So is this an agave snack, after all? I will wait for the final word, as Dr. MS Shekhawat, another botanist from Rajasthan, has assured me that after the pandemic is over, he will go into the field, uproot, slice, and taste a sample of each likely candidate, and resolve the mystery once and for all.</p>

      <title>When Encryption Was a Crime: The 1990s Battle for Free Speech in Software</title>
      <link>https://reason.com/video/2020/10/21/cryptowars-gilmore-zimmermann-cryptography/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___reason_com_video_2020_10_21_cryptowars-gilmore-zimmermann-cryptography_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>This is the third installment in Reason&#39;s four-part documentary series titled &#34;Cypherpunks Write Code.&#34; Watch the complete series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBuns9Evn1w-T2RwqMhUnTZbTTe-M-g42">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>In 1977, a team of cryptographers at MIT made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">an astonishing discovery</a>: a mathematical system for encrypting secret messages so powerful that it had the potential to make government spying effectively impossible.</p>
<p>Before the MIT team could publish a description of how this system worked, the National Security Agency (NSA) made it known that doing so could be considered a federal crime. The 1976 Arms Export Control Act (AECA) made it illegal to distribute munitions in other countries without a license, <a href="https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2264&amp;context=gsulr">including cryptography.</a> The penalty for violating AECA was up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to one million dollars.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">crypto wars</a>&#34;—the legal and public relations battle between the intelligence community and privacy activists over the rights of citizens to use end-to-end encryption. Many of those who were involved in the crypto wars were associated with the &#34;cypherpunk movement,&#34; a community of hackers, hobbyists, and computer scientists, which the mathematician Eric Hughes once described as &#34;cryptography activists.&#34;</p>
<p>The crypto wars continue to this day: On October 11, 2020, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety">joint statement</a> with officials from six other countries that implored tech companies not to use strong end-to-end encryption in their products so that law enforcement agencies can access the communications of their customers.</p>
<p>The government&#39;s stance traces back to World War II, when Allied code-breakers helped secure victory by deciphering secret messages sent by the Axis powers. &#34;And that is the origin of the regulations that said, &#39;This is munition, this is an item of war,&#39;&#34; civil liberties activist John Gilmore told <em>Reason</em>. &#34;And the problem was that they didn&#39;t really take freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry, academic freedom, into account in that.&#34;</p>
<p>In 1977, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which was planning to hold a conference on cryptography at Cornell University, received <a href="http://cryptome.org/hellman/1977-0707-Meyer-letter.pdf">a letter</a> from an NSA employee posing as a concerned citizen, who wrote that the U.S. government considered these mathematical systems &#34;modern weapons technologies&#34; and that distributing them was a federal crime. The letter caused widespread alarm in the cryptography community.</p>
<p>In 1977, the computer scientist Mark S. Miller was a 20-year-old student at Yale. Like many future cypherpunks, he read about the breakthrough at MIT in <a href="https://simson.net/ref/1977/Gardner_RSA.pdf">Martin Gardner&#39;s &#34;Mathematical Games&#34; column</a> published in <em>Scientific American. </em>The article laid out the astounding details of what&#34;RSA,&#34; as it was called after its co-discoverers, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, made possible. Gardner omitted the technical details, but he offered his readers the opportunity to mail in a self-addressed stamped envelope to get a full description. The authors received 7,000 requests for the memo but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w704skq5q_8">didn&#39;t end up distributing</a> the paper because of the NSA&#39;s threats.</p>
<p>&#34;I decided quite literally that they are going to classify this over my dead body,&#34; Miller recalls. He traveled to MIT and got his hands on the unpublished paper describing how RSA worked. Then he went to &#34;a variety of different copy shops, so I wasn&#39;t making lots of copies in any one place&#34; and mailed them anonymously &#34;to home and hobbyist computer organizations and magazines all across the country.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I gave copies of the paper to some select friends of mine,&#34; Miller told <em>Reason</em>, &#34;and I told them, &#39;if I disappear, make sure this gets out.&#39;&#34;</p>
<p>The following year, the <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">RSA paper</a> was published in <em>Communications of the A.C.M.</em> &#34;And the world has been on a different course ever since it got published,&#34; says Miller.</p>
<p>But the crypto wars were just getting started. By the early 1990s, after the launch of the commercial internet and the web, RSA and public-key cryptography were no longer a rarified topic; they were privacy salvation. Internet users could use RSA to fully disguise their online activities from government spies. This sent the intelligence community once again scrambling to stop the dissemination of this powerful tool.</p>
<p>In 1991, a software developer named Phil Zimmermann released the first relatively easy-to-use, messaging system with end-to-end encryption, which was called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP. So the U.S. Justice Department launched a three-year criminal investigation of Zimmermann on the grounds that by making his software accessible outside the country, he could be guilty of exporting weapons.</p>
<p>The NSA made the public case that Zimmermann&#39;s software would be used by child molesters and criminals. &#34;PGP, they say, is out there to protect freedom fighters in Latvia,&#34; Stewart A. Baker, the NSA&#39;s general counsel, <a href="http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp94/encpanel.html/">remarked</a> during a panel discussion at the <a href="http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp94/home.html/">1994 Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy</a>. &#34;But the fact is, the only use that has come to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a guy who was using PGP so the police could not tell what little boys he had seduced over the &#39;net.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Child pornographers, terrorists, money launderers, take your pick—these are the people who will be invoked as the bringers of death and destruction,&#34; Tim May, a former Intel physicist and co-founder of the cypherpunk movement, told <em>Reason. </em>&#34;It&#39;s true&#34; that these individuals would make use of end-to-end encryption, May conceded, &#34;but all technologies have had bad effects. Telephones led to extortion, death threats, bomb threats, kidnapping cases. Uncontrolled publishing of books could allow satanic books to appear.&#34;</p>
<p>In his 1994 essay &#34;<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cyphernomicon.txt"><em>The Cyphernomicon</em></a>,&#34; May referred to terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers, and money launderers as &#34;The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse.&#34; This fearmongering was the government&#39;s main playbook for how &#34;privacy and anonymity [could] be attacked.&#34;</p>
<p>The cypherpunks argued that although PGP was encryption software, it was protected by the First Amendment because under the hood it was just a written series of instructions to be carried out by a machine.</p>
<p>The economist and entrepreneur Phil Salin was one of the first to argue this point in an influential 1991 essay titled &#34;<a href="http://philsalin.com/patents.html">Freedom of Speech in Software</a>.&#34; Salin wrote that &#34;[r]estraint on freedom of expression of software writers is anathema in a free society and a violation of the First Amendment.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Encryption can&#39;t be controlled whether or not it&#39;s powerful or has impacts on the government because it&#39;s free speech,&#34; says Gilmore, a co-founder of both the cypherpunk movement and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. In the 1990s, he risked going to jail in his campaign to force the government to acknowledge that regulating encryption violated the First Amendment.</p>
<p>&#34;We basically had a community of a thousand people scattered around who were all trying different ideas on how to get around the government to get encryption to the masses,&#34; Gilmore recalls.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration <a href="http://www.cyberwire.com/cwd/cwd.95.05.12a.html">noted</a> in a 1995 background congressional briefing that &#34;Americans have no constitutional right to choose their own method of encryption&#34; and pushed for legislation that would require companies to build in a mechanism for law enforcement agencies to break in.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption,&#34; then FBI Director</p>
<p>The cypherpunks looked for ways to undercut the government&#39;s case by pointing out the similarities between encryption software and other forms of protected speech. While under federal investigation for making his software available for download outside the U.S., to prove a point Zimmermann convinced MIT press to mirror his action in the analog world, by printing out the PGP source code, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262240394/reasonmagazinea-20/">adding a binding</a>, and shipping it to European bookstores.</p>
<p>&#34;MIT was at that time like three times as old as NSA, and it&#39;s at least as large a player in the national security community,&#34; says the cryptographer Whitfield Diffie, who co-discovered the concept of public-key cryptography on which RSA is based. &#39;It&#39;s one thing to try to go and step on little Phil Zimmermann; it&#39;s quite another thing to go after MIT.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The government knew if they went to court to suppress the publication of a book from a university that they would lose and they would lose in a hurry,&#34; Gilmore recalls.</p>
<p>&#34;There were people who actually got encryption code tattooed on their bodies and then started asking, &#39;Can I go to a foreign country?,&#39;&#34; Gilmore says. &#34;We printed up T-shirts that had encryption code on them and submitted them to the government office of munitions control…&#39;Can we publish this T-shirt?&#39; Ultimately, they never answered that query because they realized to say &#39;no&#39; would be to invite a lawsuit they would lose and so the best answer was no answer at all.&#34;</p>
<p>In 1996, the Justice Department announced that it wouldn&#39;t pursue criminal charges against Phil Zimmermann and major legal victories came in two separate federal court decisions, which found that encryption is protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>&#34;The crypto wars is still ongoing,&#34; says Gilmore. &#34;What we won in the first rounds was the right to publish it and the right to put it in mass-market software, but what we didn&#39;t actually do is deploy it in mass-market software. Now there are major companies building serious encryption into their products, and we&#39;re getting a lot of pushback from the government about this.&#34;</p>
<p>In the early 90s, at the same time that Gilmore was fighting his legal battle for freedom of speech in software, the cypherpunks were exploring cryptography&#39;s potential in the context of collapsing political borders and the rise of liberal democracy. Part four in <em>Reason&#39;s</em> series, &#34;Cypherpunks Write Code,&#34; will look at how those dreams turned to disillusionment, and the rebirth of the cypherpunk movement after the invention of bitcoin.</p>

      <title>The Elasticsearch Saga Continues</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
			
			<div>
				
				<p>First off, if you haven’t kept up with the saga of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline-mention" target="_blank" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Elastic</a>, here’s the briefest of recaps. A few years ago, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-the-fork-amazon/">AWS basically forked ElasticSearch</a> to offer it as a service, much to the open source community’s dismay. In response, and after some time, Elastic decided to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">change the licensing</a> on ElasticSearch earlier this year to restrict its downstream use, again, much to the open source community’s dismay. AWS then announced it would <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">fork the project to keep it fully open source</a>, suddenly <a href="https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-elasticsearch-turns-aws-into-the-open-source-champion/">becoming the apparent</a> good guy in the scenario. Finally, just a few months ago, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-aws-completes-elasticsearch-fork-with-opensearch/">AWS released OpenSearch</a> under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2), essentially completing the circle.</p>
<p>Well, until now.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thenewstack.io/amazon-elastic-and-the-fight-for-open-source-freedom-in-the-enterprise/">back and forth between ElasticSearch and AWS</a> continues this week, this time with Elastic making further attempts at closing off access to ElasticSearch and shutting out AWS. AWS, in response, has said that it is working on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/keeping-clients-of-opensearch-and-elasticsearch-compatible-with-open-source/" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">keeping clients of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch compatible with open source</a>.</p>
<p>AWS says that “OpenSearch aims to provide wire compatibility with open source distributions of Elasticsearch 7.10.2, the software from which it was derived,” making it easy to migrate to OpenSearch. While Elastic can’t do anything about that, they can make changes to some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">open source client libraries</a> that are commonly used.</p>
<p>“Over the past few weeks, Elastic added <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/pull/1623" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">new logic</a> to several of these clients that rejects connections to OpenSearch clusters or to clusters running open source distributions of Elasticsearch 7, even those provided by Elastic themselves. While the client libraries remain open source, they now only let applications connect to Elastic’s commercial offerings,” AWS writes.</p>
<p>If Elastic were looking to get back into the good graces of the open source community, this surely does not seem like the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/elastic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">@elastic</a> for making us all collateral damage in its war with <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">@awscloud</a>. It’s my bad for pinning dependencies as &gt;=7.0.0,&lt;8.0.0 and getting this update automatically on a deploy. But still, pretty crappy to break the ES python package for anyone using AWS. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/elasticsearch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">#elasticsearch</a> <a href="https://t.co/Vb5VatOXdl" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">pic.twitter.com/Vb5VatOXdl</a></p>
<p>— Brad Root (@amiantos) <a href="https://twitter.com/amiantos/status/1423063593541541890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">August 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Instead, AWS is again coming out as the savior of open source in this scenario, it would seem, this time promising to offer “a set of new open source clients that make it easy to connect applications to any OpenSearch or Elasticsearch cluster” that “will be derived from the last compatible versions of corresponding Elastic-maintained clients before product checks were added.”</p>
<p>“In the spirit of openness and interoperability, we will make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility with all Elasticsearch distributions, even those produced by Elastic,” they write.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while the OpenSearch community works on creating the replacement libraries, AWS recommends that users do not update to the latest version of any Elastic-maintained clients, lest their applications potentially cease functioning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Legitimately killing them with kindness. This is the type of moves that elasticsearch should be making because it’s in the best interest of the community. They have made their stance clear though. It’s about the money.</p>

<li aria-level="1"><strong>Facebook Open Sources Computational Integrity Tool:</strong> You Game of Thrones fans should be ultimately pleased with Facebook’s latest open source project <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/04/open-source/winterfell/" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Winterfell, a STARK prover and verifier</a>. Beyond the cultural reference, <a href="https://github.com/novifinancial/winterfell" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Winterfell</a> is an implementation of the <a href="http://cryptowiki.net/index.php?title=Zero-knowledge_Scalable_Transparent_Arguments_of_Knowledge_(zk-STARKs)#:~:text=Scalable%20transparent%20knowledge%20argument%20(STARK)%20as%20a%20STIK%20implementation,-In%20the%20past&amp;text=Two%20main%20transformations%20of%20evidence%20systems%20into%20realizable%20argument%20systems%3A&amp;text=Interactive%20STARK%20(iSTARK).,an%20interactive%20knowledge%20argument%20system." rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (STARK)</a> prover and verifier, and more specifically makes it possible for the average developer to “benefit from proofs of computational integrity (CI) that would normally require an in-depth knowledge of cryptography to implement.” CI proofs allow users to run a computation, get a result, and then “convince anyone that you did the computation correctly without their having to rerun the computation themselves.” A subset of this is the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), which allows the same functionality, while also obscuring the inputs. All of this becomes increasingly pertinent with the recent trend of blockchain, but Facebook writes that “ZKPs have numerous potential applications outside of the blockchain space as well” but they haven’t really taken off because of the expertise and computation required. “We developed Winterfell to bridge these gaps and to bring ZKPs within reach of regular developers,” Facebook writes in its blog post. Written in Rust, Winterfell has been released to <a href="https://crates.io/users/irakliyk" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Crates.io</a> and comes with an end-to-end <a href="https://github.com/novifinancial/winterfell#usage" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">tutorial</a> as well as an <a href="https://github.com/novifinancial/winterfell/tree/main/examples" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">examples crate</a>.</li>

<li aria-level="1"><strong>Rust Pushes for GATs Stabilization:</strong> In a blog post this week about <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/08/03/GATs-stabilization-push.html" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">the push for GATs stabilization</a>, Jack Huey, a member of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#wg-traits" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Traits Working Group</a>, assures their readers again and again that, whether they know it, understand it, or not, the move to add generic associated types (GATs) is “very exciting” and a “big deal,” indeed. Apparently, Rust has been trying to add GATs for quite some time now — the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">RFC</a> was first opened in April of 2016, predating even the push for const generics. And if you still doubt its importance, he points to the tracking issue on GitHub, noting it is the “most upvoted issue on the Rust repository.” The main news here is that the generic_associated_types feature is no longer “incomplete,” which means you will no longer get a warning if you’re trying to use it on the nightly build. For the full reasoning as to why this is important, and what exactly GATs are, head on over to the blog post to read about all the changes made to the compiler to get GATs to work, but beyond that, the team is looking to you to help stabilize the new feature. “We need you to test this feature, to file issues for any bugs you find or for potential diagnostic improvements. Also, we’d love for you to just tell us about some interesting patterns that GATs enable over on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits" rel="external " onclick="this.target=&#39;_blank&#39;;">Zulip</a>,” they write.</li>

More notably, according to RedMonk, is the relative stagnation of Go, Kotlin, and Rust, which it says “may reflect a new emerging reality of systems languages.” The three are grouped together as “would-be challengers for the title of enterprise application language of choice,” and RedMonk notes that Java does not seem to be going anywhere. “It seems plausible, therefore, that Java is retaining — through a combination of adaptability on its part and inertia on the enterprise’s — a large share of the enterprise applications market, meaning that its would-be challengers — languages like Go, Rust and to a lesser extent Kotlin because of the shared JVM platform — are competing less with Java than with each other,” they write. “If that hypothesis is correct, we should expect Java to sustain its performance and future gains from Go, Kotlin and Rust — if any — will be harder to come by as they compete for shares of a smaller pool of workloads.”</li>

							<h4>1775</h4>
<p>A year before independence, the Continental Congress creates the Postal Service—not as a government agency, but as one of several new independent alternatives to the British postal system. One advantage: This allows American dissidents to communicate without the authorities intercepting their letters.</p>
<h4>1835</h4>
<p>Southern mobs seize and burn abolitionist material sent through the mail. The postmaster general refuses to intervene, establishing a de facto policy of permitting the censorship of such literature in the slave states.</p>
<h4>1844</h4>
<p>The libertarian abolitionist Lysander Spooner establishes the private American Letter Mail Co. The government reacts by outlawing it, and in 1851 the experiment ends.</p>
<h4>1861</h4>
<p>The Civil War begins, and both the Union and the Confederacy adopt their own forms of postal censorship. The postmaster general spends a year refusing to deliver papers deemed disloyal to the Union cause.</p>
<h4>1873</h4>
<p>The Comstock Act makes it illegal to knowingly mail or receive any &#34;filthy book, pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character,&#34; as well as any contraceptives, any abortifacients, or any information about acquiring or using contraceptives or abortifacients.</p>
<h4>1878</h4>
<p>The Supreme Court upholds the government&#39;s right to bar &#34;circulars concerning lotteries&#34; from the mail—and, provided it has a warrant, to open and inspect packages to find such material.</p>
<h4>1887</h4>
<p>Police arrest the libertarian journalists Moses Harman, Edwin C. Walker, and George Harman for publishing and mailing a feminist argument against marital rape. The author&#39;s description of such an assault is deemed obscene under the Comstock Act.</p>
<h4>1917</h4>
<p>After the U.S. enters World War I, the Wilson administration cracks down on anti-war and anti-draft literature. In the case of the anarchist magazine <em>Mother Earth</em>, the government doesn&#39;t just bar the material from the mail—it arrests editor Emma Goldman for &#34;conspiracy to induce persons not to register&#34; for the draft, imprisons her, and eventually deports her.</p>
<h4>1944</h4>
<p>The government intercepts the international correspondence of tax resister Vivien Kellems—a prominent critic of the Roosevelt administration—and leaks it to columnist Drew Pearson and Rep. John M. Coffee (D–Wash.). Coffee quotes from it on the House floor while accusing Kellems of subversion.</p>
<h4>1953</h4>
<p>The CIA starts reading correspondence between people in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The covert program quickly extends to a much larger watchlist, with the agency illegally opening more than 13,000 letters a year until the operation ends in 1973.</p>
<h4>1970</h4>
<p>As part of its campaign against the underground press, the FBI considers a scheme to spray copies of <em>The Black Panther</em> with a chemical called Skatole before the issues are shipped to distributors, thus giving them &#34;a most offensive odor.&#34; The bureau drops that particular plan but finds other ways to harass alternative papers using the mails.</p>
<h4>2001</h4>
<p>In the wake of the post-9/11 anthrax attacks, the government creates the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking system to collect the information on the exterior of virtually everything mailed in the United States. One cybersecurity specialist later sums up the program for <em>The New York Times</em>: &#34;Let&#39;s record everyone&#39;s mail so in the future we might go back and see who you were communicating with.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>Research By:</strong> Slava Makkaveev</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Since 2007, Amazon has sold tens of millions of Kindles, which is impressive. But this also means that tens of millions of people could have potentially been hacked through a software bug in those same Kindles. Their devices could be turned into bots or their private local networks could be compromised, and perhaps even information in their billing accounts can be stolen.</p>
<p>The easiest way to remotely reach a user’s Kindle is through an e-book. A malicious book can be published and made available for free access in any virtual library, including the Kindle Store, via the “self-publishing” service, or sent directly to the end-user device via the Amazon “send to kindle” service.</p>
<p>The issues we found were reported to Amazon in February 2021 and fixed in the 5.13.5 version of Kindle’s firmware in April 2021. The patched firmware will be installed automatically on devices connected to the Internet.</p>
<h3>Kindle Touch architecture</h3>
<p>Basically, the Kindle OS is a Linux kernel with a set of native programs mainly provided by busybox, the LIPC subsystem for inter-process communication, and the Java and Webkit subsystems for user interface (UI) and services.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Kindle Touch architecture.</p>
<p>The LIPC is a D-Bus-based IPC library and its environment that links all Kindle components together. A Kindle process can use this library to start apps, expose application properties/settings, listen for or emit events. For example, a Webkit application, written in HTML and Javascript, can use the LIPC to interact with a Java service or a native application.</p>
<p>Most of the UI is written in Java. The Java subsystem (the framework) provides LIPC handlers for both services and the UI (so-called Booklets). For example, the Kindle home UI window is the <code>com.lab126.booklet.home</code> booklet managed by the framework.</p>
<p>The Webkit subsystem (HTML5 and Javascript) is another way to create UI elements. The built-in experimental browser is a part of the Webkit subsystem. The pillow is a library that allows access to the LIPC from Javascript.</p>
<h3>Who parses e-books?</h3>
<p>The latest version (5.13.4) of the Kindle e-reader firmware is publicly available for download on the official Amazon website. The source code is also partially available there. But the source code did not help in our research because it mainly consists of third-party open-source projects, including the Linux kernel, with small Amazon tweaks. There is no source code for the components responsible for parsing and rendering e-books.</p>
<p>Our first goal was to discover a vulnerability in the e-book parsing framework. For this we have enough files from the firmware and there is no need for a real Kindle device. </p>
<p>The <code>/mnt/us/documents</code> is the regular e-books’ directory, when you download a new book on your Kindle device. Who is going to handle the file first?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>File format</b></td>
<td><b>Extractor</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>kfx</td>
<td><code>/usr/lib/ccat/libyjextractorE.so</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>azw1, tpz</td>
<td><code>/usr/lib/ccat/libtopazE.so</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>azw, mbp, mobi, prc</td>
<td><code>/usr/lib/ccat/libEBridge.so</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the scanner does not match the file extension or a parsing error occurs, the e-book is not shown to the user. </p>
<p>After the scanner does its job, a thumbnail of the new book is displayed on the home screen. From this moment on, the Java framework is responsible for opening the book when you click on it. Java archive (JAR) files that implement the logic for opening and rendering e-books can be found in the <code>/opt/amazon/ebook/lib</code> firmware directory. Primarily, these are <code>MobiReader-impl.jar</code>, <code>YJReader-impl.jar</code>, <code>PDFReader-impl.jar</code>, <code>HTMLReader-impl.jar</code> and <code>TopazReader-impl.jar</code> files.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the implementation of the PDF book opening function in the <code>PDFReader-impl.jar</code> (<code>com.amazon.ebook.booklet.pdfreader.impl.PDFModel</code> class):</p>
<p>As you can see, this function is only a wrapper over the <code>nativeOpenPDFDocument</code> native function with the body in the <code>/usr/java/lib/libPDFClientJNI.so</code> library.</p>
<p>The <code>nativeOpenPDFDocument</code> function starts the PDF server <code>/usr/bin/pdfreader</code>, forking the process, and synchronously sends it an “openBook” message via the open source HTTP client/server library <code>/usr/lib/libsoup-2.4.so</code>. In fact, it sends a GET request to <code>https://127.0.0.1:7667/command/openBook</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>pdfreader</code> server is the main target of our research. Eventually, we will run our payload in the context of this process.</p>
<p>Note the following significant functions of the <code>libFoxitWrapper.so</code> library:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>openPDFDocumentFromLibrary(char *file, char* password, uint32_t* handle)</code> – Opens the PDF document.</li>
<li><code>getCurrentPage(uint32_t handle, uint32_t page, uint32_t flag)</code> – Parses the PDF page to internal structures.</li>
<li><code>renderPageFromLibrary(uint32_t handle, uint32_t page, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, float scale, uint8_t landscape, uint8_t* out)</code> – Renders the PDF page converting it to an image. When called, the stream filters begin to be parsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions are good entry points for fuzzing a PDF tree structure.</p>
<p>As the name implies, <code>libFoxitWrapper.so</code> is a wrapper for a popular Foxit PDF SDK presented on Kindle devices by the <code>/usr/lib/libfpdfemb.so</code> library. The <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> is a closed-source library proprietary to Foxit Software Inc. The Foxit Embedded PDF SDK manual can be found on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Fuzzing PDF filters</h3>
<p>We tried to fuzz the mentioned functions from the <code>libFoxitWrapper.so</code> library, but this approach did not bring any result, except for a set of null pointer exceptions. A more promising approach to the PDF format is to choose one specific object or stream filter as the target for the test. So, we decided to fuzz the <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> library.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a look at the classic fuzzing model.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to note one more thing. A Kindle device is based on an ARM processor. Therefore, our loader was compiled using <code>arm-linux-gnueabi-g++</code>. The Qemu easily emulates ARM on x86.</p>
<p>A simple search for the words “CPDF” and “Codec” in the <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> library allowed us to find all the possible stream filters/codecs: <code>Predictor</code>, <code>Decrypt</code>, <code>Flate</code>, <code>Fax</code>, <code>Lzw</code>, <code>AsciiHex</code>, <code>RunLen</code>, <code>Ascii85</code>, <code>Jpeg</code>, <code>Jbig2</code> and <code>Jpx</code>. Let’s take a look at one of them with an example.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Fragment of PDF page with jbig2 filter.</p>
<p>￼As you can see, an image <code>Im1</code> with jbig2 filter is declared. Jbig2 is an image compression standard for bi-level images. The jbig2 encoder segments the input page into regions: text, halftone images, refinement, and others. These regions are held in the <code>JBIG2Globals</code> stream. When rendering a PDF page, <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> parses the <code>JBIG2Globals</code> stream and reconstructs the image.</p>
<p>The <code>Jbig2Module</code> object, defined in the <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> library, is responsible for decoding jbig2 compressed images.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <code>Jbig2Module</code> object.</p>
<p>Its <code>StartDecode</code> method is declared as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>CVE-2021-30354. Heap overflow</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at the following <code>JBIG2Globals</code> stream:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two page regions are defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image information region (first 0x23 bytes). The image width is 0x80, the height is 1 and the stride is 0x10. The stride is calculated as <code>((width + 31) &gt;&gt; 5) &lt;&lt; 2</code>.</li>
<li>The “refinement” region (from 0x23 to 0x4D bytes). This region contains jbig2 encoded information to refine the image. As only a part of the image can be refined, it also contains the coordinates of the refining rectangle. In our case, the provided rectangle parameters are: width – 0, height – 0x10, x – 0, y – 0x40000000.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a malformed stream. An oversized rectangle is defined in the refinement region. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This means that by using refinement regions, we can “refine” the data outside of the image, and get the arbitrary write primitive. In the following example, the second refinement region overwrites 0x10 (stride) bytes at an offset 0x1234 * 0x10 bytes from the beginning of the image in the heap. The data blob (0x71 to 0x79 bytes) is decompressed by the jbig2 algorithm and then XORed with the heap content.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can create any number of refinement regions and overwrite parts of memory that are at a distance from each another. In addition, the fact that the writing is done through a XOR operation allows us to fix only specific bits of memory, but not whole words, and bypass ASLR protection if required.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the <code>libfpdfemb.so</code> library is part of the <code>pdfreader</code> process. The data and heap segments of this process are read/write/execute. ASLR is built into the Linux kernel and is controlled by the parameter <code>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code>. Its default value on Kindle devices is 1, which means the base address of the data segment is located immediately after the end of the executable code segment. In other words, there is no randomization for the data segment and the heap. These two facts make exploiting the discovered jbig2 vulnerability trivial.</p>
<h3>CVE-2021-30355. Improper Privilege Management</h3>
<p>We now have RCE vulnerability in the context of the <code>pdfreader</code> process. A user downloads the PDF book to his Kindle device. When the book is opened, a malicious payload is launched.</p>
<p>The <code>pdfreader</code> process has the framework user rights: <code>uid=9000(framework) gid=150(javausers) groups=150(javausers)</code>. It can send LIPC messages, access special internal files, but it is still limited. We want to be a root to reset all restrictions. </p>
<p>First, we jailbroke one of our Kindles because it is not enough just to have files from the firmware to search the logical LPE. We need to see running processes and opened ports, and to be able to debug Kindle services.</p>
<p>A software jailbreak for some versions of Kindle firmware can be found on the Internet. But the most general way is to jailbreak through the serial port. Although this requires disassembling the device, this is what we did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We got a jailbroken device, and then analyzed the services that have root rights, as well as the resources they access. Eventually, we found a logical error, or more accurately, an improper privilege management, in one of the Kindle services. Great, there is no need to fuzz the device drivers.</p>
<p>The framework user has full access to <code>/var/tmp/framework</code> directory, where he can create any executable file. Actually, this is the user’s working directory. For example, we can create a bash script file <code>payload.sh</code> that logs user privileges:</p>
<p>The framework user has read/write access to the <code>/var/local/appreg.db</code> sqlite database that is essentially an application registry. This means that we can fix a database entry using the <code>/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so</code> library or by simply editing the file. We want to patch one of the “command” entries in the <code>properties</code> table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, we can patch the entry <code>com.lab126.browser</code>: set the <code>value</code> field to <code>/var/tmp/framework/payload.sh</code> instead of <code>/usr/bin/mesquite</code>. The following SQL request does the work:</p>
<p>The framework can request the application manager, represented by the <code>appmgrd</code> service, to start an arbitrary application. We can send an LIPC message to open the browser app using the <code>/usr/lib/liblipc.so</code> library. This shell command does the same:</p>
<p>The application manager is responsible for launching built-in apps. To do this, it listens for the appropriate LIPC events. To start the browser app, it reads the entry <code>com.lab126.browser</code> from the <code>appreg.db</code>, and executes the command specified in the <code>value</code> field. As we patched this database entry, our <code>payload.sh</code> script is launched.</p>
<p>The <code>appmgrd</code> service has root rights. The “root: uid=0(root) gid=0(root)” string is logged by the <code>payload.sh</code>.</p>
<p>The described LPE vulnerability can be easily exploited from the <code>pdfreader</code> process that we owned. The <code>libsqlite3.so</code> and <code>liblipc.so</code> libraries are already loaded into the process memory. By combining the two discovered vulnerabilities, any malicious payload can be run as root.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We demonstrated how an e-book can function as malware. As the malware code is executed with root user rights, just opening such a book could have led to irreparable damage. The attacker could have deleted your e-books, potentially gain full access to your Amazon account, could have converted your Kindle to a bot, attacked other devices in your local network, and more.</p>
<p>The described vulnerabilities were reported to Amazon in February 2021 and fixed in the 5.13.5 version of Kindle’s firmware in April 2021.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="0000036">00:00:03.6</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.
</p>

<h2 id="0001256">00:01:25.6</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, my first work experience outside of academia was at a small company called LexiFi, where we were using OCaml to model financial contracts. So, in that context, OCaml was used mostly as a domain specific language to represent complex financial payoffs. I spent a couple years working on the overall infrastructure that we were selling to banks and asset managers. After that, I started working in 2010, at Goldman Sachs in London, as an equity strategist, and there I was using the in-house programming language called Slang, which one can think of as a variant of Python. It’s mostly a scripting language, it was fairly nice to actually quickly see the output of what you were doing, but of course, efficiency was a bit of a concern. I spent a couple years working at Goldman, and then in 2013, I joined Jane Street as a software developer. I worked mostly on trading systems at Jane Street, so back to using OCaml on mostly everything, and there I enjoyed a lot the functional programming aspects and strong type system, when it comes to designing production critical stuff. After four years and something at Jane Street, I actually left to go work for DeepMind, mostly because I was passionate about machine learning at that point, and I wanted to work at leading edge of the domain. At DeepMind, I used mostly Python to do machine learning and with of course, TensorFlow, and I also got to use Swift a bit as a replacement, potentially, for Python. I spent a year working there, and then I came back to work at Jane Street, where I focus more on researchy bits nowadays. So, I would say that I spend half of my time working in OCaml and half of my time working in Python, but these two halves are very different.</p>

<h2 id="0003546">00:03:54.6</h2>

<p>Another part of your background is you’ve also done some interesting work on the open source side, can you say a little bit about that.</p>

<h2 id="0004001">00:04:00.1</h2>

<p>So, I try to be active in the open source community, and through that I’ve had the opportunity to work on a couple of packages. The most notable one is probably <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch">ocaml-torch</a>, which provides OCaml bindings for the PyTorch framework. PyTorch is this amazing thing developed by Facebook, that lets you write some deep-learning algorithms in Python, and leverage your GPU and the power of auto-differentiation. Via these OCaml bindings, you can do that from OCaml, too – so, you add type safety to the mix. I also worked on <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs">Rust bindings</a> for it, so, it’s kind of the same thing; in this context, you have bindings in Rust, so rather than writing Python code, you end up writing Rust. I also worked a bit on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a>, which is a Rust static analyzer, and there, you try to analyze Rust code and find legitimate errors. There are plenty of other OCaml packages that I looked at – bindings for TensorFlow, bindings for Apache Arrow, I tried writing a data frame library for OCaml… and a couple other things. All of them can be found <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="0005177">00:05:17.7</h2>

<p>So, this all reflects that you’ve spent a bunch of time working in a bunch of different places using different languages and ecosystems. You mentioned along the way that here, about half of your time is spent working on Python and half it’s spent working in OCaml, and those two halves are very different. Maybe you can say a little bit more, how are those two different?</p>

<h2 id="0005361">00:05:36.1</h2>

<p>Yeah, the first half of my time is spent using Python, and that’s mostly for research purposes. In that context, I will use Python in a notebook. So, for people that don’t know what a notebook is, it’s a kind of web UI, where you have some cells where you input some lines of your programming language, most of the time Python, and you can evaluate each cell in order. The development mode is very interactive in this context. So, you look at the actual output, tweak your code a bit, then evaluate it again, then tweak your code again a bit because you notice that you’ve made some mistakes, and start over again, and again. So, it’s some kind of interactive development. What is fairly nice is that you have a very quick feedback loop between editing the code and seeing the actual outcome. And of course, it plugs very nicely with the very large Python ecosystem of plotting libraries. So, you can actually run your algorithm on some data, and then plug the output, check that it matches your intuition, if not, try to debug, tweak your code, and start over. So, that will be mostly what I use Python for, and on the other side, there is OCaml, and there, it’s for more [general] development work and production critical development, I would say, where you tend to build systems that are fairly resilient. What I’m often amazed by is that you write some OCaml job, you kind of spend a week on it, deploy it, and then you come back to it a few years later and maybe even you’ve left and come back along the way, and you notice that your job is actually still there and still working, which is pretty amazing. Of course, on the Python side, it’s a bit more rare that things would keep on working for a very long period of time.</p>

<h2 id="0007303">00:07:30.3</h2>

<p>Say more about why that is. What do you think it is about OCaml, that makes it easier for writing these kinds of more robust tasks, for catching bugs, all of that?</p>

<h2 id="0007303-1">00:07:30.3</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, I think there are two aspects actually to it. One, is about OCaml, and the other one is about the general engineering practice that we have  around OCaml. So, it turns out that when you write OCaml code, you usually write proper tests for your things, you think a lot about all the error cases. Again, part of it, because the type system will enforce that, and each function will tell you, oh, actually, I might return a result, but I might also return an error, and you have to think about what is the error is and how you want to handle it. Your goal is, build something that is a bit resilient, so you also are in a state of mind, where you think a lot about corner cases, whereas in the Python world, it’s more of about runtime exceptions. So, you don’t spend much time thinking about what the function actually outputs, and most of the time you use a library for which you don’t really know what the function outputs, it turns out that you kind of guess it, try it, most of the time it works, and you go on with that, you just check kind of interactively that it’s what you would expect.</p>

<h2 id="0008507">00:08:50.7</h2>

<p>I’m really struck by your description here. There’s a mix of differences between the two languages, and some of them are fundamental things about the language. Some of them are things about the ecosystem around the language, and some of them are issues about the practices that Jane Street as an organization has around the different languages. So, maybe we could just dig into those somewhat separately. Let’s first talk about the ecosystem. What is it about the Python ecosystem and the OCaml ecosystem that make them different?</p>

<h2 id="0009214">00:09:21.4</h2>

<p>Python, I think, nowadays, is kind of the de facto standard for everything that is about machine learning and data analysis. So, if you want to be able to plot your results, again, in a notebook, you have plenty of libraries that do that, plenty of tutorials online that will help you in finding the right way to do it, and if you run into any kind of issue, again, you can just Google things, you will get some results super easily. There is also a wide variety of machine learning libraries available, all the major modern deep-learning frameworks have Python frontends and are kind of released in a Python first manner, so the API that the developers will focus on is the Python one.  I don’t think that there originally was any very good reason for Python to be more successful than another language that’s also a bit similar [like Ruby], in that domain, but it turns out that the more you have an ecosystem, the more it attracts people and it snowballs at some point. On the other side, when it comes to a OCaml, there are a bunch of libraries. I think that, in general, libraries tend to have a bit of a better quality but you have far fewer of them. One way to get around this, is that you can bind to other languages, so that’s what we did for TensorFlow and PyTorch, but you can even bind to Python. So, we actually have some Matplotlib bindings when you want to plot something in OCaml, this will call Python which itself, will use this very well-known Matplotlib library to run those plots.</p>

<h2 id="0011118">00:11:11.8</h2>

<p>And I think it’s really notable that the first thing you talked about when you talked about the ecosystem advantages of Python is you talked about visualization, and I think the visualization part is incredibly important, and I think fundamental to why notebooks are such a valuable way of working. The basic mode in doing research is exploratory, you’re going off and trying something and looking at the results and trying something else, and looking at the results again, and having a quick workflow that lets you do that, and lets you embed the visualizations in your workflow in a straightforward way… I think that’s one of the reasons why notebooks are such a compelling way to work, and it’s very different from the traditional workflow in which software engineers work, which involves plain text and text editors, and just doesn’t have the same visualization component.</p>

<h2 id="0011589">00:11:58.9</h2>

<p>Indeed, though, I would say that these two modes are a bit similar in a way, that on both sides, you want to do fast iteration. In one case, you will have this fast iteration in the notebook. So, you will iterate quickly over the data, get some plot out, and get to actually visualize the output of your algorithm, check a bit some corner cases and iterate again. And in the OCaml world, you tend to do the same thing about fast iteration, but it’s about type safety. So, you save your file, and your build system will tell you, oh, this type doesn’t match, this type doesn’t match, this type doesn’t match. In the end, you would expect your OCaml code to pretty much work once you’ve managed to get things to compile. Whereas, on the Python side, you don’t have this type aspect. So, you’re kind of relying more on experiments to tell you if things are working properly.</p>

<h2 id="0012567">00:12:56.7</h2>

<p>I wonder if there’s more of this experimental back and forth on the OCaml world than maybe you’re giving it credit for. A place where I’ve encountered this a lot is in the work that we’ve done into building what are called expect tests. So, expect tests, which is a thing that’s not all that much known outside of the Jane Street context, although actually it was originally stolen from an external idea, the basic idea actually came from the testing tools that the Mercurial version control system uses – but anyway, the basic idea of expect test is you have this kind of unified way of writing code and tests, which in some ways feels a lot like a notebook. You write some piece of code, and then you write a special annotation, which means capture the output of the code up until here and insert it into the text of the code, and then you write some more code and have another place where you capture output. And then when the test runs, it regenerates all of the output and if there any changes, it says, “oh, the output is changed, do you want to accept the new version?” and then you can hit a key in your editor and load those new changes in, and we use that a lot for all sorts of different kinds of testing, but also for various kinds of exploratory programming. So, for example, a thing that I’ve done using this is to do web scraping: there’s some bit of web data you want to grab and analyze and transform and pull some information out of. And that’s very exploratory. You’re often not trying to get it right in a kind of universal way for all time, you’re trying to process some particular kind of documents, and so, you write some transformations, and you apply them and you look at the output and see if it makes sense, and the build system actually gives you a relatively good and fast loop. Where you go and you make a change and the build completes and you get to see the new output. One of the big differences, there’s no graphical component, everything is plain text. One of the big advantages you get out of the notebook style workflow is the ability to be in a webpage and actually display graphical stuff.</p>

<h2 id="0014455">00:14:45.5</h2>

<p>That’s right. I kind of agree that expect tests give you some kind of interactive experiments. There, I think you focus more on corner cases, and hard bits for you our algorithm, whereas, most of the time on the notebook experiment in Python, you’re not writing some code that is there for a very, very long time. So, you actually want it to work on your data rather than on any potential data. So, even if expect tests are a bit interactive, I think that it’s still a bit of a different experiment.</p>

<h2 id="0015292">00:15:29.2</h2>

<p>So, I’m curious, to what degree you think this is an issue of the programming language or an issue of the tools and ecosystem around the language. If, for a minute, we imagine a world where the tooling for using OCaml in a notebook was all really well worked out, you had all of the nice things you’re used to, from the editor integration experience we have with a language like OCaml, (so like, you can navigate to a piece of code and look up the type of a given expression or navigate to the definition of a given value, all of those things, all of those IDE-like features worked really well), and at the same time, you had all the benefits of using Python in a notebook in terms of the interactivity, and the ability to visualize things, and you had all of the machine learning and data analysis libraries at your disposal… At that point, is there still a reason that you’d want to use Python? Is there something about the language itself that makes it a better tool for some of this kind of exploratory research work?</p>

<h2 id="0016272">00:16:27.2</h2>

<p>Yeah. It’s a very interesting question. It’s, of course, a bit harder to answer definitively, because you don’t know what it will look like if you add everything possible on the OCaml aside. Still, I feel a bit that the dynamic aspects of Python have some advantages that you will not have, on the OCaml side. A typical thing that you will do in Python is you write your small algorithm, it actually works for integers, and you’re happy with it, but it turns out that later, you actually want to use floats. So, the fact that in OCaml, to make the type system happy, you will have to modify all the operations will be kind of annoying to you. Whereas, in Python, you would expect things to work most of the time. You will still have this problem that if there are some errors, you might not detect them, but on most reasonable outputs, the checks that you’ve done should bring you some confidence that it’s working reasonably well. And all these dynamic aspects are fairly nice. It lets you try pretty much any kind of algorithm on any data and relying on duck typing, as long as your object implements a proper method, things will work out without you actually knowing what’s taking place behind the hood.</p>

<h2 id="0017510">00:17:51.0</h2>

<p>I guess one of the big upsides of working in a language with a static type system is that types provide a lot of guarantees, guarantees that you can’t get from any single run of the program, you can’t get by any amount of testing, because the guarantees of type systems are essentially universal. They apply to every possible execution of your program. So, that’s an incredibly powerful thing, but it comes at a cost. Getting those guarantees requires you to effectively fit your program in to the structure required by the type system. Type systems are good at capturing some kinds of rules and not good at capturing others. So, there’s essentially a kind of negotiation step where you figure out how to play nicely with the type system. And in a language like OCaml, that actually works out pretty nicely. The type system is quite lightweight, it doesn’t require lots of type annotations, and it’s flexible. So, you don’t have to bend your program too far out of shape to make it fit in and to get the benefits of types, but the nice thing about dynamically typed languages is that you get to skip that negotiation step entirely. If your program works in the particular context on the data that you happen to be running on, then you don’t have to think about how it works in a more general context, and when you’re doing exploratory research, writing little bits of code that you get information from and then maybe never run again. I guess the tradeoffs are really different. At that point, being able to operate without types has a lot of appeal.</p>

<h2 id="0019167">00:19:16.7</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, the type system in OCaml would indeed give you a proof that your code is correct, and that the code is correct for all possible inputs, but in Python, it’s kind of the default that you don’t get any proof that your code would run correctly. You will only get exceptions at runtime. It turns out that the fragment of inputs that you’re caring about might be very small. So, the times that you would spend looking for corner cases on the OCaml side and fixing them, is actually not necessary on the Python side, because yourself, you know that you won’t have that kind of inputs. Whereas, of course, if you have a typer and a compiler to ensure type safety, the compiler cannot assume anything about that. So, you will have to teach it, “oh actually I don’t really care about this variant, nor about this variant” and so on.</p>

<h2 id="0020082">00:20:08.2</h2>

<p>I feel like we should be a little less grand in the sense that it’s not that the type system gives you a proof of the overall correctness of the program, but it does capture certain elements of correctness, and nails them down pretty well. And there’s certain kinds of programs where that gets you alarmingly far, where large classes of bugs just totally go away under the scrutiny of the type system. A thing that’s also maybe worth mentioning is that type systems like OCaml’s actually do relatively little to capture bugs in numerical code. One of the hard things about numerical programs is when you get the algorithm wrong, things look a little worse, in fuzzier ways. If you didn’t do your linear algebra decomposition <em>just right</em>, then it’s not that you get a totally crazy answer, you get an answer that’s less optimal, or doesn’t converge as fast or it doesn’t converge at all. And separating out those bugs, finding those bugs is actually quite hard, and I suspect if OCaml had a type system that was really good at finding that kind of bug, people would be really eager to use it in data analysis contexts, but in practice, the hardest bugs in numerical analysis often just kind of slip by without the type system helping you all that much at all.</p>

<h2 id="0021160">00:21:16.0</h2>

<p>Indeed, the bread and butter of Python is numerical algorithms, and in that case, pretty much everything is a float or an array of floats or matrix of floats. So, having a type system that checks that the types are correct might not buy you that much, as you mentioned, as problems are more likely to be the float value is not the correct one rather than the float is not a float, but it’s actually a string. So, in that context, the OCaml type system definitely helps less. You mentioned that you might want some specific type system to catch that kind of error, but that turns out to be quite tricky, even in being able to decide if a float is going to be a NaN, or is going to be an actual float, is not a straightforward problem, and yeah, that’s the kind of thing that by experiment, you will actually catch by looking at the data that you’re taking as input and trying your algorithm, but if you have to enter every possible data, you probably don’t want to check for floats, at any point in your function, it would be too much of a pain.</p>

<h2 id="0023398">00:23:39.8</h2>

<p>Right, and I feel like machine learning is split between two kinds of work, some of which is all about fast iteration, and some of which is all about painfully slow iteration, which is to say some of the work you do is taking some big model that you want to train and shipping it off to a farm of computers, and GPUs and such to do a bunch of heavy lifting, and then get the results back at the end, and that seems like a case where you would really, really like to not discover that after like three days of chomping on your numbers, that some trivial bug at the end causes the whole thing to fail, and you realize you were just wrong. That feels like a case where you’d actually rather have more checking up front, if you could get it. Is that a thing that comes up? And is that something where you think, OCaml can be useful in a machine learning context?</p>

<h2 id="0024241">00:24:24.1</h2>

<p>Yeah. I think that’s the kind of place where OCaml could be could be nice. Turns out that what will you tend to do in Python is you run your model first with very small input sizes, so that it runs quickly, and you run the whole thing, and you check that it’s able to write the model file in the end, or to write some intermediary snapshot files. But you can still miss some branching in your code, or whatnot, and so you don’t see that, at the end, your model would explode, and you might just not get anything out of multiple hours/days of compute, and in that case, you’re pretty sad. So, having a type system that tells you “oh actually here you say that the filename was supposed to be a string, it turns out that you’ve given me an int somehow,” it’s pretty good to be able to detect that kind of failure. Then it raises a bit the question of what is the ideal system, maybe the actual model should be in Python, because it’s the numerical bits, and you want to iterate quickly on building this model, but once it’s come to more either production usage or training for real, which is kind of a production thing, then you want an actual infrastructure around it, that is resilient about lots of things, so about some computer being down in your compute farm, about the file system having issues, and of course, about silly mistakes that you might have had in your code.</p>

<h2 id="0025545">00:25:54.5</h2>

<p>Are you suggesting in this world, you would keep the modeling in Python the whole way through, but just build the infrastructure around it in OCaml? Because taking the thing you wrote in Python and rewriting it again in OCaml doesn’t sound like an enormous amount of fun.</p>

<h2 id="0026079">00:26:07.9</h2>

<p>Yeah, and you might have discrepancies between the two things. I think it’s a bit clearer even when it comes to productionizing things. So, you write your model in Python, and even if you train it in Python, at some point, you’re probably going to want to use it on real life things. For Jane Street, it will mean that you might have a trading system that is actually using your thing, and this trading system is likely to be written in OCaml because it has to be resilient to lots of different things. And still, you will want to interface with your model at some point. So, you have multiple ways around that: You can either make OCaml call Python, and use that to decide on the model outputs, take the value back and process things accordingly. But you could also just try to replicate everything, so that things might be faster or you might have more type guarantees, but of course you have two different implementations. So, then you have a new problem, which is how do you ensure that the two implementations stay in line over time. It’s not something great to have, but we’ve done it for a couple things, and one way we have around that is, when you produce a model, the model outputs itself, like the configuration of weights that you’ve finally reached, as well as some sample values, and on the OCaml side, when you deploy the actual model, you will run with the configured weights and the sample values and check that you obtain the exact same results.</p>

<h2 id="0027430">00:27:43.0</h2>

<p>Some of what you were talking about there had to do with the tooling that we have for calling back and forth between Python and OCaml, and that’s actually an area that you’ve done a bunch of work on. So, can you say a little bit more about what we’ve done to make interoperability between the two languages better?</p>

<h2 id="0027599">00:27:59.9</h2>

<p>Yeah. For that, we rely a lot on a library called <a href="https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml">pyml</a> which is open source and which is very neat. This library, it’s mostly designed so that you can call Python from OCaml. So, again, a typical example is you want a plotting library in OCaml. So, you want to use Matplotlib because, it has its own issues, but it has tons of features, and it works fairly well. So, you just call on the Python runtime from your OCaml runtime, but it turns out that you can also use it the other way around, and it’s the kind of use case that we have the most of at Jane Street. When you write things in your Python notebook, you want to be able to access the various Jane Street services, to get some market data, to get, actually all the data that you can think of, in your Python notebook and even to trigger some actions or to publish some values to all different systems. So, for that, it’s more calling OCaml from Python and again with pyml, what you can do is compile your OCaml code in a shared library and this shared library you would load it from the Python runtime, you will code the starting point of the OCaml code, which would bring up the OCaml runtime and the OCaml runtime will register lots of functions for the Python runtime to be able to use. This makes it possible to actually write Python wrappers around OCaml functions in a way where you almost don’t have to write a single line of Python. So, for people that do not use Python that much, that’s very nice and also, when you want to build functions that are used a lot by lots of different people on inputs that you might not have thought of, you’re actually pretty happy to do that in the OCaml world rather than to do it in the Python world.</p>

<h2 id="0030005">00:30:00.5</h2>

<p>And the key reason it’s important to do this without writing any Python is: there are lots of OCaml developers who are developing libraries, that would be useful to Python programmers who themselves basically don’t use Python at all. So you want keep down the amount of work that’s required for non-Python developers to explore things and make it available to the Python world.</p>

<h2 id="0030192">00:30:19.2</h2>

<p>Yes. Because if people don’t run the Python command line to test things or write small wrappers on a daily basis, they might not remember how to do it, it’s a bit of a pain. Whereas, if you do everything on the OCaml side, people in the development area are very familiar with doing that.</p>

<h2 id="0030465">00:30:46.5</h2>

<p>Right, and it’s maybe worth noting, that this is a kind of thing that we’ve done in multiple different places, what you’re describing is the ordinary thing that you have in any kind of higher order language, whether that’s a functional programming language, or an object-oriented language, where you’re essentially shipping around pointers to bits of code, and it’s pretty common to have things which, when you stop and think about them, they’re just calling back and forth multiple times across these different levels, and then, what’s interesting about it in a Python context is we’re now calling back and forth between two different language runtimes, not just between two different functions in the same language. And we do exactly this for our OCaml Emacs integration. With Emacs, we wanted to write lots of extensions, but we really didn’t want to write them in the native language that Emacs uses for this called elisp. Because people found it harder to test, harder to teach and harder to engineer, and so we wrote this layer called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/ecaml">Ecaml</a>, and now pretty much all of our Emacs extensions are written in OCaml, but you still need to interop with the basic Emacs functionality and library, so, in that sense, it’s very similar to the Python story, and you have exactly the same story where you have programs that are constantly bouncing back and forth between OCaml and between Emacs Lisp in that case, and hilariously, we’re now doing the same thing with <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/vcaml">Vim</a>. So, you have the same kind of technology getting built over and over.</p>

<h2 id="0032121">00:32:12.1</h2>

<p>It’s pretty amazing when you build that kind of system, and you notice, the first time that it works. It sounds pretty weird that somehow, you’re able to interface that, having layers of Python calling OCaml calling Python calling OCaml, and somehow, even if you do that hundreds of times, it ends up just working. Though there are some nasty aspects to it. When doing the integration of some OCaml function, we actually run into a pretty funny bug because of that, which was as follows: OCaml has a garbage collector, so the OCaml runtime from time to time, stops the world and collects what is not alive. Here, by “alive”, we mean the values that can be reached by their runtime, so it’s also values that are actually useful to the user still at that point and all the rest is the garbage that can be collected and removed. Whereas, in the Python world, you use reference counting, so on each object, you keep a counter of how many times this is used, it has nice benefits that you can really see as soon as possible, but it has a slightly sad aspect which is if you have a cycle, then memory is lost. So, you still need a garbage collector that you run from time to time to detect cycles and to actually remove them and the bug that we actually encountered was because you had a cycle between the Python and the OCaml runtime. So, you had an OCaml object that was itself pointing at a Python value and the Python value was pointing back to the OCaml thing, and that thing cannot be detected by either of the garbage collector. Each of them will tell you, “oh, actually, that thing is being used, I don’t want to remove it”, but overall, you could remove the old value. It turns out that this was wasting tens of megabytes because of that and so we noticed it pretty quickly and fixed the thing, but there are some small drawbacks that you can have because of this.</p>

<h2 id="0034237">00:34:23.7</h2>

<p>This is exactly the classic problem you get when you have two garbage collectors interacting, and we have exactly the same bug in the Ecaml story. So, I think it is a fundamental problem that’s hard to fix. </p>

<h2 id="0034484">00:34:48.4</h2>

<p>Myself, I would think that when things are there to last, and it’s some code that you want to still be working in multiple weeks, or months, then OCaml is very neat. Also, there are specific domains where OCaml shines when it’s about manipulating symbolic values. Of course, trying to do that, in Python would probably not be that much of a good idea. One good example of manipulating symbolic values is writing a syntax extension. In that case, OCaml’s type system does a really good job of helping catch errors in code that’s going to inspect your program and generate new code depending on what it finds, and making sure that you don’t forget to handle all the different kinds of syntax that show up in the language.</p>

<h2 id="0035307">00:35:30.7</h2>

<p>Although I’d say that the kind of example you gave about writing programs that manipulate programs is both a very good example in the sense that it highlights something OCaml’s really good at, but also, I feel like, in some ways, a bad example, because I think it understates how often this kind of programming comes up. To try and frame it in a somewhat more general context: I feel like the kind of places where OCaml works really well is where you have combinatorial structure that involves just differentiating between lots of different cases. If there’s different ways that your data might be laid out, and you want something that helps you do the case analysis and make sure that you capture all the cases. OCaml’s incredibly good at that. OCaml’s pattern matching facility gives you a way of just exhaustively saying, “what are all the different ways this data might be shaped” and making sure that you cover them all. That for sure shows up and shows up a lot when you’re doing compiler style work, or generally things that kind of feel more like program manipulation, but actually shows up a lot in various kinds of systems programming tasks; I’ve spent a lot of time working on the insides of trading systems, for example. And there’s actually lots of places where you want to think in exactly this kind of combinatorial way and where things like OCaml, do a really good job of catching those bugs.</p>

<h2 id="0036428">00:36:42.8</h2>

<p>Yeah, yeah, it’s definitely the case. You mentioned trading systems, and indeed, it’s quite challenging. Building trading systems in Python is not the best idea.</p>

<h2 id="0036544">00:36:54.4</h2>

<p>You were talking before about how we build tools to make it possible to call into OCaml from Python, and the kind of examples you pointed to are cases where you want to consume data where the primary wrapper of that data is some bit of OCaml code or to publish data, again, through some path that’s in OCaml, but I think it’s also useful to be able to invoke computations, pure computations that exist on the OCaml side, I think for two reasons. One is, because it’s way more efficient, as you’ve been highlighting, but also because writing the code, inside of our ecosystem, writing the code in OCaml means that you can write the program once, write the computation once, and then share it on both sides. Being able to have all of the core computational stuff available on the OCaml side and then being able to expose it in Python is a nice way to allow you to stop repeating yourself and having to rewrite things on both sides.</p>

<h2 id="0037442">00:37:44.2</h2>

<p>Yeah. Efficiency’s definitely something that we care about, and that would be far better on the OCaml side. Also, if some code is indeed to be called by lots of different people, and again, these people might have ways to call it that you will not have thought about, in Python, it will be pretty challenging, because your test suite will have to cover pretty much every single corner case, and still people might at some point rely on some specificities of your code, and wrap around that, which ends up being quite a mess. You don’t want to write in Python some code that is going to be queried in lots of different usage scenarios. Whereas in OCaml, you’re kind of forced by the type system to think about all these different scenarios and you want to get that correct. It’s not worth investment for a one-off, but if it’s for some code that is going to be shared across tons of people, it’s probably worth more of the investment.</p>

<h2 id="0038495">00:38:49.5</h2>

<p>When people think about the difference between dynamically typed languages and statically typed languages, they often think of, well, in statically typed language, you have the type system to help you and in dynamically typed languages, you have to write a lot of tests, which is, I think, not quite the right way to think about it. I think in a statically typed language, you still need tests, but they have almost a kind of snap-in-place property, which is: if you write your program, and can show that it works on a few key cases and catch a few of the corners, then the overall behavior tends to snap into place, and you get, almost like, wider coverage of your tests, by having the type system make the behavior of the program in some sense more rigid, and so, then you can just get by with a much lighter testing story. So, you still need to do tests, but you don’t have to be nearly as exhaustive in the testing, as you do in a language where tests are the only thing that are nailing the behavior of your program in place. </p>

<h2 id="0040177">00:40:17.7</h2>

<p>Yeah. We are certainly learning a lot on the Python side, on the OCaml side, things have been polished by the years, and are very, very efficient. On the Python side we are discovering – testing – having a bit of type annotation, and generating automatically user documentation and so on, and you have to pretty much redo all the things that have been done for OCaml at Jane Street. So, we are going through that and trying to focus first on the most important bits, but we’re certainly not there, and I can imagine that our best practices are pretty far away from people that are doing lots of Python. I also think that when it comes to actually using Python not alone to build your system, but more as some kind of glue around some OCaml components, the testing story probably has to be less involved on the Python side. You still want your OCaml components to be well tested. You still want your intermediary layer that converts Python calls into OCaml calls to be of course properly tested. But you have far less of a possibility of bugs on the Python side because what we ship on the Python side is fairly limited. After that, the user is going to write 10s of lines, perhaps a bit more around it. But hopefully, not so much that there will be tons of possibilities for bugs. Though, we’re quite commonly surprised about how easy it is to sneak some bugs in a very, very short amount of code.</p>

<h2 id="0041101">00:41:10.1</h2>

<p>That is a thing about which programmers will never stop being surprised.</p>

<h2 id="0041139">00:41:13.9</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s pretty impressive, and it’s also impressive when you start to rely on Python libraries. So, of course, we rely a lot on something called NumPy to represent multidimensional arrays, and also a data frame library called Pandas that lets you represent a matrix where each column has a heterogeneous type, and you can have a column of strings, a column of times, a column of floats.  And this library is super powerful. It works very nicely. It lets you analyze your data very quickly, but it has very weird corner cases, and you might just notice that the code is actually not doing what you would expect and learn it the hard way. Because the only thing you noticed in the end is, oh, the error that I get while honing my simulation is not what I would have expected… it’s pretty bad. So, now I have to dig down in my code, annotate things quite a lot, and try to understand why the input and output of this Pandas library is not what I would expect, to finally Google that and discover that it’s a well-known gotcha around the library. That’s only for the case that we know about where the error was large enough for us to discover, of course; you have cases where you won’t even know about it.</p>

<h2 id="0042264">00:42:26.4</h2>

<p>This reminds me a little bit of what data analysis is like in Excel. Excel is something like the equivalent of the Python notebook. The program that you write in there is a mix of the little expression language that goes into the cells of a spreadsheet, and VBA that you write, for manipulating and doing various things that don’t look like simple computations that go along with it. Again, it has all the benefits that we were talking about, which is, it gives you some ability to visualize the data, this cell structured way of looking at computations, is actually in some ways, incredibly powerful. You look at someone who’s good at a spreadsheet, they’re able to very quickly do all sorts of rich computations in a way where they can see all the intermediate pieces and in the transformation the numbers become actually much easier to follow through because all of intermediate computations just kind of laid out in a big grid. And also, it has a bunch of baked-in totally terrifying, weird behaviors. I’m reminded of this recent news where some organization in the academic genomics community changed the names they used for various objects that show up in spreadsheets, because I think some of them were being interpreted as dates, which caused all sorts of crazy things to happen in the middle of spreadsheets. </p>

<h2 id="0044376">00:44:37.6</h2>

<p>Myself, I tend to make a lot of fun about Excel, because I live in the Linux land, I don’t like logging on a Windows computer. I don’t use Excel almost at all, but still, when you go and see, when you have a question for someone working on trading at Jane Street, and you see them manipulating Excel, it’s pretty impressive, because people tend to know all the shortcuts, and are able very, very quickly to actually get their data out of Bloomberg, plot them in Excel, and basically check that the values are in line with what they would expect and just send them to you. Whereas, if you were to have written OCaml code for that, you would probably have spent multiple hours on it. So, yeah, Excel definitely has its advantage, it also has a great reactive model, like having these cells, when where you modify your cell, everything gets recomputed, and that’s very nice. Python is definitely kind of in the middle, you’re able to do more computations there, it’s a bit more efficient, and it can handle larger data sets, but you lose a bit of the, oh, I can basically eyeball all the data at once. Of course, in Python at some point, what you’re manipulating is too big, so you only look at statistics and the extremums, that kind of thing. So, it’s far less good than what it will be when using Excel.</p>

<h2 id="0046054">00:46:05.4</h2>

<p>Also, Python notebooks lack a nice property that Excel spreadsheets have where in Excel spreadsheets, every cell is a computation, which makes references to other cells, and Excel keeps track of this graph of computations and how they depend on each other. That’s useful both for performance reasons – there’s this kind of incremental update, if I change something, it will refresh the computation, and just do the minimum that it needs to do to refresh things, so, it has a nice built in incremental computing model – but it’s also good for correctness reasons, it can actually refresh all the things that need to be refreshed whenever anything changes, so you know that your spreadsheet is in a consistent state. Not so with a Python notebook. In a Python notebook, you have something similar, you have like little chunks of code, which are almost like the equations, and then you have various visualizations that are interspersed between them, and these chunks of code depend on each other, but you have little buttons you can press to decide which ones to rerun when, and so you can look at a notebook, and you have no guarantee that it’s in a consistent state, and so that’s a thing that’s always struck me as kind of nerve-wracking about this model of programming.</p>

<h2 id="0047107">00:47:10.7</h2>

<p>Excel tends to be more functional than what Python would be. You have far less of a notion of state that can be mutated, it’s just this graph of computation, and that’s actually fairly neat. A big problem with notebook is what you mentioned: you can run each cell, cell may depend on the current state, and it’s very easy to create a notebook state and not remember how you actually reached that state, you might have executed a cell multiple times, and you might have executed the third cells before executed the second one, and you would have to redo everything again, if you wanted to be able to go back to the exact same state. So, for efficiency reason, you don’t want to keep this big graph and rerun everything, but it’s kind of a problem because when you reach some confusion from your notebook, if you’re not able to restart from scratch and rereach the same conclusion easily, it’s actually annoying.</p>

<h2 id="0048093">00:48:09.3</h2>

<p>Is there any work in the direction of trying to solve this problem with notebooks to make it so you could have notebooks that had more natural incremental models so that you didn’t have to choose between efficiency on one side and correctness on the other, pick one? Is there any work to try and make that better?</p>

<h2 id="0048263">00:48:26.3</h2>

<p>Yeah. I think there is a bit of work but nothing that has a level of adoption of the main Jupyter/iPython thing. So, a thing that can be mentioned, there is an alternative to Jupyter, which is called Polynote which is made by Netflix, I think. It has the same kind of drawbacks, except that it’s far more explicit about the notion of state. So, at least, you would see the variables that you’re seeing defined, and when you go back to a cell, it tries to put you back in the state that you had when editing this cell, so only taking into account what was there previously. But of course, because you want to do that efficiently, you don’t really handle aliasing correctly. So, if you’re doing deep mutation inside the object, I don’t think that this is tracked down properly and just kind of the first layer of object is as it was at that point in time.</p>

<h2 id="0049215">00:49:21.5</h2>

<p>I see. So, it tries to bring you back, but it’s not a sound method, it’s not guaranteed to always work.</p>

<h2 id="0049272">00:49:27.2</h2>

<p>Yeah, because it would explode probably.</p>

<h2 id="0049298">00:49:29.8</h2>

<p>Right.</p>

<h2 id="0049306">00:49:30.6</h2>

<p>Besides that, there is a nice thing, but it’s very experimental at this stage, in the Julia world, which is called Pluto. It will notice all the dependencies, and whenever you edit a cell, it will recompute all the cells that are depending on the results. So, this works, I think, only for Julia at this stage, but it’s pretty neat. It might be the case that you want to rerun a cell and not rerun things that would be too long to run. So, it’s a bit of a user interface problem at some point.</p>

<h2 id="0050134">00:50:13.4</h2>

<p>Yeah. Although, I guess you could just be explicit, you can say I reran the cell, and now if I could keep track and visually notify the user that the following cells are, in some sense out of date. At least if you understood and could expose to the user, so they knew which part of the computations were reliable and which parts were not reliable, that would already move you a big step forward.</p>

<h2 id="0050533">00:50:53.3</h2>

<p>The idea there is indeed a differentiable programming. So, what you tend to do a lot in modern machine learning is doing gradient descent. So, you have a function that you want to optimize, so it does some parameters and you want to find optimal values for these parameters. You have a notion of loss, and you want to find the parameters that minimize this loss. And the way to do that is by gradient descent. So, you would just use the Newton method of computing the derivative, except that in this case, the derivative is with respect to lots of different variables and you follow the slope down until you think you have reached the minimum. So, of course, what you discover is a local minimum.</p>

<h2 id="0051393">00:51:39.3</h2>

<p>Right, and for people who don’t spend a lot of time doing machine learning, the way I always think about this is, you have some function you want to evaluate, think of it as like a series of hills or whatever, and gradient descent is just like the thing that like a rolling ball does, it just goes in the steepest direction, instead of being at the top of a hill, you’ll find yourself at something that looks like a bowl in its shape and that’s exactly a local minima. Having the ability to compute the derivative, particularly in a very high dimensional context, where instead of being you know, a two dimensional picture like the one I have in my head, you have 200 dimensions, or 2 thousand dimensions or more, having that derivative there is a very powerful thing.</p>

<h2 id="0052168">00:52:16.8</h2>

<p>If you were to compute the gradient numerically, that would work with a couple dimensions, but if you have a model that has millions of parameters, you don’t want to compute the gradients numerically. So, having symbolic gradients is far better and that’s where differential programming is actually very helpful. So, you can either use a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which will build the graph of the computation for you, and do the symbolic derivation of this computation graph. But you can imagine pushing that one step further, and just doing that at the compiler level. So, at this point, where you define a function to take as input lots of float values, and returns a float, you can imagine that automatically, you generate the gradient for this function, because as a compiler you know that this function is combining the addition with some subtraction, and lots of other functions for which you might have already computed to gradient.</p>

<h2 id="0053209">00:53:20.9</h2>

<p>To maybe make this more concrete for people, the notion of symbolic differentiation is basically exactly the kind of differentiation you ran into in your calculus class. You know, there were a bunch of rules that you could apply, you write down some expression, and there are rules like the derivative of x squared is 2x and rules about multiplication and addition and composition. It turns out this actually very old insight about programming languages – so called automatic differentiation is 30 years old – it showed up in lots of languages in the past, including ancient implementations in Fortran, and Lisp, gives you a way of just saying, oh, let’s just take this idea and generalize it and apply it to programs, not just programs that represent simple expressions, but programs that do iteration and recursion and all sorts of crazy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="0054016">00:54:01.6</h2>

<p>Yes, and of course, there are lots of challenges along the way, because it’s easy to differentiate an addition and multiplication, and the composition of multiple functions, but you have functions that are far harder to differentiate. You mentioned, oh, I code my function recursively. Or I might have an if branch, things that are kind of discrete, rather than continuous, and then you have to decide about what is the proper differentiation for that. So, it turns out that modern machine learning based models, combine functions that are all reasonably easy to differentiate. So, if you just write a model in a programming language that supports automatic differentiation, you will actually not need the library to compute the gradient for you, the compiler will return you the gradient because you only used operations that were easy to differentiate and being able to compose that for pretty much all the function in your program, that might let you optimize things that you didn’t think you would be able to optimize.</p>

<h2 id="0055359">00:55:35.9</h2>

<p>The work you’re talking about is trying to take this idea of automatic differentiation and apply it to Swift. Can you say a little bit more about what kind of language Swift is and why people looked at Swift as the language for doing this?</p>

<h2 id="0055485">00:55:48.5</h2>

<p>Swift is a programming language that originated from Apple as a replacement for Objective C, and the person that worked on it, Chris Lattner, was working at Google. He focused on what could we do with modern programming language theory in the machine learning world. And it turns out, he tried a few languages, and he tried what can I do with Swift? What can I do with Haskell? What can I do with the Rust? What can I do with Julia? And it ended up being Swift that was selected to build a prototype, which was probably a good choice, because he was leading the project and was very familiar with it. So, Swift is a compiled language. It has some very nice, functional aspects. So, you have the equivalent of type classes, except that it’s called, I think, protocols, it feels like you have sum types. It feels like a modern programming language.</p>

<h2 id="0056492">00:56:49.2</h2>

<p>The sense I get is a mash up between something like Objective C and something in the Haskell, OCaml, F# kind of world, right? I think the Objective C stuff was kind of just needed, fundamentally, to be compatible with the whole iOS world.</p>

<h2 id="0057109">00:57:10.9</h2>

<p>Yeah, I think that’s indeed the case. There is this, “I want to be able to be attractive to Objective C users and to interact with Objective C systems”, but besides that, it has lots of modern features and feels quite close actually, to OCaml, when it comes to the type system. And yes, Swift is compiled, it compiles down via LLVM, and there is a project that people were looking at and are still looking at Google is, let’s take some Swift code and rather than compiling it for CPU, let’s compile it for different hardware, let’s compile it for a GPU. So, we know that in this Swift code that I’ve written, I have some big matrix multiplication, addition and so on, and I don’t want to actually target a CPU for that, I want to target a GPU, or even these fancy TPUs that you can rent from Google online. </p>

<h2 id="0059182">00:59:18.2</h2>

<p>Is there a reason that Swift is a better language to try this in than Python?</p>

<h2 id="0059218">00:59:21.8</h2>

<p>Python is, again, very dynamic, and very stateful. Swift is closer, as we said before, to OCaml, and to something functional. So, you have less of a notion of a state, you tend to have more pure functions, and computing derivatives, of course, would make more sense in a world of pure functions, than it would, if you start having some state. Also, the compiler has far more information about what the function does. It doesn’t mean that it’s not possible to do in Python, actually, a framework like PyTorch, lets you annotate Python functions with just-in-time information that tells the PyTorch framework to try to compile the function and compile it’s backward pass from the actual Python representation of the syntax tree.</p>

<h2 id="0101457">01:01:45.7</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s right. In fact, we’re looking at doing very similar things in OCaml. We’ve actually, shockingly enough hired someone where a big part of their goal is trying to get the work on algebraic effects to get completed where, not to go into too much, but algebraic effects is another kind of type system level feature, which among other things will make it possible on top of it to build things that look more or less like management of resources, and in many ways lets you capture some of the same resource management that languages like Rust have. And I think this goes back to the basic fact that garbage collection is great for managing memory, and managing the one big resource of the shared memory that your whole program uses, but garbage collection is a terrible way of managing other kinds of resources. A classic example that you don’t need to think about machine learning to understand is file handles, like sometimes people will set up their programming language so that their files will get closed when the garbage collector gets rid of the files, but that’s terrible because it turns out, you have some shockingly low limit on the number of open file descriptors you can have, and your program will just crash because suddenly you can’t open files anymore, because your garbage collector didn’t feel like it had to work that hard to collect memory, and therefore wouldn’t collect this other completely different resource of file handles. So, for things like file handles, or GPU memory, or various other kinds of external resources, where there aren’t just like another chunk of memory on the heap, you really want something else.</p>

<h2 id="0103106">01:03:10.6</h2>

<p>Yeah. Yeah. I feel that it would be very amazing to have that kind of possibility in the OCaml world, at some point. Every scarce resource indeed, you don’t really want the GC to be accountable for it, and you want it to be grabbed as eagerly as possible. </p>

<h2 id="0104227">01:04:22.7</h2>

<p>It’s obviously ongoing work, but I’m pretty excited about having OCaml being a system where, by default, you have a garbage collector, but that you can, in a focused way where you want to do precise resource management, have it checked and enforced at the level of the type system, and my hope is that that will end up being a system which gives you a lot of the things that are most attractive about Rust, but is all-in more ergonomic, because you don’t have to do the extra work of thinking about explicit tracking of the memory, except in the cases where you really need to do it. But obviously, this is like future stuff, things we’re hoping to get to, but it’s all vaporware at this point.</p>

<h2 id="0104583">01:04:58.3</h2>

<p>Having a world where the default is actually, you have a reference counting, or you have a GC, but only for some resources you have actual proper tracking of the memory, that would seem like the ideal thing to me.</p>

<h2 id="0105545">01:05:54.5</h2>

<p>Yeah, and if I remember correctly, Rust actually started the other way around. The earliest versions of Rust, I think, did have a garbage collector in there, baked into the core system, and over time they got removed and garbage collection became a library that you could add on. One thing to say about all of this is, this is in some sense, cutting edge stuff, and there’s a big design space, and I think we as a community of people working on programming languages are just starting to explore it.</p>

<h2 id="0106211">01:06:21.1</h2>

<p>Yeah, and there are some ways around it in the language, but having it properly supported inside OCaml will be neat.</p>

<h2 id="0106318">01:06:31.8</h2>

<p>Well, thank you for joining me. That was a really fun and unexpectedly wide-ranging conversation.</p>

<h2 id="0106387">01:06:38.7</h2>

<p>Thank you for having me.</p>

	Looking to such specialized nervous systems as a model for artificial intelligence may prove just as valuable, if not more so, than studying the human brain. Consider the brains of those ants in your pantry. Each has some 250,000 neurons. Larger insects have closer to 1 million. In my research at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, I study the brains of one of these larger insects, the dragonfly. I and my colleagues at Sandia, a national-security laboratory, hope to take advantage of these insects&#39; specializations to design computing systems optimized for tasks like intercepting an incoming missile or following an odor plume. By harnessing the speed, simplicity, and efficiency of the dragonfly nervous system, we aim to design computers that perform these functions faster and at a fraction of the power that conventional systems consume.
</p><p>
<strong>Looking to a dragonfly</strong> as a harbinger of future computer systems may seem counterintuitive. The developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning that make news are typically algorithms that mimic human intelligence or even surpass people&#39;s abilities. Neural networks can already perform as well—if not better—than people at some specific tasks, such as detecting cancer in medical scans. And the potential of these neural networks stretches far beyond visual processing. The computer program<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/deepmind-achieves-holy-grail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>AlphaZero</u></a>, trained by self-play, is the best Go player in the world. Its sibling AI,<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/deepminds-ai-shows-itself-to-be-a-worldbeating-world-builder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>AlphaStar</u></a>, ranks among the best<em> Starcraft II </em>players.
</p><p>
	Such feats, however, come at a cost. Developing these sophisticated systems requires massive amounts of processing power, generally available only to select institutions with the fastest supercomputers and the resources to support them. And the energy cost is off-putting.
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>Recent estimates</u></a> suggest that the carbon emissions resulting from developing and training a natural-language processing algorithm are greater than those produced by four cars over their lifetimes.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">It takes the dragonfly only about 50 milliseconds to begin to respond to a prey&#39;s maneuver. If we assume 10 ms for cells in the eye to detect and transmit information about the prey, and another 5 ms for muscles to start producing force, this leaves only 35 ms for the neural circuitry to make its calculations. Given that it typically takes a single neuron at least 10 ms to integrate inputs, the underlying neural network can be at least three layers deep.</small>
</p><p>
	But does an artificial neural network really need to be large and complex to be useful? I believe it doesn&#39;t. To reap the benefits of neural-inspired computers in the near term, we must strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication.
</p><p>
	Which brings me back to the dragonfly, an animal with a brain that may provide precisely the right balance for certain applications.
</p><p>
	If you have ever encountered a dragonfly, you already know how fast these beautiful creatures can zoom, and you&#39;ve seen their incredible agility in the air. Maybe less obvious from casual observation is their excellent hunting ability: Dragonflies successfully capture up to 95 percent of the prey they pursue, eating hundreds of mosquitoes in a day.
</p><p>
	The physical prowess of the dragonfly has certainly not gone unnoticed. For decades, U.S. agencies have experimented with using dragonfly-inspired designs for surveillance drones. Now it is time to turn our attention to the brain that controls this tiny hunting machine.
</p><p>
<strong>While dragonflies</strong> may not be able to play strategic games like Go, a dragonfly does demonstrate a form of strategy in the way it aims ahead of its prey&#39;s current location to intercept its dinner. This takes calculations performed extremely fast—it typically takes a dragonfly just 50 milliseconds to start turning in response to a prey&#39;s maneuver. It does this while tracking the angle between its head and its body, so that it knows which wings to flap faster to turn ahead of the prey. And it also tracks its own movements, because as the dragonfly turns, the prey will also appear to move.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The model dragonfly reorients in response to the prey&#39;s turning. The smaller black circle is the dragonfly&#39;s head, held at its initial position. The solid black line indicates the direction of the dragonfly&#39;s flight; the dotted blue lines are the plane of the model dragonfly&#39;s eye. The red star is the prey&#39;s position relative to the dragonfly, with the dotted red line indicating the dragonfly&#39;s line of sight.</small>
</p><p>
	So the dragonfly&#39;s brain is performing a remarkable feat, given that the time needed for a single neuron to add up all its inputs—called its membrane time constant—exceeds 10 milliseconds. If you factor in time for the eye to process visual information and for the muscles to produce the force needed to move, there&#39;s really only time for three, maybe four, layers of neurons, in sequence, to add up their inputs and pass on information
</p><p>
	Could I build a neural network that works like the dragonfly interception system? I also wondered about uses for such a neural-inspired interception system. Being at Sandia, I immediately considered defense applications, such as missile defense, imagining missiles of the future with onboard systems designed to rapidly calculate interception trajectories without affecting a missile&#39;s weight or power consumption. But there are civilian applications as well.
</p><p>
	For example, the algorithms that control self-driving cars might be made more efficient, no longer requiring a trunkful of computing equipment. If a dragonfly-inspired system can perform the calculations to plot an interception trajectory, perhaps autonomous drones could use it to 
	<em>avoid</em> collisions. And if a computer could be made the same size as a dragonfly brain (about 6 cubic millimeters), perhaps insect repellent and mosquito netting will one day become a thing of the past, replaced by tiny insect-zapping drones!
</p><p>
<strong>To begin to answer</strong> these questions, I created a simple neural network to stand in for the dragonfly&#39;s nervous system and used it to calculate the turns that a dragonfly makes to capture prey. My three-layer neural network exists as a software simulation. Initially, I worked in Matlab simply because that was the coding environment I was already using. I have since ported the model to Python.
</p><p>
	Because dragonflies have to see their prey to capture it, I started by simulating a simplified version of the dragonfly&#39;s eyes, capturing the minimum detail required for tracking prey. Although dragonflies have two eyes, it&#39;s generally accepted that they do not use stereoscopic depth perception to estimate distance to their prey. In my model, I did not model both eyes. Nor did I try to match the resolution of
	<a href="https://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_insects/DragonflyHead.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>a</u></a><u> dragonfly eye</u>. Instead, the first layer of the neural network includes 441 neurons that represent input from the eyes, each describing a specific region of the visual field—these regions are tiled to form a 21-by-21-neuron array that covers the dragonfly&#39;s field of view. As the dragonfly turns, the location of the prey&#39;s image in the dragonfly&#39;s field of view changes. The dragonfly calculates turns required to align the prey&#39;s image with one (or a few, if the prey is large enough) of these &#34;eye&#34; neurons. A second set of 441 neurons, also in the first layer of the network, tells the dragonfly which eye neurons should be aligned with the prey&#39;s image, that is, where the prey should be within its field of view.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The model dragonfly engages its prey.</small>

	Processing—the calculations that take input describing the movement of an object across the field of vision and turn it into instructions about which direction the dragonfly needs to turn—happens between the first and third layers of my artificial neural network. In this second layer, I used an array of 194,481 (21<sup>4</sup>) neurons, likely much larger than the number of neurons used by a dragonfly for this task. I precalculated the weights of the connections between all the neurons into the network. While these weights could be learned with enough time, there is an advantage to &#34;learning&#34; through evolution and preprogrammed neural network architectures. Once it comes out of its nymph stage as a winged adult (technically referred to as a teneral), the dragonfly does not have a parent to feed it or show it how to hunt. The dragonfly is in a vulnerable state and getting used to a new body—it would be disadvantageous to have to figure out a hunting strategy at the same time. I set the weights of the network to allow the model dragonfly to calculate the correct turns to intercept its prey from incoming visual information. What turns are those? Well, if a dragonfly wants to catch a mosquito that&#39;s crossing its path, it can&#39;t just aim at the mosquito. To borrow from what hockey player Wayne Gretsky once said about pucks, the dragonfly has to aim for where the mosquito is going to be. You might think that following Gretsky&#39;s advice would require a complex algorithm, but in fact the strategy is quite simple: All the dragonfly needs to do is to maintain a constant angle between its line of sight with its lunch and a fixed reference direction.
</p><p>
	Readers who have any experience piloting boats will understand why that is. They know to get worried when the angle between the line of sight to another boat and a reference direction (for example due north) remains constant, because they are on a collision course. Mariners have long avoided steering such a course, known as parallel navigation, to avoid collisions
</p><p>
	Translated to dragonflies, which 
	<em>want</em> to collide with their prey, the prescription is simple: keep the line of sight to your prey constant relative to some external reference. However, this task is not necessarily trivial for a dragonfly as it swoops and turns, collecting its meals. The dragonfly does not have an internal gyroscope (that we know of) that will maintain a constant orientation and provide a reference regardless of how the dragonfly turns. Nor does it have a magnetic compass that will always point north. In my simplified simulation of dragonfly hunting, the dragonfly turns to align the prey&#39;s image with a specific location on its eye, but it needs to calculate what that location should be.
</p><p>
	The third and final layer of my simulated neural network is the motor-command layer. The outputs of the neurons in this layer are high-level instructions for the dragonfly&#39;s muscles, telling the dragonfly in which direction to turn. The dragonfly also uses the output of this layer to predict the effect of its own maneuvers on the location of the prey&#39;s image in its field of view and updates that projected location accordingly. This updating allows the dragonfly to hold the line of sight to its prey steady, relative to the external world, as it approaches.
</p><p>
	It is possible that biological dragonflies have evolved additional tools to help with the calculations needed for this prediction. For example, dragonflies have specialized sensors that measure body rotations during flight as well as head rotations relative to the body—if these sensors are fast enough, the dragonfly could calculate the effect of its movements on the prey&#39;s image directly from the sensor outputs or use one method to cross-check the other. I did not consider this possibility in my simulation.
</p><p>
	To test this three-layer neural network, I simulated a dragonfly and its prey, moving at the same speed through three-dimensional space. As they do so my modeled neural-network brain &#34;sees&#34; the prey, calculates where to point to keep the image of the prey at a constant angle, and sends the appropriate instructions to the muscles. I was able to show that this simple model of a dragonfly&#39;s brain can indeed successfully intercept other bugs, even prey traveling along curved or semi-random trajectories. The simulated dragonfly does not quite achieve the success rate of the biological dragonfly, but it also does not have all the advantages (for example, impressive flying speed) for which dragonflies are known.
</p><p>
<strong>More work is needed </strong>to determine whether this neural network is really incorporating all the secrets of the dragonfly&#39;s brain. Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute&#39;s Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, have developed tiny backpacks for dragonflies that can measure electrical signals from a dragonfly&#39;s nervous system while it is in flight and transmit these data for analysis. The backpacks are small enough not to distract the dragonfly from the hunt. Similarly, neuroscientists can also record signals from individual neurons in the dragonfly&#39;s brain while the insect is held motionless but made to think it&#39;s moving by presenting it with the appropriate visual cues, creating a dragonfly-scale virtual reality.
</p><p>
	Data from these systems allows neuroscientists to validate dragonfly-brain models by comparing their activity with activity patterns of biological neurons in an active dragonfly. While we cannot yet directly measure individual connections between neurons in the dragonfly brain, I and my collaborators will be able to infer whether the dragonfly&#39;s nervous system is making calculations similar to those predicted by my artificial neural network. That will help determine whether connections in the dragonfly brain resemble my precalculated weights in the neural network. We will inevitably find ways in which our model differs from the actual dragonfly brain. Perhaps these differences will provide clues to the shortcuts that the dragonfly brain takes to speed up its calculations.

</p><p>
<strong>Dragonflies could also teach us</strong> how to implement &#34;attention&#34; on a computer. You likely know what it feels like when your brain is at full attention, completely in the zone, focused on one task to the point that other distractions seem to fade away. A dragonfly can likewise focus its attention. Its nervous system turns up the volume on responses to particular, presumably selected, targets, even when other potential prey are visible in the same field of view. It makes sense that once a dragonfly has decided to pursue a particular prey, it should change targets only if it has failed to capture its first choice. (In other words, using parallel navigation to catch a meal is not useful if you are easily distracted.)
</p><p>
	Even if we end up discovering that the dragonfly mechanisms for directing attention are less sophisticated than those people use to focus in the middle of a crowded coffee shop, it&#39;s possible that a simpler but lower-power mechanism will prove advantageous for next-generation algorithms and computer systems by offering efficient ways to discard irrelevant inputs
</p><p>
	The advantages of studying the dragonfly brain do not end with new algorithms; they also can affect systems design. Dragonfly eyes are fast, operating at the equivalent of 200 frames per second: That&#39;s several times the speed of human vision. But their spatial resolution is relatively poor, perhaps just a hundredth of that of the human eye. Understanding how the dragonfly hunts so effectively, despite its limited sensing abilities, can suggest ways of designing more efficient systems. Using the missile-defense problem, the dragonfly example suggests that our antimissile systems with fast optical sensing could require less spatial resolution to hit a target.
</p><p>
<strong>The dragonfly isn&#39;t the only insect</strong> that could inform neural-inspired computer design today. Monarch butterflies migrate incredibly long distances, using some innate instinct to begin their journeys at the appropriate time of year and to head in the right direction. We know that monarchs rely on the position of the sun, but navigating by the sun requires keeping track of the time of day. If you are a butterfly heading south, you would want the sun on your left in the morning but on your right in the afternoon. So, to set its course, the butterfly brain must therefore read its own circadian rhythm and combine that information with what it is observing.
</p><p>
	Other insects, like the Sahara desert ant, must forage for relatively long distances. Once a source of sustenance is found, this ant does not simply retrace its steps back to the nest, likely a circuitous path. Instead it calculates a direct route back. Because the location of an ant&#39;s food source changes from day to day, it must be able to remember the path it took on its foraging journey, combining visual information with some internal measure of distance traveled, and then
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Desert-Navigator-Journey-R%C3%BCdiger-Wehner/dp/0674045882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>calculate its return route</u></a> from those memories.
</p><p>
	While nobody knows what neural circuits in the desert ant perform this task, researchers at the Janelia Research Campus have identified neural circuits that allow the fruit fly to
	<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14446" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>self-orient using visual landmarks</u></a>. The desert ant and monarch butterfly likely use similar mechanisms. Such neural circuits might one day prove useful in, say, low-power drones.
</p><p>
	And what if the efficiency of insect-inspired computation is such that millions of instances of these specialized components can be run in parallel to support more powerful data processing or machine learning? Could the next AlphaZero incorporate millions of antlike foraging architectures to refine its game playing? Perhaps insects will inspire a new generation of computers that look very different from what we have today. A small army of dragonfly-interception-like algorithms could be used to control moving pieces of an amusement park ride, ensuring that individual cars do not collide (much like pilots steering their boats) even in the midst of a complicated but thrilling dance.
</p><p>
	No one knows what the next generation of computers will look like, whether they will be part-cyborg companions or centralized resources much like Isaac Asimov&#39;s Multivac. Likewise, no one can tell what the best path to developing these platforms will entail. While researchers developed early neural networks drawing inspiration from the human brain, today&#39;s artificial neural networks often rely on decidedly unbrainlike calculations. Studying the calculations of individual neurons in biological neural circuits—currently only directly possible in nonhuman systems—may have more to teach us. Insects, apparently simple but often astonishing in what they can do, have much to contribute to the development of next-generation computers, especially as neuroscience research continues to drive toward a deeper understanding of how biological neural circuits work.
</p><p>
	So next time you see an insect doing something clever, imagine the impact on your everyday life if you could have the brilliant efficiency of a small army of tiny dragonfly, butterfly, or ant brains at your disposal. Maybe computers of the future will give new meaning to the term &#34;hive mind,&#34; with swarms of highly specialized but extremely efficient minuscule processors, able to be reconfigured and deployed depending on the task at hand. With the advances being made in neuroscience today, this seeming fantasy may be closer to reality than you think.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One night nearly 2,500 years ago, the people of Helike, a city in the northern Peloponnese, were in their homes. Perhaps they were winding down with a glass of watered wine or already sleeping after spending the day about their business in the bustling town. Some had been busy at the market, selling or buying the produce from the local farms or purchasing goods from further afield. Some might have visited the famous Temple of Poseidon, as worshippers or priests of the cult, or trained in the gymnasium. Others were engaged in usual city business, the day-to-day civic and political life of Helike. This night, though, would be their last.</p>
<p>As they slept, a terrible earthquake struck the region, toppling buildings and killing the inhabitants. Then, in a second calamity, the city was swallowed up by a giant wave. The inhabitants disappeared. A recovery party of <span>2,000 men</span> sent from neighbouring cities found no bodies. The nearby village of Bura was destroyed too.</p>
<p>The story of the destruction of classical Helike in <span>373 BCE</span> rippled out through the Greek lands. When it was recent history, Aristotle (384-<span>322 BCE)</span> wrote of it in his <em>Meterologica</em>, a book not only about the atmosphere and weather, as we would expect, but also more generally about what we could term Earth processes, including earthquakes and tsunamis. Helike was remembered and written about for centuries by Greek and Roman authors. But as the centuries turned and the coastline shifted, the location of the once-great city was forgotten. The search for this city has captivated modern archaeologists for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>Exploring what happened at Helike involves looking at different types of evidence, including ancient texts, archaeological evidence and geological study. This search enables us to learn not only about this fatal disaster, bringing us closer to the people of the past, but it can also help reveal the way in which the ancient Greeks and Romans thought about how their world worked.</p>
<p>Greece is a common victim of earthquakes and tsunamis; it is the most seismically <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6815-7_17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active</a> part of Europe. In the past <span>10 years,</span> there have been eight earthquakes of <span>magnitude 6+.</span> The Athens earthquake of 1999 killed <span>143 people</span> <span>(magnitude 6)</span> and the 1953 Kefalonia earthquake killed 476 <span>(magnitude 7.2).</span> Since 1950, <span>22 earthquakes</span> in Greece have also generated tsunamis. On <span>30 October</span> 2020, there was a <span>magnitude 7</span> earthquake and tsunamis struck the island of Samos and the Turkish coast. At Samos, the tsunami ran up onto the land to a height of <span>1.8 metres.</span> In 1956, a tsunami hit the island of Amorgos, with a run-up height of up to <span>25 metres.</span></p>
<p>In the <span>20th century,</span> our understanding of these phenomena is founded in a sure scientific basis through a century of geological work. Alfred Wegener’s theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912, led eventually to the development of the idea of plate tectonics, that the Earth’s surface was in motion, and then to its confirmation through observation and mapping of the ocean floors after the Second World War, especially the publication of the Tharp-Heezen map of the Atlantic in 1977. We know that earthquakes are caused by slipping and thrusting at faults, areas where the Earth’s tectonic plates meet. When this happens underwater, the motion causes the displacement of water, which results in tsunamis. Landslide, either above or underwater, is another mechanism that creates tsunamis and is a common result of earthquakes. The Amorgos tsunami was caused both by the displacement of the sea floor and by undersea landslides.</p>
<p>Our perception of natural catastrophes is nowadays informed by science, the news, by documentaries, novels and the ever-popular genre of disaster movies, all of which provide us with ideas about, and images of, disaster. The ancient Greeks and Romans had their own traditions about disasters from the sea, which were passed down through the generations.</p>
<p><span>P</span>erhaps the first description of a tsunami comes from Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>, written down in <span><em>c</em></span><span>700 BCE.</span> Homer tells us that the Greeks had built a mighty wall to protect their ships, which were pulled up onto the beach. After <span>10 years</span> of siege, the Trojan hero Hector was killed and Troy sacked. The victorious Greeks boarded their ships and left. Then Zeus, Apollo and Poseidon decided to erase all traces of the Greek wall – Apollo turned the rivers against it, Zeus brought constant rain, and Poseidon ‘the Shaker of Earth, bearing his trident in his hands, was himself the leader, and swept forth upon the waves all the foundations of beams and stones, that the Achaeans had laid with toil, and made all smooth along the strong stream of the Hellespont, and again covered the great beach with sand, when he had swept away the wall’. What prompted this divine cleansing of the landscape? According to the story, when the Greeks had built the wall, they had failed to make the proper sacrifices to the gods – and, while the wall lasted out the war intact, the gods eventually destroyed it.</p>
<p>Another ancient Greek myth, written down and preserved for us in a collection of stories called the <em>Library of Greek Mythology</em>, ascribed to the <span>2nd-century BCE</span> scholar Apollodorus, also concerns a disaster from the sea. In the story of Perseus and Andromeda, Perseus, ‘arriving in Ethiopia, which was ruled by Cepheus … found the king’s daughter Andromeda exposed as prey to a sea monster; for Cassiopeia, the wife of Cepheus, had claimed to rival the Nereids in beauty … The Nereids were enraged by this, and Poseidon, who shared their anger, sent a sea-flood and a monster against the land …’ The story of Perseus and Andromeda was an ancient and popular one; the rescue is depicted on a painted Corinthian pot of the <span>6th century BCE</span> and even on a Pompeian fresco centuries later.</p>
<p>These stories were not mere fantasy. The details have their origins in the observation of real natural processes – earthquakes and floods, as well as coastal inundation caused by waves or tsunamis. Even heroes, giants and monsters had at least some of their roots in the discovery, observation and display of unusual ancient animal bones, which could end up stored in temples. Such natural phenomena had to be accommodated and understood by people individually and within their shared culture and history. One way in which they could be viewed was through a religious lens.</p>
<p>The philosopher Democritus <span>(</span><span><em>c</em></span><span>420 BCE)</span> suggested, according to Sextus Empiricus, that gods had been created in ancient times because ‘men were frightened of celestial phenomena such as thunder and lightning … and imagined that the gods were responsible for these things’ – and for the Greeks generally ‘the whole … conception of the world was influenced by religious ideas’. So it is not surprising that earthquakes, floods and rogue waves were explained by divine action and references to the relationships between gods and mortals. The connection between earthquakes and the sea is made explicitly through the sea god Poseidon. Poseidon was worshipped from at least the Late Bronze Age (<em>c</em>1600-<span>1200 BCE)</span> until the later days of the Roman Empire – a span of more than <span>1,500 years.</span></p>
<p>The city was submerged so deeply that only the treetops in the sacred grove of Poseidon were visible</p>
<p>Reports on these natural phenomena are not restricted to myth. They are also found in the works of the earliest classical historians. Herodotus, writing in the later <span>5th century BCE,</span> is remembered as the historian of the wars between the Greeks and Persians, but his work includes fascinating details of the habits and traditions of various peoples, and speculations on the natural world, including the source of the Nile. Herodotus tells us that after the Greek victories in <span>479 BCE,</span> at the battles of Plataea and Mycale, the Persian general Artabazus escorted king Xerxes back through northern Greece to the Hellespont and across into Anatolia. The people of Potidaea, a city on the north coast of the Aegean, revolted against the Persians, and Artabazus decided to settle the matter and moved against them, putting the city under siege. After three months, Herodotus tells us, something unusual happened:</p>
<blockquote>there was a great ebb-tide in the sea which lasted for a long while, and when the foreigners saw that the sea was turned to a marsh, they prepared to pass over it into Pallene. When they had made their way over two-fifths of it, however, and three yet remained to cross before they could be in Pallene, there came a great flood-tide, higher, as the people of the place say, than any one of the many that had been before. Some of them who did not know how to swim were drowned, and those who knew were slain by the Potidaeans, who came among them in boats. The Potidaeans say that the cause of the high sea and flood and the Persian disaster lay in the fact that those same Persians who now perished in the sea had profaned the temple and the image of Poseidon which was in the suburb of the city. I think that in saying that this was the cause they are correct.</blockquote>
<p>This is a description of a tsunami: the sea retreated, exposing the land, and then flooded back in much higher than usual, drowning those exposed. In this case, Potidaea was saved by the sea from destruction by a human enemy, rather than destroyed in a disaster. The people of the city explained the event in terms of divine retribution for a sacrilegious act by the Persians, an explanation that Herodotus agreed with. Perhaps the story of the delivery of Potidaea by a great wave had become a popular one among Greeks in the period after the Persian wars. Recently, a team of researchers studying the landscape near ancient Potidaea have <a href="https://www.schweizerbart.de/papers/zfg_suppl/detail/62/91797/Event_deposits_in_the_Eastern_Thermaikos_Gulf_and_?af=crossref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> plausible evidence of the tsunami in core samples taken from the region, which contain pottery and marine shells that could have been carried inland by the wave.</p>
<p>At the end of the <span>5th century,</span> the Athenian historian Thucydides wrote of the Peloponnesian war, which he participated in as a general. In book three of his history, he tells us of a joint Peloponnesian army that set out to invade Attica in <span>426 BCE,</span> but which retreated because of a spate of earthquakes. Years before, in <span>464 BCE,</span> the Spartan slave class, the Helots, had seized the moment to rebel when a powerful earthquake struck Sparta. This time, the earthquakes were accompanied by tsunamis in at least two places in Greece, which Thucydides described:</p>
<blockquote>About the same time that these earthquakes were so common, the sea at Orobiae, in Euboea, retiring from the then line of coast, returned in a huge wave and invaded a great part of the town, and retreated leaving some of it still under water; so that what was once land is now sea; such of the inhabitants perishing as could not run up to the higher ground in time. A similar inundation also occurred at Atalanta, the island off the Opuntian-Locrian coast, carrying away part of the Athenian fort and wrecking one of two ships which were drawn up on the beach.</blockquote>
<p>Then, some <span>50 years</span> after Orobiae and Atalanta, Helike was destroyed. Helike was an old and important city, situated in a fertile delta on the north coast of the Peloponnese between the Selinus and Cerynites rivers on the southern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, around <span>150 km</span> west of Athens. It was the leading city in the Achaean League, a confederation of city-states, and was for centuries a major centre for the worship of Poseidon – Homer mentions ‘the offerings many and gracious’ brought to the ‘Earth-shaker’ at Helike, while archaeologists have <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41721708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> traces of a sanctuary dating back to <span><em>c</em></span><span>700 BCE.</span> The only contemporary source surviving is Aristotle, who says very little except that there was an earthquake and a wave. The next source we have is another historian, Polybius (<em>c</em>200-<span>118 BCE),</span> who noted that Helike had been ‘engulfed by the sea’. But later sources tell the story in more detail.</p>
<p>The historian Diodorus Siculus (<em>c</em>80-<span>20 BCE)</span> described how an earthquake struck the Peloponnese at night and killed many people, especially at Helike and Bura. The survivors faced a still greater danger, when ‘the sea rose to a vast height, and a wave towering even higher washed away and drowned all the inhabitants and their native lands as well’. He emphasised the enormous scale of these twin natural disasters, writing that ‘never in the earlier periods had such disasters befallen Greek cities, nor had entire cities along with their inhabitants disappeared as a result of some divine force wreaking destruction and ruin upon mankind’. This was three centuries before his own time.</p>
<p>The Greek geographer Strabo <span>(</span><span><em>c</em></span><span>64 BCE</span>-<span><em>c</em></span><span>23 CE)</span> preserved some snippets from two earlier sources on the disaster. He cited the contemporary Heracleides as saying that ‘the submersion took place by night in his time, and, although the city was <span>12 stadia</span> distant from the sea, this whole district together with the city was hidden from sight.’ It was Heracleides who added that the <span>2,000 men</span> sent by the other Achaeans to help were unable to recover any bodies from Helike. And Eratosthenes, he wrote, described how ‘he himself saw the place, and that the ferrymen say that there was a bronze Poseidon in the strait, standing erect, holding a hippo-campus [a mythical creature, half-horse and half-fish] in his hand, which was perilous for those who fished with nets.’</p>
<p>In the <span>2nd century CE,</span> the travel writer Pausanias also told the story of Helike. According to him too, an earthquake and a giant wave swallowed up the city, its buildings and inhabitants. The city was submerged so deeply that only the treetops in the sacred grove of Poseidon were visible. He reported that in his time nothing remained to be seen of the city on land, but that some remains were still visible underwater. Later, Aelian (<em>c</em>175-<span>235 CE)</span> added a further detail, that five days before the earthquake ‘all the mice and martens and snakes and centipedes and beetles and every other creature of that kind in the town left in a body by the road that leads to Cerynea’. The people of Helike were amazed, but did not know why the animals left (Aelian believed that mice and martens would flee before the collapse of a building). He also tells us that <span>10 Spartan</span> ships anchored at Helike were destroyed.</p>
<p><span>T</span>he sources, from the contemporary Aristotle and Heracleides to the much later Pausanias and Aelian, agree that Helike was struck by both a devastating earthquake in which many died, and that the city was ruined and submerged. The city remained partly visible underwater for some centuries, but eventually vanished. Since the general location of Helike was never lost, it has seemed obvious that it lay somewhere under the sea between the mouths of the Selinus and Cerynites rivers. In the 1950s, the Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos began a search for the city, both on land, scanning aerial photographs, talking to locals about the landscape, and setting up a project to sonar-scan the seabed where Helike was thought to be. The lure of finding an ‘intact’ classical city, a time-capsule potentially still containing many of its treasures – possibly even the great statue of Poseidon – was strong. Despite a valiant attempt, Marinatos was unsuccessful. But he left the suggestion in his 1960 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41663785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in <em>Archaeology</em> that the city might actually turn out to be buried under the land rather than the sea. In 1861, a coin minted in Helike had been found in the area, which offered possible support to this theory.</p>
<p>In 1988, the members of a new Helike Project, having found nothing under the sea, began to drill boreholes on shore in the plain between the Selinus and Cerynites. Between 1991 and 2002, they drilled 99 to an average depth of <span>16 metres.</span> At nine locations, they followed up with excavation. This time, the team found material of the classical period – pottery, walls, roof tiles and coins. They found traces of marine microfauna and a gravelly soil that could have been laid down by a giant wave. Helike had been found – or at least some tiny parts of it.</p>
<p>One local told about a vineyard that was originally next to the sea but only a few years later was <span>90 metres</span> inland</p>
<p>But the team leaders Dora Katsonopoulou and Steven Soter were still not certain that their evidence was sufficient to prove that an earthquake and tsunami really did destroy the city. In a 2011 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gea.20366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in the international journal <em>Geoarchaeology</em>, they stated: ‘while the historical evidence for the earthquake and tsunami in <span>373 BCE</span> is strong, evidence based on stratigraphy and archaeological excavation is merely suggestive’.</p>
<p>The region where Helike was situated is prone to landscape change of various kinds. The Helike fault separates mountains on one geological block to the south from the delta in the north on another. Earthquakes result in the rising of the mountains and the subsidence of the delta. One local told Marinatos about a vineyard that was originally next to the sea but only a few years later was <span>90 metres</span> inland. It is possible that the southern part of the block was being forced down and the northern part, the coastline, was being forced up. At the same time, the rivers Selinus and Cerynites have occasionally changed their courses – sometimes because of uplift, causing flooding, and they are also constantly laying down sediment. Earthquakes can also cause soil liquefaction, in which areas of land in the region have been known to disappear. It is possible that a combination of earthquakes and tsunami, uplift and subsidence, and soil liquefaction ruined and then ‘swallowed up’ the city. Subsequent changes to the landscape have since buried it further. However, secure evidence on the ground for a great tsunami still <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gea.21540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains</a> elusive.</p>
<p>An alternative theory was proposed in 2020 in an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959683620950389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in <em>The Holocene</em> by Ioannis Koukouvelas of the University of Patras and colleagues, including Katsonopoulou. They suggest that, rather than being submerged by a wave from the sea, Helike might have been flooded from the landward side. This might sound bizarre at first, but the idea is based on real examples of rain and flood events in the region. In the early <span>20th century,</span> for example, a natural dam had formed on the Krathis river, creating a lake <span>3 km</span> long. Then, in January 1914, the dam burst, causing a metre-deep flood some <span>13 km</span> in length. Studying the topography and hydrology of the region, and the evidence for past landslides, they propose that the <span>373 BCE</span> earthquake caused dams to form in the Katourlas Valley and the Selinus River, which then gave way in flood events. Perhaps the killer wave was not a tsunami after all. Could contemporaries or later sources have misunderstood what happened? Was the story elaborated and then passed on? Or have we misunderstood something?</p>
<p><span>P</span>lato’s philosophical works the <em>Timaeus</em> and <em>Critias</em> could help. These are the dialogues that recount the <a href="https://aeon.co/videos/not-a-lost-kingdom-but-a-parable-how-to-read-athens-in-platos-story-of-atlantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantis</a> myth, which is part-utopian fantasy and part-political allegory. The story of the fictional Atlanteans’ fall from grace was intended as a lesson: the Athenians should remember their past virtue and successes and beware of becoming too arrogant and bellicose. Plato wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>There was an island … larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travellers could … reach the other islands and from them the whole opposite continent … on this island of Atlantis had arisen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island and many other islands as well and parts of the continent … At a later time there was earthquakes and floods of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night … the island of Atlantis was … swallowed up by the sea and vanished.</blockquote>
<p>In his <em>Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus</em> (1928), the classicist Alfred Taylor thought that the description of the destruction of Atlantis was ‘pretty certainly suggested to Plato by the occurrence of the same thing on a lesser scale in his lifetime. The tidal wave which destroyed the Achaean cities of Helike and Bura in <span>373 BCE</span> … accompanied by a violent earthquake’. Later both Phyllis Forsyth in her <em>Atlantis: The Making of Myth</em> (1980) and Richard Ellis in his <em>Imagining Atlantis</em> (1999) also raised Helike as a possible source of inspiration for Plato, though Forsyth thought that a link to the prehistoric Thera eruption and Minoan Crete might be part of the story too.</p>
<p>But what is often left out when the <em>Timaeus</em> is quoted is that it also says the virtuous Athenian soldiers, who had just defeated the imperialistic Atlanteans, were ‘swallowed up by the earth’ at the same time as the island sank, which seems harder to explain. This fate could be related to the idea that a good death is a divine reward. It is also possible that Plato’s combination of a city and soldiers being swallowed up both by sea and earth recalls the story of Helike, though we should expect poetic licence and not a witness statement. The name Atlantis could have been inspired by the island of Atalanta, which, as mentioned above, was also struck by a great wave. These contemporary events are a much more likely inspiration for Plato than any distant memory of the eruption of the Thera volcano and its possible effects on Late Bronze Age Crete more than a millennium earlier.</p>
<p>‘The disaster was occasioned by the anger of the gods at those who had committed sacrilege’</p>
<p>The Atlanteans were punished for their desire to conquer foreign lands and enslave people excessively, and were defeated by the virtuous Athenians. A similar theme of divine retribution – or justice – permeates the ancient explanations for earthquakes and tsunamis. As mentioned, the Potidaeans and Herodotus thought Poseidon responsible for the deaths of the sacrilegious Persians. Poseidon had caused the tsunami in judgment for Persian actions. We should not dismiss Herodotus or the Potidaeans as particularly credulous, since even today many people understand, explain and make sense of disasters <a href="https://asianethnology.org/downloads/ae/pdf/AE%2075-1%20Feener%20and%20Daly%20J.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through</a> the lens of religion, including many victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.</p>
<p>Several sources record the idea that Helike’s citizens brought about their own destruction when they prevented a group of allied Greeks from Ionia from worshipping Poseidon at their sanctuary. Pausanias explained how ‘the wrath of Poseidon visited them without delay’. Two proofs that Poseidon was responsible, Diodorus noted, were that ‘first, it is distinctly conceived that authority over earthquakes and floods belongs to this god, and also it is the ancient belief that the Peloponnese was a habitation of Poseidon’. Such attributions of cause made sense in the general worldview of the time.</p>
<p>Strabo combined the idea of divine intervention with what we would see as a more scientific explanation, that the sea was raised up by an earthquake. Thucydides had given a similar reason for the great waves of <span>426 BCE,</span> perhaps in a conscious contrast to Herodotus. He stated that:</p>
<blockquote>The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen.</blockquote>
<p>By his time, some three centuries after the event, Diodorus tells us that the destructions of Helike and Bura had ‘been the subject of much discussion’ and that:</p>
<blockquote>Natural scientists make it their endeavour to attribute responsibility in such cases not to divine providence, but to certain natural circumstances determined by necessary causes, whereas those who are disposed to venerate the divine power assign certain plausible reasons for the occurrence, alleging that the disaster was occasioned by the anger of the gods at those who had committed sacrilege.</blockquote>
<p><span>G</span>iven the frequency of earthquakes in Greece, it is hardly surprising that they had attracted the attention of thinkers stretching back to the beginnings of the Greek philosophical tradition – and in a sense they can be understood as part of the development of this more ‘scientific’ approach to the world. The Roman poet Ovid <span>(43 BCE</span>-<span>17 CE)</span> incorporated Pythagoras’ (<em>c</em>570-<span>495 BCE)</span> theories of change into his poem the <em>Metamorphoses –</em> putting a long speech into his mouth; everything changes, he says:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve seen the ocean turn to dry land; and sea shells often lie far from the shore; and on a mountain top is found a rusty anchor centuries old … In deep quakings of the earth rivers burst out or, drying, sink from sight [or shift to flow a different way] … The sea encompassed once Antissa and Tyre and gleaming Pharos: none are islands now. Leucas, the early settlers used to tell, was once a promontory; now the waves surround it. Zancle too, they say, was joined to Italy until the ocean tore their boundary apart and straits between severed the land. And should you ask for Buris and Helice, once cities of Achaea, they lie beneath the waves; sailors still show the tilted towns and sunken battlements.</blockquote>
<p>Aristotle’s section in the <em>Meteorologica</em> on earthquakes and their cause begins by summarising the views of three men, Anaximenes (<em>c</em>586-<span>528 BCE),</span> Anaxagoras (<em>c</em>500-<span>428 BCE),</span> and Democritus. Anaximenes thought that earthquakes happened during droughts or heavy rains, and associated them with the drying or wetting of the earth. Anaxagoras suggested that earthquakes happened when air tried to rise from below the earth but was prevented by moisture – rain-soaked ground. Democritus, on the other hand, thought the earth filled with water not air and argued that the escape of excess rain from underground caused earthquakes, as did the influx of water when a space dried out.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, wind was the underlying cause of the destruction of Helike</p>
<p>Aristotle disagreed with all of these theories, suggesting that Anaximenes’ ideas did not fit with what was observable about where and when earthquakes happened. Aristotle ventured his own explanation for earthquakes and tsunamis: wind. He drew on several strands of observational evidence, for example the locations of the most violent earthquakes, the existence of subterranean noises and the swelling up and bursting of land and eruption of winds to prove his theory. Tsunamis, he argued, were caused by:</p>
<blockquote>an opposition of winds … when the wind which is causing the earthquake is unable quite to drive out the sea which is being driven in by another wind, but pushes it back and piles it together till a large mass has collected. Then, if the first wind gives way the whole mass is driven in by the opposing wind and breaks on land and causes a flood.</blockquote>
<p>For Aristotle, wind was the underlying cause of the destruction of Helike, and this conclusion was based on his observation and knowledge of previous events and phenomena. Earthquakes and tsunamis could be seen as evidence of natural processes and not caused (at least directly) by gods. His explanation was followed by the Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius (<em>c</em>100-<span>50 BCE)</span> in his <em>The Nature of Things.</em></p>
<p>Diodorus and Strabo hint at a lively interest among people of antiquity in understanding earthquakes and tsunamis, and we could add other sources to our discussion, such as Pliny the Elder and Seneca, in Roman imperial times. Some scholars even composed catalogues of earthquakes in ancient Greece, such as the one by Demetrius of Callatis <span>(3rd century BCE),</span> mentioned by Strabo. Sadly, these have not survived, but they would have been important repositories of earthquake observations and information in ancient times. Besides speculating on their causes, we know also that ancient Greeks and Romans sometimes dreamed of earthquakes and tsunamis. The dream-interpreter Artemidorus <span>(</span><span><em>c</em></span><span>200 CE)</span> tells us that the rocking of the earth signified the rocking of a person’s life: the more severe the trembling, the worse the diagnosis, although for debtors or émigrés they could be positive signs of release from difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>The ancient world was not so different from today in that its people experienced and sought to understand natural disasters brought on by earthquakes and tsunamis. They did so in ways that were influenced by their milieu – by their traditions and education, and by their conversation and curiosity. These natural disasters were part of the story of the developments of religion, cultural norms and social behaviour, and also of the development of what we see as rational or scientific thinking.</p>
<p>Helike and Bura stand out in the sources because of the apparent severity of their destruction. However, the archaeological research carried out in the Helike region shows that it was not completely abandoned in <span>373 BCE.</span> There are later destruction layers and coins minted shortly after <span>373 BCE,</span> the remains of a Hellenistic temple, as well as Roman remains, including a major road. It could be, as some of Helike’s researchers think, that the calamity was not as great as the texts suggest and that people continued to live in the fertile delta. Perhaps the destruction of the two towns became a popular story and a literary trope symbolic of a terrible natural disaster, much as Pompeii is for us today. Perhaps it even became something like an exemplar or case study for the educated to think about particular Earth processes, part of an intellectual exercise, like explaining the source of the Nile.</p>
<p>What exactly happened to ancient Helike and Bura is not clear, despite more than 50 years of scrutiny by archaeologists and geologists. But we can be sure that there was a catastrophe of some kind that destroyed the city and killed many inhabitants, which was sufficiently powerful to make Helike a byword for disaster; we know enough about the region to believe that it is plausible. Contemporary calamities such as the Indian Ocean tsunami can show us the real human experience – the terror, the cost in lives, and the aftermath – of these ancient disasters, as well as pointing to the way people respond to such events, and even how they might eventually recover from them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stories of how my research papers were published</title>

<h4>By <a href="https://jeffhuang.com">Jeff Huang</a>, updated 2021-08-01</h4>

<p>
	The start of my sabbatical has given me a moment to reflect on my publications. But <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/CurriculumVitae.pdf">my CV</a> only shows a list of neatly cataloged papers: title, authors, conference. Each one appearing no different from another. But how each paper ended up published is its own story, a story about people and opportunity.
</p>
<p>
	Using notes from <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/">my research journal</a> and conference records, I reassembled the &#34;Behind the scenes&#34; story for each of my full research papers: 15 papers as a student, and 15 papers after becoming a professor (excluding papers not led by my research group, as I feel it&#39;s not my place to tell those stories). This is as much a <a href="#introspection">reflective exercise for myself</a> than it is for an audience.
</p>
<p>
	If you read this page in its entirety, it will take about 30 minutes. But you can skip the ones you find boring, and it should still make sense. The first half are my <a href="#student_papers">student stories</a>, and the second half are my <a href="#professor_papers">professor stories</a>, so you can even just read the half that&#39;s more interesting to you. This would probably be more enticing as a series of Tweets or a Substack newsletter, but I&#39;d rather post it all at once.
</p>
<p>
	I&#39;d love to read the backstories of other peoples&#39; publications too. So if you feel comfortable sharing, post yours and email me if you want it linked at the bottom of this page so we can start a collection. Anyways, here goes.
</p>
<hr id="student_papers"/>
<h3>Part 1: Papers as a student author</h3>
<hr/>

<ol><li>
I first stumbled upon research in September 2003 while I was a second-year undergraduate student. My inbox popped up the message, <em>&#34;call me or track me down in class, &#39;cause a full explanation will take a lot of typing. -Bo&#34;</em>.</li><hr/><li>
My next paper was sadly my first and only full paper with my original advisor, Efthi, before he passed. I don&#39;t remember coming up with this idea to study query reformulations, so it must have been he who led me to it. It was intended to be something easy but original—a starter project analyzing the sequences in existing data released by AOL.</li><hr/><li>
I met Ryen from Microsoft Research when he was a visiting speaker in Efthi&#39;s class, and he must have found my internship application that mentioned my paper about query reformulations. Well it turned out he was interested in search trails, which are essentially a series of reformulations, so I was able to continue along that line of work.</li><hr/><li>
This related paper came out of the same summer internship with Ryen. I was lucky to be included in the author list because I had a small role and never even met the first author. Besides my initial work over the summer that was moreso for the paper above this, I contributed probably only a paragraph of writing. After reading this paper, I felt like it was better than the one I had contributed more, but it has received fewer than half the citations.
</li><hr/><li>
I met a brilliant intern during that same summer, Anna, who was doing her <em>first of two</em> Math PhDs at that time and often seemed idle. She explained, &#34;the people who are always busy never seem to get much done.&#34; So sensing her free time, I asked her to help solve a made-up hypothetical problem that simplified assumptions from the information retrieval community.</li><hr/><li>
After the summer, I was looking for new ideas to pursue outside my usual information retrieval topics. A friend in the Ph.D. program Gifford came to me with the suggestion that watching people playing video games was an overlooked phenomenon. But no one was paying attention. At that time, you could really only watch low-resolution videos of Korean players with amateur commentary dubbed in English.</li><hr/><li>
This became the most important paper during my Ph.D., and it was minutes from not happening. The idea was one of three that I tossed around during my interview to be a Research Intern at Bing. But to apply this idea to the search engine required a complex series of software integration steps that I was not too familiar with; yet it had to be committed by deadlines that occurred every two weeks.</li><hr/><li>
Back at school, and with momentum from our previous paper about gaming, Gifford and I looked at one of his rejected papers about Texas Hold&#39;em, and expanded it with data from another game, Halo 2. We repeated our formula of qualitative analysis, and submitted to CSCW. It received borderline ratings from our reviewers, but CSCW was experimenting with a &#34;revise and resubmit&#34; process that we were lucky to go through.
</li><hr/><li>
At this point, one of my friends from the summer internship, Abdi, felt like I had &#34;the magic touch&#34; so I offered to help out with a rejected internship paper. I only helped brainstorm and edit, but it did end up getting accepted without much fanfare. While this one worked out, a year later I tried to rescue another paper with him, but it only ended up in the bin. Same effort, opposite outcomes.
</li><hr/><li>
Now it was the end of my third year, and I felt guilty that I only had one dissertation chapter ready. I had co-founded a startup as part of Techstars Seattle while teaching a class in the evening, so those things had occupied all of my time. Our startup eventually ran out of money and my co-founders left for other opportunities, so in the summer I returned to Microsoft Research for my third internship. Again I joined a different group, this one managed by Sue who a year later became my Ph.D. advisor.</li><hr/><li>
A Bing employee, Georg, had collected a nice dataset from a study for one purpose, but it seemed like it could be used to study something closer to what I had done before. He graciously lent me the data, and I did enough analysis to produce this paper. However, one reviewer felt that the descriptive results were not that novel (just a bigger study), nor were the predictive analysis that successful, summarizing &#34;with their paper they now try to add more to this field, but I don&#39;t see the important contribution that would justify the publication at CHI.&#34; The opinions were ultimately divided.</li><hr/><li>
The third paper of that summer was an easier analysis with a novel idea—that sophisticated use of browser tabs was a central part to finding information. I recruited another student from my university, Tom, who happened to be there interning the same summer. The metareviewer remarked quite correctly, &#34;The paper is not rocket science but [...] to my knowledge has not really been looked at, at least not at this large scale.&#34;</li><hr/><li>
As a bonus for the summer, Georg was writing his own paper, and I had a minor contribution that he deemed enough for a co-authorship. It got a decent number of citations and filled a nice gap in the research field, as well as in my dissertation. So it became a lucky 4-paper summer. I was exhausted by the end of it and took a nice long break.
</li><hr/><li>
Besides the two papers with Gifford about gaming, I wasn&#39;t doing any research during the school year, as all my other papers were from internships. Without an advisor, I served as a teaching assistant every quarter (sometimes for two or even three classes at once), and got a bit distracted with some other activities.</li><hr/><li>
I wasn&#39;t originally planning to do another research internship at Microsoft in my last summer, but Tom and Nachi reached out to me about an opportunity I couldn&#39;t say no to—a summer to study gaming with large-scale Xbox data. So in my last internship, I joined their gaming research initiative. It was a collaboration between Microsoft Research and folks from Xbox, and along the way I learned a few techniques for time-series analysis.</li>
<hr id="professor_papers"/>
<h3>Part 2: Papers as a faculty author</h3>
<hr/><li>
Up to this point, I was feeling comfortable leading a paper from start to finish, but the job changed when I became faculty. While I could come up with the idea and advise the process, the initial drafts would be written by students.</li><hr/><li>
While teaching my graduate seminar, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the students so I started assigning projects that students could recycle into research. This became the first of a few papers that were born from class projects in my HCI seminars. Each student worked on their own mini-study, and we combined it into a meta analysis, which is a formula that worked for a couple more papers in later years as well.</li><hr/><li>
I led my first Ph.D. student Alexandra in a few unfruitful directions trying to continue ideas from my Ph.D. that ended up with two unpublished papers worth of work (so I&#39;m grateful for her patience). But one day while laying in bed I realized we could flip the story from estimating attention with the cursor, to using the webcam while the cursor auto-calibrates the webcam model during regular web browsing. We could deploy this as a library, basically shipping a product.</li><hr/><li>
I admitted a second student, Nedi, to our Ph.D. program who had prior work on sleep diary research during her undergrad. My brainstorming notes in the months before she arrived was, &#34;we will use data-driven techniques across a large populations sleep data to make (personalized) prescriptive sleep recommendations&#34;. By coincidence, I met some new collaborators who had clinical research expertise for this, so Nedi and her team of research assistants set out with these collaborators to develop the software and the study.</li><hr/><li>
This paper followed from Alexandra&#39;s previous one, so was a bit more straightforward as a follow-on application to our previous work. Reviewers like it, and it received an honorable mention. I wish I had more to say, but it was one of the rare times where the idea was universally agreeable and the results were as expected. Later I learned that during my tenure application, an external letter writer remarked that I didn&#39;t have many follow-up papers (sequels) at that time, in fact just this one.
</li><hr/><li>
Work on this paper started mid-2015, led by Shaun, a Masters student who became a Ph.D. student later. It was a fairly complex product so it took the team substantial time to build it out, and the paper was not published until 2 years later. What&#39;s nice is the paper had some broad impacts: two of the undergraduate students working on it are in Ph.D. programs now, and there are still active users of the online web application 6 years since the work started.</li><hr/><li>
We followed a similar formula as before, having students in the HCI seminar run mini-studies, which became a meta study for this paper. But things were not so easy this time around, as the first version of the paper with one cohort struggled to reveal enough compelling findings. So we had to develop a new procedure for students in the seminar in another year, and combined the results from both cohorts for the submission.</li><hr/><li>
This paper was an exhausting amount of work for Alexandra, collecting a high-quality dataset with the hopes to release it as a contribution. The setup, lengthy procedure, and large number of participants were meant to provide stronger validity for the general topic of eye tracking during interactions.</li><hr/><li>
My most recent Ph.D. admit, Jing, came with a unique design and technical background, so started working on an ambitious virtual reality project. However, that idea had trouble producing consistent results in practice, but I noted in my research journal on October 2016 that the &#34;motion movement physical device that Jing built that can be used for replay too&#34;. So we pivoted to building the product for a different use case which became this paper.</li><hr/><li>
After meeting with Eda, a Masters student who wanted to work on a research project with me, the first note in my research journal was &#34;discussed rewind: cool idea but low chance of publishing&#34;. I had no idea how true that would be, as this became the most challenging paper my group would publish. What started in January 2015 was published December 2018, 4 years later, and was passed from student to student after each one graduated. I lost count of the number of rejections.</li><hr/><li>
This was the first time I had been involved in a project with both hardware and software components, so the system itself took longer than expected, and we were writing this paper down to the deadline. The paper had to be carefully crafted to describe a complex configuration, with 3D-printed parts, augmented reality, cameras and sensors, computer vision, heating and energy issues, and both wired and wireless networking.</li><hr/><li>
Nedi turned her earlier SleepCoacher paper into a fully automated process, completing our vision from the seed of an idea 6 years ago. The product described in this paper was shipped to the app stores and used by whoever would come across and download it, basically real usage by people we did not recruit. We maintained Android and iOS apps separately, and a server to do the calculations. It was a costly mistake to build out three separate systems; we should have started with something cross-platform and performed the calculations in the app itself to reduce the software maintenance from three systems to one.</li><hr/><li>
This idea grew out of my NSF CAREER Award as the required educational component, where I proposed a classroom tool for large-class simultaneous design activities. But the code was written and rewritten several times by different teams even after that, because running a real-time collaborative system with over 100 simultaneous users introduced its own share of problems.</li><hr/><li>
In 2014, I met with a faculty member in Psychiatry and Human Behavior to discuss a collaboration, where we concluded that the area of mental health lacked innovative computational techniques. I did a rough prototype of our initial idea in 2015, then students picked it up the following year. The work was passed between teams of students, mainly supporting the application development and real usage from a growing list of collaborators. It turns out that many clinical researchers felt the same, and this became our most funded project.</li><hr/><li>
We had been wanting to expand Nedi&#39;s SleepBandits app beyond sleep to all sorts of self-experimentation, and finally got a chance when NSF extended one of my expiring grants to fund this paper.</li></ol><hr/>
<h3 id="introspection">Introspection</h3>

<p>After reviewing these notes, I&#39;m a bit ambivalent. When I was a clueless student, I got lucky with my collaborators and acceptance decisions, which made all the difference. After becoming a professor, I had the experience yet the papers take even longer to publish.</p>
<p>Part of <em>why</em> is the focus on systems papers, which are <a href="http://dubfuture.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-give-up-on-chiuist.html">known to take 3-4 years</a>, but shipping them as products has been an even longer 4+ year agenda. Worth it, sure, but we&#39;ll never be like most groups that publish 5+ papers a year.</p>
<p>But I also think about how my group has encountered a lot of rejection, and keeping up morale was sometimes difficult. Bad news injects doubt and discouragement into students&#39; minds, who then have to rally the team to continue the work in hope that acceptance is just around the corner. This dissonance is hard to manage.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed is that papers that get the most citations later often got poor reviews or multiple rejections. They&#39;re usually about a new phenomenon, but the novelty can always be recast as &#34;old thing, but just on the web&#34; or &#34;mostly engineering work, with so-so results&#34;. With this in mind, I should probably be generous in my own interpretation of what&#39;s novel when I review papers.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I am grateful for many key collaborators for their extra help in those times, and that some conferences like UIST accepted papers despite some obvious flaw because those papers ended up defining long-term research programs for multiple young researchers.</p>
<p>Thanks to Alexandra Papoutsaki, Bo Lu, Gifford Cheung, Tongyu Zhou, and Zainab Iftikhar for their comments on earlier drafts.</p>

      <title>Bringing NetBSD to Zig&#39;s Continuous Integration</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___wf_lavatech_top_lun-4_bringing-netbsd-to-zigs-continuous-integration/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello, if this is your first time reading this, I&#39;m luna, one half of <a href="https://lavatech.top/" rel="nofollow">LavaTech</a> and we provide continuous integration (CI) services for the <a href="https://ziglang.org/" rel="nofollow">Zig programming language</a>.</p>

<p>We started doing this because Zig could not use their pre-existing CI service for FreeBSD builds, <a href="https://sr.ht" rel="nofollow">sr.ht</a>, because the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6485" rel="nofollow">compiler became very RAM-intensive</a> and that hits the limits on their CI. We stepped in and we now provide a <a href="https://builds.hut.lavatech.top/" rel="nofollow">selfhosted Sourcehut instance</a> where FreeBSD builds can still happen while the self-hosted compiler is not finished yet (Genuinely, I have no idea what will happen once the memory usage is brought down, but for now, I&#39;m happy to provide the service, and wish to continue).</p>

<p>On a sunny day with nothing much to do, I decided to bring better NetBSD support for Zig, and one of the areas I can learn on is the one where I&#39;m operating: CI.</p>

<p>This blogpost outlines the things I had to do to bring NetBSD to Zig CI.</p>

<h2 id="some-background-or-how-does-ci-work">Some background, or, How does CI work</h2>

<p><a href="https://sourcehut.org/" rel="nofollow">Sourcehut</a> is a “software forge”, which is a collection of tools to manage codebases, either publicly or privately. sr.ht is the <a href="https://sr.ht/" rel="nofollow">main instance</a> of Sourcehut, operated by its original creator, Drew Devault.</p>

<p>builds.sr.ht, the CI service of Sourcehut, works by providing QEMU/KVM virtual machines that run specifically-crafted operating system images, and from them, your project can be built and the resulting artifacts can be tested inside the virtual machine, all via executing SSH into the VM. After all the commands are run without errors, the build has “passed”. <a href="https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/job/97412" rel="nofollow">An example of builds.sr.ht on the main instance can be seen here</a></p>

<p>The outline of the available VM images can be seen in the <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/compatibility.md" rel="nofollow">compatibility page of builds.sr.ht</a>, and from there you can see Alpine Linux, Arch Linux, FreeBSD, among others (hell, even 9front!).</p>

<h2 id="netbsd-on-sr-ht">NetBSD on sr.ht</h2>

<p>Back when I was developing support for it, the compatibility page did not mention NetBSD, and thanks to Michael Forney, it now is!</p>

<p>The history for it is as follows:
 – The initial versions of the NetBSD image were created by Drew Devault.
 – However, they <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev/%3CBXW5IXAF5BP2.2BHCF8T5SOU75%40homura%3E" rel="nofollow">weren&#39;t really finished</a>.
 – I began working on finishing it.
 – Michael Forney also began working on it, in parallel. Their patch <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev/patches/23160" rel="nofollow">has been successfully upstreamed</a>!
 – Even though we worked in parallel, our changes are mostly equivalent and so, there isn&#39;t a need to upstream my changes:
   – Replacing anita (The automated NetBSD installer) for directly downloading the binary sets and partitioning the virtual disk. This is done to remove the QEMU requirement on the build script, because I am building the image in a NetBSD VM itself, and I was not sure on how to bring nested virtualization to it.
    – Replacing <a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/" rel="nofollow">pkgsrc</a> building source packages with downloading binary packages via <a href="https://pkgin.net/" rel="nofollow">pkgin</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://builds.hut.lavatech.top/~lun4/job/9035" rel="nofollow">Here is a successful test build with the image!</a></p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-ci">Preparing the CI</h2>

<p>Zig CI does not depend on the upstream platforms&#39; LLVM builds. Instead, a self-built LLVM is created via the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap" rel="nofollow">zig-bootstrap</a> project. With it, you can go from a C compiler to a fully functioning Zig compiler for any architecture. It achieves this via four large compile steps (with the relevant names I will use for them throughout this blogpost):
 – Compiling LLVM for the host system (“llvm-host”).
 – Compiling Zig for the host system (“zig-host”).
 – Compiling LLVM for the target system (“llvm-crosscompiled”).
 – Compiling Zig for the target system (“zig-crosscompiled”).</p>

<p>With, for example, the zig-bootstrap result for <code>aarch64-linux-musl</code>, you can start an ARM64 Linux CI, where zig-crosscompiled compiles the new commits of Zig. This is possible because Zig <a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/#zig-is-also-a-c-compiler" rel="nofollow">is a C compiler as well</a>. <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/ci/azure/linux_script" rel="nofollow">Here&#39;s the script for Zig Linux CI on Azure</a> of such artifacts working in a CI script (<code>$CACHE_BASENAME</code>).</p>

<p>For NetBSD, the process shouldn&#39;t be different (FreeBSD follows it as well), so what we need to do is get zig-bootstrap running on it. This process took a couple of days, with help of <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/" rel="nofollow">andrewrk</a> and <a href="https://washbear.neocities.org/" rel="nofollow">washbear</a>, and long arduous moments of the having to cyclically “Start the build, find something to do, mentally switch back to fixing the build”. It all paid off, and I generated fantastic quickfixes in the end! <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig-bootstrap/pull/60" rel="nofollow">Here they all are!</a>.</p>

<p>The submitted PR is more of a discussion place about what can be done regarding my workarounds, rather than putting all of them into zig-bootstrap (because I am pretty sure some of those fixes would break... every other target, lol).</p>

<h2 id="spinning-up-new-infrastructure-for-ci">Spinning up new infrastructure for CI</h2>

<p>builds.sr.ht has the idea of build runners for jobs, so you can dynamically add more capacity for CI as needed. Each runner can have N workers, and those are the ones running QEMU VMs.</p>

<p>As we started with FreeBSD, we learned that a single worker requires 16GB RAM (the actual compile requirements are approximately 8GB, but there are a lot of build artifacts, the filesystem for the VM is composed of both the image and a growing temporary ramdisk). And as time passed, we learned that 4 build workers can handle the throughput needed by Zig when it comes to FreeBSD (as of July 2021, this is true).</p>

<p>To have NetBSD support added to the mix, we would have to add 4 build workers to the network, which means finding 64GB of available RAM somewhere in our infrastructure. LavaTech operates in a hybrid cloud model: There are VPS&#39;es in various cloud providers, but most of our services run in our own colocated hardware, shared with <a href="http://generalprogramming.org/" rel="nofollow">general programming</a>. We are able to do so because of Hurricane Electric&#39;s <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipv6/comments/g6v7b2/hurricane_electric_no_longer_offers_free_bgp/foisizz/" rel="nofollow">free colo deal</a>. Also, <a href="https://as208590.net/" rel="nofollow">Peer with us!</a></p>

<p>In general, our rack has two power supply units, one big momma computer (of which we kindly hostnamed it “laserjet”, it was close to being “HP-LaserJet-Enterprise-MFP”), and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_server" rel="nofollow">blades</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There will not be a hard requirement for this list (or the infrastructure mentioned in this article) to be updated as time passes.</strong></p>

<p>And this is the build runner allocation before NetBSD work:
 – runner1: Laserjet VM (2 workers)
 – runner2: Laserjet VM (2 workers)</p>

<p>After talking to our friends at generalprogramming, we were able to allocate two more runners:
 – runner3: GP Blade (2 workers)
 – runner4: GP Blade (2 workers)</p>

<p>However, they were unstable as time passed, and we decided to rent a server which would take care of both FreeBSD and NetBSD:
 – bigrunner: Hetzner Rented Server (8 workers)</p>

<p>runner1 and runner2 were decommissioned to decrease load on Laserjet. runner3 and runner4 were decommissioned because of their instability.</p>

<p>One infrastructure note to keep in mind is that we aren&#39;t using all of the available blades in the rack, because of power issues. The PSUs can handle 20A maximum current, and we have both of them so that we can stay redundant. Even though we have 40A theoretical max current to be used, we must only use 20A max, and we were already on that limit. <a href="https://wf.lavatech.top/lavatech-incidents/june-15-2021-outage-postmortem" rel="nofollow">Foreshadowing: A recent failure in the datacenter brought down one of the PSUs and our router was not plugged into both, causing an outage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-collection-of-operation-problems-that-happened-in-the-build-network-while-getting-netbsd-ci-up">A collection of operation problems that happened in the build network while getting NetBSD CI up</h2>

<h3 id="accidental-ramdisk-in-production-july-12th-2021">Accidental Ramdisk in Production (July 12th 2021)</h3>

<p>The issue was first identified by seeing jobs close successfully with “Connection to localhost closed by remote host”. This is bad (it should fail, really), but we knew that it was <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/builds.sr.ht/292" rel="nofollow">related to the OOM killer, as we had it before</a>.</p>

<p>We noticed that the RAM usage on affected runners was 50%, even though no CI jobs were running on them. Before deciding to reboot, thinking it was some cursed I/O caching eating RAM (it wasn&#39;t, after checking <code>free</code> output), I checked <code>df</code> and found that the rootfs was a tmpfs, not something like ext4.</p>

<p>Turns out I accidentally installed those runners on the alpine livecd ramdisk. I didn&#39;t run <code>setup-alpine</code>. The motd as you enter a shell tells you to run it. I don&#39;t know how I missed it.</p>

<p>After backing up the important data (build logs), I was able to properly recreate them. Since I knew that more runners were bound to be created in the future, I wrote a <a href="https://pyinfra.com/" rel="nofollow">pyinfra</a> script to set everything up beforehand, and became a fangirl of it afterwards. Oh well, it happens.</p>

<h3 id="network-timeouts-july-13th-2021-and-beyond">Network Timeouts (July 13th 2021 and beyond)</h3>

<p>Sometimes connectivity to the builds service simply times out with <code>curl: (7) Failed to connect to builds.hut.lavatech.top port 443: Host is unreachable</code>.</p>

<p>There are high packet losses, maybe because of one of our network upstreams, but I can&#39;t dive deeper into this issue. Hopefully it isn&#39;t as frequent.</p>

<h3 id="docker-networking-mishaps-july-13th-2021">Docker networking mishaps (July 13th 2021)</h3>

<p>Jobs simply didn&#39;t start with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name &#34;/builds_job_unknown_1626160482&#34; is already in use by container &#34;90c8a6c874840755e9b75db5b3d9b223fbc00ba0a540b60f43d78378efc4376a&#34;. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
</code></pre>

<p>The name of the Docker container running QEMU is decided in the control script, here&#39;s the relevant snippet of code:</p>

<pre><code>        --name &#34;builds_job_${BUILD_JOB_ID:-unknown_$(date +&#34;%s&#34;)}&#34; \
</code></pre>

<p>The script that actually boots the VM containing a CI job is the <code>control</code> script, usually found in <code>/var/lib/images/control</code> (when using the Alpine Linux Sourcehut packages, at least). Sourcehut documentation says that the user running that script should be locked down to only being able to run it so that vulnerabilities on the worker process don&#39;t lead to a privilege escalation. That is done via the <code>doas</code> utility, an alternative to <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p>A missing parameter on the <code>doas.conf</code> file makes the control script run without any environment variables, since <code>BUILD_JOB_ID</code> is missing, it uses <code>date +&#34;%s&#34;</code>.</p>

<p>This issue didn&#39;t arise until NetBSD builds were merged into Zig. Before that happened, we only spawned a single job per PR: the FreeBSD one. However, after adding NetBSD, we started spawning two jobs per PR. Since they were close in time, the container names would be the same, one of them would work, and the other would crash with the aforementioned error.</p>

<h3 id="vm-settling-times-out-july-28th-2021">VM Settling times out (July 28th 2021)</h3>

<p>Some VMs were timing out on their settling, but only when the machine was under load (such as after a merge spree in the Zig project). When running a CI job, a new VM is created running the specific OS image, then a “settling” task is run for it. The task attempts to SSH into the virtual machine, run <code>echo &#34;hello world&#34;</code>, and if that works, send the rest of the commands (cloning the repo, running the scripts declared in <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/44ef270de1b8dfd176f27adf5638ca2f36d700d5/.builds/freebsd.yml" rel="nofollow">the YAML manifest</a>, etc).</p>

<p>We were always missing timing on it, so by the time I connected to the runner, it was fine and stable. But by the date mentioned in the subtitle, we were able to catch it in real time, and saw that the load numbers are close to 16, even though the runner has 8 cores total.</p>

<p>Turns out the CI VMs have 2 cores allocated to them, that&#39;s hardcoded in the control script.</p>

<p>Current solution: Edit the control script to make the VMs be single-core.</p>

<p>Possible future solution: Buy more servers</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<ul><li>It works, and zig provides <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/" rel="nofollow">master versions of the compiler</a> for NetBSD!</li>
<li>It might take a while until I decide to add OpenBSD into the mix.</li>
<li>All of this should have a status page and log analysis to find CI failures that were caused by operation errors, instead of false-positives due to someone writing incomplete code in a work-in-progress PR.</li></ul>

      <title>Scylla&#39;s Approach to Improve Performance for CPU-Bound Workloads (2017)</title>
      <link>https://www.scylladb.com/2017/07/06/scyllas-approach-improve-performance-cpu-bound-workloads/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_scylladb_com_2017_07_06_scyllas-approach-improve-performance-cpu-bound-workloads_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p><span>A database like Scylla can be limited by the network, disk I/O or the processor. Which one it is often dynamic and depends on both the hardware configuration and the workload. The only way of dealing with that is to attempt to achieve good throughput and low latency regardless of what is the bottleneck. There are many things that can be done in each of these cases that range from high-level changes in the algorithms to very low-level tweaks. In this post, I am going to take a closer look at fairly recent changes to Scylla which improved the performance for the CPU-bound workloads.</span></p>


<p><span><span>When it comes to investigating situations when the CPU is the bottleneck </span><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html"><span>Flame Graphs</span></a><span> are truly invaluable. They can quickly point you to a part of the code that is much slower than it feels it should be and armed with that information appropriate steps can be taken in order to optimize it. Unfortunately, knowing how much processor time was spent in particular functions may be not enough. When the CPU is busy it may be so because it is actually doing some work or is stalled waiting for memory, as Brendan Gregg has explained it very well in </span><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-05-09/cpu-utilization-is-wrong.html"><span>this post</span></a><span>. A useful metric that can be used to quickly determine whether the processor stalls are an issue is the number of completed instructions per cycle (IPC). If it is low, less than 1, it is very likely that the application is, in fact, memory bound.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Even though IPC can be very useful in pointing the performance analysis in the right direction it is certainly not enough to fully understand the problem. Fortunately, modern processors have Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) which gives insight into what is actually happening at the microarchitectural level. The amount of the available information can be quite overwhelming unless an appropriate methodology is used.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A very handy tool for collecting and analyzing data provided by the PMU is </span><a href="https://github.com/andikleen/pmu-tools/wiki/toplev-manual"><span>toplev</span></a><span>. It employs the </span><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/top-down-microarchitecture-analysis-method-lin"><span>Top-Down Analysis</span></a><span>, which uses a hierarchical representation of the processor architecture to keep track of pipeline slots. This enables tools like toplev to show the percentages of slots the were stalled, wasted by bad speculation or used by a successfully retired instruction.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The diagram below shows, in a very simplified way, the microarchitecture of a modern x86 CPU from the point of view of Top-Down Analysis. There are many things missing, but it should be sufficient for the purposes of this post.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><strong> Microarchitecture of a modern x86 CPU</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At the top level, there are four major categories Front End Bound, Back-End Bound, Bad Speculation and Retiring. The first two mean that there was a stall, Bad Speculation denotes pipeline slots that did the work that was not necessary because of a branch misprediction and slots classified as Retiring were able to successfully retire the µop that was being executed.</span></p>
<p><span>Processor’s front end is responsible for fetching and decoding instructions that are going to be executed. It may become a bottleneck when there is either a latency problem or the bandwidth is not sufficient. The former can be caused, for example, by instruction cache misses. The latter happens when the instruction decoders cannot keep up, the solution there may be to attempt to make the hot path, or at least significant portions of it, fit in the decoded µop cache (DSB) or be recognizable by the loop detector (LSD).</span></p>
<p><span>Pipeline slots classified by the Top-Down Analysis as Bad Speculation are not stalled but wasted. This happens when a branch is mispredicted and the rest of the CPU executes a µop that eventually cannot be committed. While the branch predictor is generally considered to be a part of the front end, its problems can affect the whole pipeline in a different way than just causing the back end to be undersupplied by the instruction fetch and decode.</span></p>
<p><span>Back end receives decoded µops and executes them. A stall may happen either because of an execution port being busy or a cache miss. At the lower level, a pipeline slot may be core bound either due to data dependency or an insufficient number of available execution units. Stalls caused by memory can be caused by cache misses at different levels of data cache, external memory latency or bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, there are pipeline slots which get classified as Retiring. They are the lucky ones that were able to execute and commit their µop without any problems. When 100% pipeline slots are able to retire without a stall then the program has achieved the maximum number of instructions per cycle for that model of the CPU. Whilst very desirable this, however, doesn’t mean that there is nothing to improve. It just means that the CPU is fully utilized and the only way to improve the performance is to reduce the number of instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s see then what toplev has to say about Scylla 1.7. Unless stated otherwise all test results shown in this post are read workloads with 75,000,000 one-row partitions. The entire population fits in memory, there are no cache misses. There is a single Scylla server with 4 cores (the processor is an eight-core Haswell) and 64GB of memory. The loader is a single 4 core (8 logical CPUs) machine running 4 scylla-bench processes each pinned to its own core. The 1Gbit network is far from being saturated since the partitions are very small. The purpose of this setup is to ensure that Scylla is actually CPU bound.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Toplev Test Results – Before SEDA</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The message the PMU is trying to convey here is quite clear. Scylla is completely dominated by the front end, instruction cache misses in particular. If we think about this for a moment it shouldn’t really be very surprising, though. The pipeline that each client request goes through is quite long. For example, write requests may need to go through transport protocol logic, CQL layer, coordinator code, then it becomes a commitlog write and then it is applied to the memtable. The situation is no better for reads, which means that individual Scylla requests usually involve a lot of logic and relatively little data, which is a scenario that stresses the CPU front end significantly.</span></p>

<p><span>Once the problem has been diagnosed it is time to come up with a solution. The most obvious one is to attempt to reduce the amount of logic in the hot path. Unfortunately, this is not something that has a huge potential for a significant performance improvement. The CQL protocol supports prepared statements which allow splitting the preparation and the execution part of the request processing so that as much work as possible can be pushed out of the hot path. Scylla already does all that, so while there undoubtedly are some things that could be improved they are unlikely to make a big difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Another thing to consider is templates and inline functions. Both Scylla and Seastar are heavy users of those which brings the risk of ending up with excessively bloated binaries. However, this is quite tricky since inlining can, in some situations, actually reduce the amount of code in the hot path if the inlined function can be subject to some optimizations that wouldn’t be otherwise possible. One particular place where we have seen a significant difference was serialization code which was writing several fixed size objects. Because the size of the object to serialize was known at the compile time if the serialization functions were inlined the compiler was able to constant-fold them to just a few instructions, significantly improving the overall performance. The point is that whether to inline or not is more a matter of fine-tuning which has the disadvantage of making any optimizations fragile and is probably unlikely to cause a huge improvement.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Keen readers of GCC documentation will notice that there is optimization flag “</span><span>-freorder-blocks-and-partition”</span><span> which promises to split hot and cold parts of the function and place them at different locations. This sounds very encouraging, but unfortunately, that flag works only with PGO (Profile-Guided Optimisation) and conflicts with the support for stack unwinding, which is required by the C++ exception implementation. The bottom line is that this flag, sadly, is unusable for Scylla.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is, however, a higher level way of dealing with instruction cache problems. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture"><span>SEDA</span></a><span> (Staged Event-Driven Architecture) is a server architecture that splits the request processing pipeline into a graph of stages. Each stage represents a part of the server logic and consists of a queue and a thread pool. The main problem of this architecture are context switches and inter-processor communication when requests are moved between stages, but this can be partially alleviated by processing them in batches. This is all very friendly towards the instruction cache since each thread executes always the same operation, multiple times before a context switch happens, so the code locality can be expected to be very good. Unfortunately, while such architecture can be acceptable when the focus is primarily on achieving high throughput, it is rather unsuitable for low-latency applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Scylla is using Thread Per Core architecture which avoids context switches and minimizes inter-processor communication making it much better suited for <a href="https://www.p99conf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low latency</a> tasks than SEDA. However, the ability to insert queues in the request processing pipeline which would allow batching some of the operations is something that could be very useful, provided that it is done carefully lest it hurts latency. That’s exactly what we implemented.</span></p>

<p><span>The idea to deal with front-end latency problem was to process certain function calls in batches so that the first invocation warms up the instruction cache and the subsequent ones can execute with a minimal number of icache misses.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Fortunately, the fact that Seastar is based on future, promise, continuation model made it very easy to introduce execution stages to the existing code. Let’s say we have some server code with </span><span>process_request()</span><span> function that calls internal </span><span>do_process_request()</span><span> which contains the actual logic:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><span><span>future&lt;response&gt; do_process_request(request r);</span>

<span>future&lt;response&gt; process_request(request r) {</span>
 <span>    return do_process_request(std::move(r));</span>
 <span>}</span></span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><span><span>Execution stages were implemented as wrappers that produce a function object with almost the same signature as the original function. Now, if we want to batch calls to do_process_request() we can write:</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><span><span>future&lt;response&gt; do_process_request(request r);</span>

<span>thread_local auto processing_stage = seastar::make_execution_stage(&#34;processing-stage&#34;, do_process_request);</span>

<span>future&lt;response&gt; process_request(request r) {</span>
<span>    return processing_stage(std::move(r));</span>
<span>}

</span></span></pre>

<p><span><span>The changes to the code are rather minimal, but nothing more is needed. Instead of a call to do_process_request() there is an invocation of the processing_stage object which can freely decide when to call the original function which result will be forwarded to the future returned by the execution stage.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What happens underneath is that each call to the execution stage pushes the function arguments to a queue and returns a future that will be resolved when the function call actually happens. At some point the execution stage is going to be flushed, a new task is going to be scheduled that would execute all of the queued function calls. This is when one has to be careful as the last sentence has introduced two potential latency problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Firstly, while having large batches is beneficial, function calls must not be kept in the queue for too long. The solution is fairly easy, Seastar periodically polls for new events and makes an effort to ensure that this doesn’t happen less often than once per a specified interval called task quota. Execution stages register themselves as pollers and flush the queue when they are polled. If the server is heavily loaded the stages are going to be flushed not less often than once per task quota and if the server is lightly loaded the flush is going to happen every time there are no other tasks to run. The batches can be quite small in this case, but keeping the latency low is more important.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Secondly, it is possible that processing the whole batch of function calls may take a lot of time. This could ruin the latency of other tasks, so the execution stage needs to respect the task quota itself and interrupt executing the queued function calls if its time quota runs out. Again, that is something that may limit the size of the batches and the overall effectiveness of the execution stages, but this is a trade-off between the latency and throughput and the proper solution is somewhere in the middle ground.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With the execution stages </span><a href="http://docs.seastar-project.org/master/group__execution-stages.html"><span>implemented</span></a><span> at the Seastar level, it was quite easy to introduce them to Scylla. They were added more or less in places where request processing moves from one subsystem to another.</span></span></p>

<li><span><span>Database write – there is </span><a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/ef428d008cedb4861ddb69ca07c58e46c40a28ea/database.cc#L3201"><span>an execution stage</span></a><span> before the database write implementation that collects incoming requests both from local and remote coordinators.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Database read – Scylla reads are either data queries or mutation queries. The former is more lightweight used for single-partition reads while the latter is used for range queries and as a fallback for data queries. Both have their own </span><a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/ef428d008cedb4861ddb69ca07c58e46c40a28ea/database.cc#L2782"><span>execution</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/ef428d008cedb4861ddb69ca07c58e46c40a28ea/mutation_partition.cc#L2020"><span>stages</span></a><span> now.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>It is time to finally show some numbers. The load is, again, reads with no cache miss, the server is CPU bound. Let’s look at the throughput first.</span></p>

<p><span>That’s a significant improvement, but it is worth ensuring that the latencies didn’t fall victim to the function call batching. In order to test this, the loaders were limited to 28,000 operations per second. The graph below compares 99th percentile request latencies of Scylla 1.7 with and without execution stage patches.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Execution Stage Latency</strong></p>
<p><span>The latencies are actually slightly better. This can be attributed to the fact that the penalty of moderate batching is lower than the performance increase caused by better instruction cache locality. Summary of a 15-minute run shows the general reduction of request latency.</span></p>

<p><span><span>The increase in throughput is accompanied by an increase of IPC (Instructions Per Cycle), as reported by </span><span>perf stat</span><span>, from around 0.81 to 1.31. The ratio of instruction cache misses is reduced from 5.39% to 3.05%. Toplev results have changed as well:</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Toplev Test Results – After SEDA</strong></p>
<p><span>‘The front-end latency issues are, clearly, still there, but they are not dominating as much as they used to do. The bandwidth of the front end is also limiting Scylla performance when the instructions are being issued by the MITE (MicroInstruction Translation Engine), as opposed to the decoded icache or the loop detector. There are also L1 cache misses which make the back end a more important bottleneck than it was before.</span></p>
<p><span>The introduction of execution stages did not eliminate instruction cache misses to the point that toplev doesn’t notice them, but at this point simply adding more stages is not necessarily the best solution. Each stage potentially hurts latency so they have to be added wisely and carefully. The important thing that impacts the effectiveness of the stage are the sizes of the batches we can actually get. Appropriate metrics were introduced to monitor that. For the read test data query stage on each shard has been processing around 58,000 function calls per second and scheduling 1,000 batches per second which make the average batch size of 58. This is certainly not bad but is going to be much lower if the Scylla isn’t fully loaded or the network or disk I/O is a bottleneck and when the batches are small the stages become an overhead rather than an improvement. One cannot also forget that the batching is an enemy of the latency and if it made too aggressive the latency penalty may outweigh the benefits of the better instruction cache locality. So, while it would be tempting to try to make batching aggressive, it is not necessarily a right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>What could be beneficial is more fine tuning of the positions where the actual queues are introduced in the pipeline. As it was mentioned before, execution stages were added more or less at the conceptual boundaries of the Scylla subsystems which doesn’t necessarily mean that these are the optimal places. However, at this point, it becomes more and more a matter of fine-tuning and while it could still allow us to squeeze even more performance from Scylla it can be quite fragile when the code changes and it may be more worthwhile to focus on the other bottlenecks.</span></p>

<p><span>Function call batching inspired by SEDA has brought a major performance improvement for CPU-bound loads and helped to shift the bottleneck to the other parts of the processor microarchitecture. The change itself wasn’t very intrusive nor was it complex, but it has significantly increased the throughput in the cases where instruction cache misses were the limiting factor. With proper methodology for analyzing information provided by the PMU, it was relatively easy to find out what the problem was and choose the most cost effective solution. There are still many things that could be done to improve the performance but this has to be done step by step, each time dealing with the current most significant bottleneck and in this case, the goal of reducing its impact have been definitely achieved.</span></p>

      <title>; Echo “Shell Injection”</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io//2021/07/30/shell-injection.html</link>

  <div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>This is an introductory article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection#Shell_injection">shell injection</a>, a security vulnerability allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user’s machine.
This is a well-studied problem, and there are simple and efficient solutions to it.
It’s relatively easy to design library API in such a way as to shield the application developer from the risk of shell injections.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why I am writing this post.
First, this year I’ve pointed out this issue in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ls096k/rust_cmd_lib_v010_to_write_shellscript_like_tasks/goqlv3m/">three</a> <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/9yu5sl/after_discussion_here_i_created_lib_for#c_ckkova">different</a> <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/p1hict/zxpy_tool_for_shell_scripting_python#c_zuaapx">libraries</a>.
It seems that, although the problem is well-studied, its not well known, so just repeating some things might help.
Second, I’ve recently reported a related problem about one of the VS Code APIs, and I want to use this piece as an extended GitHub comment :-)</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="a-curious-case-of-pwnd-script"><a href="#a-curious-case-of-pwnd-script"></a>A Curious Case Of Pwnd Script</h2>
<div>
<p>Shell injection can happen when a program needs to execute another program, and one of the arguments is controlled by the user/attacker.
As a model example, let’s write a quick script to read a list of URLs from stdin, and run <code>curl</code> for each one of those.</p>
<p>That’s not realistic, but small and illustrative.
This is what the script could look like in NodeJS:</p>

<p>Here, we use are using <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback"><code>exec</code></a> API from node to spawn a child <code>curl</code> process, passing a line of input as an argument.</p>
<p>Seems to work for simple cases?</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>That feels bad — seems that the script somehow reads the contents of my <code>/etc/passwd</code>.
How did this happen, we’ve only invoked <code>curl</code>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="spawning-a-process"><a href="#spawning-a-process"></a>Spawning a Process</h2>
<div>
<p>To understand what have just happened, we need to learn a bit about how spawning a process works in general.
This section is somewhat UNIX-specific — things are implemented a bit differently on Windows.
Nonetheless, the big picture conclusions hold there as well.</p>
<p>The main API to run a program with command line arguments is the <code>exec</code> family of functions.
For example, here’s <code>execve</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="c"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>int</span> <span>execve</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>pathname</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>argv</span><span>[],</span>
           <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>envp</span><span>[]);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>It takes the name of the program (<code>pathname</code>), a list of command line arguments (<code>argv</code>), and a list of environment variable for the new process (<code>envp</code>), and uses those to run the specified binary.
How exactly this happens is a fascinating story with many forks in the plot, but it is beyond the scope of the article.</p>
<p>What is curious though, is that while the underlying system API wants an array of arguments, the <code>child_process.exec</code> function from node takes only a single string: <code>exec(&#34;curl http://example.com&#34;)</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s find out!
To do that, we’ll use the <a href="https://strace.io">strace</a> tool.
This tool inspects (traces) all the system calls invoked by the program.
We’ll ask <code>strace</code> to look for <code>execve</code> in particular, to understand how node’s <code>exec</code> maps to the underlying system’s API.
We’ll need the <code>--follow</code> argument to trace all processes, and not just the top-level one.
To reduce the amount of output and only print <code>execve</code>, we’ll use the <code>--trace</code> flag:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>$ strace --follow --trace execve node main.js &lt; urls.txt
execve(&#34;/bin/node&#34;, [&#34;node&#34;, &#34;curl-all.js&#34;], 0x7fff97776be0)
...
execve(&#34;/bin/sh&#34;, [&#34;/bin/sh&#34;, &#34;-c&#34;, &#34;curl https://example.com&#34;], 0x3fcacc0)
...
execve(&#34;/bin/curl&#34;, [&#34;curl&#34;, &#34;https://example.com&#34;], 0xec4008)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first <code>execve</code> we see here is our original invocation of the <code>node</code> binary itself.
The last one is what we want to do — spawn <code>curl</code> with a single argument, an url.
And the middle one is what node’s <code>exec</code> actually does.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>/bin/sh -c &#34;curl https://example.com&#34;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, node invokes the <code>sh</code> binary (system’s shell) with two arguments: <code>-c</code> and the string we originally passed to <code>child_process.exec</code>.
<code>-c</code> stands for command, and instructs the shell to interpret the value as a shell command, parse, it and then run it.</p>
<p>In other words, rather then running the command directly, node asks the shell to do the heavy lifting.
But the shell is an interpreter of the shell language, and, by carefully crafting the input to <code>exec</code>, we can ask it to run arbitrary code.
In particular, that’s what we used as a payload in the bad example above:</p>
<div>
<p>malice_in_the_wonderland.txt</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>; echo &#39;PWNED, reading your secrets from /etc/passwd&#39; &amp;&amp; cat /etc/passwd
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the string interpolation, the resulting command was</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>/bin/sh -c &#34;curl; echo &#39;...&#39; &amp;&amp; cat /etc/passwd&#34;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, first run <code>curl</code>, then <code>echo</code>, then read the <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>There’s an equivalent safe API in node: <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options"><code>spawn</code></a>.
unlike <code>exec</code>, it uses an array of arguments rather then a single string.</p>

<p>Internally, the API bypasses the shell and uses <code>execve</code> directly.
Thus, this API is not vulnerable to shell injection — attacked can run <code>curl</code> with bad arguments, but it can’t run something else than <code>curl</code>.</p>
<p>Note that it’s easy to implement <code>exec</code> in terms of <code>spawn</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>It’s a common pattern among many languages:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there’s an <code>exec</code>-style function that takes a string and spawns <code>/bin/sh -c</code> under the hood,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the docs for this function include a giant disclaimer, saying that using it with user input is a bad idea,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there’s a safe alternative which takes arguments as an array and spawns the process directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Why provide an exploitable API, while a safe version is possible and is more direct?
I don’t know, but my guess is that it’s mostly just history.
C has <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/system"><code>system</code></a>, Perl’s backticks correspond directly to that, Ruby got backticks from Perl, Python just has <code>system</code>, node was probably influenced by all these scripting languages.</p>
<p>Note that security isn’t the only issue with <code>/bin/sh -c</code> based API.

<div>
<p>If you are an <em>application developer</em>, be aware that this issue exists.
Read the language documentation carefully — most likely, there are two flavors of process spawning functions.
Note how shell injection is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a>.</p>
<p>If you <em>develop a library</em> for conveniently working with external processes, use and expose only the shell-less API from the underlying platform.</p>
<p>If you <em>build a new platform</em>, don’t provide <code>bin/sh -c</code> API in the first place.
Be like <a href="https://deno.land/manual@v1.12.2/examples/subprocess">deno</a> (and also Go, Rust, Julia), don’t be like <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback">node</a> (and also Python, Ruby, Perl, C).
If you <em>have</em> to maintain such API for legacy reasons, clearly document the issue about shell injection.
Documenting how to do <code>/bin/sh -c</code> by hand might also be a good idea.</p>
<p>If you are <em>designing a programming language</em>, be careful with string interpolation syntax.
It’s important that string interpolation can be used to spawn a command in a safe way.
That mostly means that library authors should be able to deconstruct a <code>&#34;cmd -j $arg1 -f $arg2&#34;</code> literal into two (compile-time) arrays: <code>[&#34;cmd -j &#34;, &#34; -f &#34;]</code> and <code>[arg1, arg2]</code>.
If you don’t provide this feature in the language, library authors will split the interpolated string, which would be unsafe (not only for shelling out — for SQLing or HTMLing as well).
Good examples to learn from are JavaScript’s
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">tagged templates</a>
and Julia’s
<a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2013/04/put-this-in-your-pipe/#do-nothing_backticks">backticks</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>Oh, right, the actual reason why I am writing this thing.
The TL;DR for this section is that I want to complain about a specific API design a bit.</p>
<p>This story begins in <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/9058">#9058</a>.</p>
<p>I was happily hacking on some Rust library.
At some point I pressed the “run tests” button in <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io">rust-analyzer</a>.
And, surprised, accidentally pwned myself!</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

failed to launch (exit code: 1).

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That was disappointing.
C’mon, how come there’s a shell injection in the code I help to maintain?
While this is not a big problem for rust-analyzer (our security model assumes trusted code, as each of <code>rustup</code>, <code>cargo</code>, and <code>rustc</code> can execute arbitrary code by design), it’s definitely was big blow to my aesthetics sensibilities!</p>
<p>Looking at the git history, it was me who had missed “concatenate arguments into a single string” during review.
So I was definitely a part of the problem here.
But the other part is that the API that takes a single string exists at all.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the API:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ts"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6

</pre></td><td><pre><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ShellExecution</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/**
    * Creates a shell execution with a full command line.
    *
    * @param commandLine The command line to execute.
    * @param options Optional options for the started the shell.
    */</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>commandLine</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>
    <span>options</span><span>?:</span> <span>ShellExecutionOptions</span>
  <span>);</span>

  <span>/* ... */</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, this is exactly what I am describing — a process-spawning API that takes a single string.
I guess, in this case this <em>might</em> even be justified — the API opens a literal shell in the GUI, and the user can interact with it after the command finishes.</p>
<p>Anyway, after looking around I quickly found another API, which <em>seemed</em> (ominous music in the background) like what I was looking for:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ts"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>command</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>|</span> <span>ShellQuotedString</span><span>,</span>

    <span>options</span><span>?:</span> <span>ShellExecutionOptions</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The API takes a array of strings.
It also tries to say something about quoting, which is a good sign!
The wording is perplexing, but seems that it struggles to explain to me that passing <code>[&#34;ls&#34;, &#34;&gt;&#34;, &#34;out.txt&#34;]</code> won’t actually redirect, because <code>&gt;</code> will get quoted.
This is exactly what I want!
The absence of any kind of a security note on both APIs is concerning, but oh well.</p>
<p>So, I refactored the code to use this second constructor, and, 🥁 🥁 🥁, it still had the exact same behavior!
Turns out that this API takes an array of arguments, and just concatenates them, unless I explicitly say that each argument needs to be escaped.</p>
<p>And <em>this</em> is what I am complaining about — that the API looks like it is safe for an untrusted user input, while it is not.
This is misuse resistance resistance.</p>
<p>That’s all, thanks for reading!</p>

      <title>Increase HTTP performance by fitting in the initial TCP slow start window</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
<p>
This is an edition of the <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin/">Napkin Math newsletter</a>,
a newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to
estimate the performance of systems.

<p>Did you know that if your site’s under ~12kb the first page will load
significantly faster? Servers only send a few packets (typically 10)
in the initial round-trip while TCP is warming up (referred to as TCP slow
start). After sending the first set of packets, it needs to wait for
the client to acknowledge it received all those packets.</p>
<p>Quick illustration of transferring ~15kb with an initial TCP slow start window
(also referred to as initial congestion window or <code>initcwnd</code>) of 10 versus 30:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The larger the initial window, the more we can transfer in the first roundtrip,
the faster your site is on the initial page load. For a large roundtrip time
(e.g. across an ocean), this will start to matter a lot. Here is the approximate
size of the initial window for a number of common hosting providers:</p>

<p>To generate this, I wrote a script that you can use <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/initcwnd"><code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code></a> to
analyze your own site. Based on the report, you can attempt to tune your page
size, or tune your server’s initial slow start window size (<code>initcwnd</code>) (see
bottom of article). Read on, and we’ll go into far more detail!</p>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p>Dear Napkin Mathers, it’s been too long. Since last, I’ve left Shopify after 8
amazing years. Ride of a lifetime. For the time being, I’m passing the time with
standup paddleboarding (did a 125K 3-day trip the week after I left),
recreational programming (of which napkin math surely is a part), and learning
some non-computer things.</p>
<p>In this issue, we’ll dig into the details of exactly what happens on the wire
when we do the initial page load of a website over HTTP. As I’ve already hinted
at, we’ll show that there’s a magical byte threshold to be aware of when
optimizing for short-lived, bursty TCP transfers. If you’re under this threshold,
or increase it, it’ll potentially save the client from several roundtrips.
Especially for sites with a single location that are often requested from far
away (i.e. high roundtrip times), e.g. US -&gt; Australia, this can make a <em>huge</em>
difference. That’s likely the situation you’re in if you’re operating a
SaaS-style service. While we’ll focus on HTTP over the public internet, TCP slow
start can also matter to RPC inside of your data-centre, and especially across
them.</p>
<p>As always, we’ll start by laying out our naive mental model about how we <em>think</em>
loading a site works at layer 4. Then we’ll do the napkin math on expected
performance, and confront our fragile, naive model with reality to see if it
lines up.</p>
<p>So what do we think happens at the TCP-level when we request a site? For
simplicity, we will exclude compression, DOM rendering, Javascript, etc., and
limit ourselves exclusively to downloading the HTML. In other words: <code>curl --http1.1 https://sirupsen.com &gt; /dev/null</code> (note that <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/initcwnd"><code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code></a>
uses <code>--compressed</code> with <code>curl</code> to reflect reality).</p>
<p>We’d expect something alone the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 DNS roundtrip (we’ll ignore this one, typically cached close by)</li>
<li>1 TCP roundtrip to establish the connection (<code>SYN</code> and <code>SYN+ACK</code>)</li>
<li>2 TLS roundtrips to negotiate a <em>secure</em> connection</li>
<li>1 HTTP roundtrip to request the page and the server sending it</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To make things a little more interesting, we’ll choose a site that is
geographically further from me that isn’t overly optimized: <code>information.dk</code>, a
Danish newspaper. Through some DNS lookups from servers in different geographies
and by using <a href="https://bgp.he.net/ip/109.238.50.144">a looking glass</a>, I can determine that all their HTML traffic
is always routed to a datacenter in Copenhagen. These days, many sites are
routed through e.g. Cloudflare POPs which will have a nearby data-centre, to
simplify our analysis, we want to make sure that’s not the case.</p>
<p>I’m currently sitting in South-Western Quebec on an LTE connection. I can
determine <a href="https://cln.sh/5Br6AV">through <code>traceroute(1)</code></a> that my traffic is travelling to
Copenhagen through the path Montreal -&gt; New York -&gt; Amsterdam -&gt; Copenhagen.
<a href="https://cln.sh/CFgnEZ">Round-trip time is ~140ms</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we add up the number of round-trips from our napkin model above (excluding
DNS), we’d expect loading the Danish site would take us <code>4 * 140ms = 560ms</code>.
Since I’m on an LTE connection where I’m not getting much above 15 mbit/s, we
have to factor in that it takes another <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=160kb+at+15+mbit%2Fs">~100ms to transfer the data</a>,
in addition to the 4 round-trips. So with our napkin math, we’re expecting that
we should be able to download the 160kb of HTML from a server in Copenhagen
within a ballpark of <code>~660ms</code>.</p>
<p>Reality, however, has other plans. When I run time <code>curl --http1.1 https://www.information.dk</code> it takes 1.3s! Normally we say that if the napkin
math is within ~10x, the napkin math is likely in line with reality, but
that’s typically when we deal with nano and microseconds. Not off by
~<code>640ms</code>!</p>
<p>So what’s going on here? When there’s a discrepancy between the napkin math and
reality, it’s because either (1) the napkin model of the world is incorrect, or
(2) there’s room for optimization in the system. In this case, it’s a bit of
both. Let’s hunt down those 640ms. 👀</p>
<p>To do that, we have to analyze the raw network traffic with Wireshark. Wireshark
brings back many memories.. some fond, but mostly… frustration trying to
figure out causes of intermittent network problems. In this case, for once it’s
for fun and games! We’ll type <code>host www.information.dk</code> into Wireshark to make
it capture traffic to the site. In our terminal we run the <code>curl</code> command above
for Wireshark to have something to capture.</p>
<p>Wireshark will then give us a nice GUI to help us hunt down the roughly half a
second we haven’t accounted for. One thing to note is that in order to get
Wireshark to understand the TLS/SSL contents of the session it needs to know the
secret negotiated with the server. There’s a complete guide <a href="https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/tls/sslkeylogfile">here</a>, but
in short you pass <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE=log.log</code> to your <code>curl</code> command and then point
to that file in Wireshark in the TLS configuration.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-3-tls-roundtrips-rather-than-2">Problem 1: 3 TLS roundtrips rather than 2</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We see the TCP roundtrip as expected, <code>SYN</code> from the client, then <code>SYN+ACK</code> from
the server. Bueno. But after that it looks fishy. We’re seeing <em>3</em> round-trips
for TLS/SSL instead of the expected 2 from our drawing above!</p>
<p></p>
<p>To make sure I wasn’t misunderstanding something, I double-checked with
<code>sirupsen.com</code>, and sure enough, it’s showing the two roundtrips in Wireshark as
anticipated:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we carefully study the annotated Wireshark dump above for the Danish
newspaper, we can see that the problem is that for whatever reason the server is
waiting for a TCP ack in the middle of transmitting the certificate (packet 9).</p>
<p>To make it a easier to parse, the exchange looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why is the server waiting for a TCP ACK from the client after transmitting ~4398
bytes of the certificate? Why doesn’t the server just send the whole certificate
at once?</p>
<h2 id="bytes-in-flight-or-the-initial-congestion-window">Bytes in flight or the “initial congestion window”</h2>
<p>In TCP, the server carefully monitors how many packets/bytes it has in flight.
Typically, each packet is ~1460 bytes of application data. The server doesn’t
necessarily send <em>all</em> the data it has at once, because the server doesn’t know
how “fat” the pipes are to the client. If the client can only receive 64 kbit/s
currently, then sending e.g. 100 packets could completely clog the network. The
network most likely will drop some random packets which would be even slower to
compensate from than sending the packets at a more sustainable pace for the
client.</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> part of the TCP protocol is the balancing act of trying to send as
much data as possible at any given time, while ensuring the server doesn’t
over-saturate the path to the client and lose packets. Losing packets is very
bad for bandwidth in TCP.</p>
<p>The server only keeps a certain amount of packets in flight at any given time.
“In flight” in TCP terms means “unacknowledged” packets, i.e. packets of data
the server has sent to the client that the client hasn’t yet sent an
acknowledgement to the server that it has received. Typically for every
successfully acknowledged packet the server’s TCP implementation will decide to
increase the number of allowed in-flight packets by 1. You may have heard this
simple algorithm referred to as “TCP slow start.” On the flip-side, if a packet
has been dropped then the server will decide to have slightly less bytes in
flight. Throughout the existence of the TCP connection’s lifetime this dance
will be tirelessly performed. In TCP terms what we’ve called “in-flight” is
referred to as the “congestion window” (or <code>cwnd</code> in short-form).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Typically after the first packet has been lost the TCP implementation switches
from the simple TCP slow start algorithm to a more complicated <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/TCP_Slow-Start_and_Congestion_Avoidance.svg">“Congestion
Control Algorithm”</a> of which there are dozens. Their job is: Based on what
we’ve observed about the network, how much should we have in flight to maximize
bandwidth?</p>
<p>Now we can go back and understand why the TLS handshake is taking 3 roundtrips
instead of 2. After the client’s starts the TLS handshake with <code>TLS HELLO</code>, the
Danish server really, really wants to transfer this ~6908 byte certificate.
Unfortunately though the server’s congestion window (packets in flight allowed) at
the time just isn’t large enough to accommodate the whole certificate!</p>
<p>Put another way, the server’s TCP implementation has decided it’s <em>not</em>
confident the poor client can receive that many tasty bytes all at once yet –
so it sends a petty 4398 bytes of the certificate. Of course, 63% of a
certificate isn’t enough to move on with the TLS handshake… so the client
sighs, sends a TCP ACK back to the server, which then sends the meager 2510 left
of the certificate so the client can move on to perform its part of the TLS
handshake.</p>
<p>Of course, this all seems a little silly… first of all, why is the certificate
6908 bytes?! For comparison, it’s 2635 for my site. Although that’s not too
interesting to me. What’s more interesting is why is the server only sending
6908 bytes? That seems scanty for a modern web server!</p>
<p>In TCP how many packets we can send on a brand new connection before we know
<em>anything</em> about the client is called the “initial congestion window.” In a
configuration context, this is called <code>initcwnd</code>. If you reference the yellow
graph above with the packets in flight, that’s the value at the first roundtrip.</p>
<p>These days, the default for a Linux server is 10 packets, or <code>10 * 1460 = 14600 bytes</code>, where 1460 is roughly the data payload of each packet. That would’ve fit
that monster certificate of the Danish newspaper. Clearly that’s not their
<code>initcwd</code> since then the server wouldn’t have patiently waited for my ACK.
Through some digging it appears that prior to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/optimizing-the-linux-stack-for-mobile-web-per/">Linux 3.0.0 <code>initcwnd</code> was
3</a>, or ~<code>3 * 1460 = 4380</code> bytes! That approximately lines up, so it seems
that the Danish newspaper’s <code>initcwnd</code> is 3. We don’t know for sure it’s Linux,
but we know the <code>initcwnd</code> is 3.</p>
<p>Because of the exponential growth of the packets in flight, <code>initcwnd</code> matters
quite a bit for how much data we can send in those first few precious
roundtrips:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we saw in the intro, it’s common among CDNs to raise the values from the
default to e.g. 32 (~46kb). This makes sense, as you might be transmitting
images of many megabytes. Waiting for TCP slow start to get to this point can
take a few roundtrips.</p>
<p>Another other reasons, this is also why HTTP2/HTTP3 moved in the direction of
moving more data through the same connection as it has an already “warm” TCP
session. “Warm” meaning that the congestion window / bytes in flight has already
been increased generously from the initial by the server.</p>
<p>The TCP slow start window is also part of why points of presence (POPs) are
useful. If you connect to a POP in front of your website that’s 10ms
away, negotiate TLS with the POP, and the POP already has a warm connection
with the backend server 100ms away – this improves performance dramatically,
with no other changes. From <code>4 * 100ms = 400ms</code> to <code>3 * 10ms + 100ms = 130ms</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-roundtrips-for-the-http-payload">How many roundtrips for the HTTP payload?</h2>
<p>Now we’ve gotten to the bottom of why we have 3 TLS roundtrips rather than the
expected 2: the initial congestion window is small. The congestion window
(allowed bytes in flight by the server) applies equally to the HTTP payload
that the server sends back to us. If it doesn’t fit inside the congestion
window, then we need multiple round-trips to receive all the HTML.</p>
<p>In Wireshark, we can pull up a TCP view that’ll give us an idea of how many
roundtrips was required to complete the request (<a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/initcwnd"><code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code></a> tries to
guess this for you with an embarrassingly simple algorithm):</p>
<p></p>
<p>We see the TCP roundtrip, 3 TLS roundtrips, and then 5-6 HTTP roundtrips to get
the ~160kb page! Each little dot in the picture shows a packet, so you’ll notice
that the congestion window (allowed bytes in flight) is roughly doubling every
roundtrip. The server is increasing the size of the window for every successful
roundtrip. A ‘successful roundtrip’ means a roundtrip that didn’t drop packets, and
in some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/tcp-bbr-congestion-control-comes-to-gcp-your-internet-just-got-faster">newer algorithms</a>, a roundtrip that didn’t take too much time.</p>
<p>Typically, the server will continue to double the number of packets (~1460 bytes each) for each successful roundtrip until either an unsuccessful roundtrip happens (slow or dropped packets), <em>or</em> the bytes in flight would exceed the <em>client’s</em> receive window.</p>
<p>When a TCP session starts, the client will advertise how many bytes <em>it</em> allows in flight. This typically is much larger than the server is wiling to send off the bat. We can pull this up in the initial <code>SYN</code> package from the client and see that it’s ~65kb:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the session had been much longer and we pushed up against that window, the client would’ve sent a TCP package updating the size of the receive window. So there’s two windows at play: the server manages the number of packets in flight: the <em>congestion window</em>. The congestion window is controlled by the server’s <em>congestion algorithm</em> which is adjusted based on the number of successful roundtrips, but always capped by the client’s <em>receive window</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the amount of packets transmitted by the server in each roundtrip:</p>
<ul>
<li>TLS roundtrip: 3 packets (~4kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 1: 6 (~8kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 2: 10 (~14kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 3: 17 (~24kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 4: 29 (~41kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 5: 48 (~69kb, this in theory would have exceeded the 64kb current
receive window since the client didn’t enlarge it for some reason. The server
only transmitted ~64kb)</li>
<li>HTTP roundtrip 6: 9 (12kb, just the remainder of the data)</li>
</ul>
<p>The growth of the congestion window is a <em>textbook</em> cubic function, it has a
<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cubic+fit+3%2C+6%2C+10%2C+17%2C+29%2C+48">perfect fit</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure why it follows a cubic function. I expected TCP slow start
to just double every roundtrip. 🤷 As far as I can gather, on modern TCP
implementation the congestion window is doubled every roundtrip until a packet
is lost (as is the case for most other sites I’ve analyzed, e.g. the session in
the screenshot below). After <em>that</em> we might move to a cubic growth. This
might’ve changed later on? It’s completely up to the TCP implementation.</p>
<p>This is part of why I wrote <code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code> to spit out the size of the
windows, so you don’t have to do any math or guesswork, here for a Github repo
(uncompressed):</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="consolidating-our-new-model-with-the-napkin-math">Consolidating our new model with the napkin math</h2>
<p>So now we can explain the discrepancy between our simplistic napkin math model
and reality. We assumed 2 TLS roundtrips, but in fact there was 3, because of
the low initial congestion window by the server. We also assumed 1 HTTP
roundtrip, but in fact there was 6, because the server’s congestion window and
client’s receive window didn’t allow sending everything at once. This brings our
total roundtrips to <code>1 + 3 + 6 = 10</code> roundtrips. With our roundtrip time at
130ms, this lines up perfectly with the 1.3s total time we observed at the top
of the post! This suggests our new, updated mental model of the system reflects
reality well.</p>
<h2 id="ok-cool-but-how-do-i-make-my-own-website-faster">Ok cool but how do I make my own website faster?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve analyzed this website together, you can use this to analyze your
own website and optimize it. You can do this by running
<a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/initcwnd"><code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code></a> against your website. It uses some very simple
heuristics to guess the windows and their size. They don’t work always,
especially not if you’re on a slow connection or the website streams the
response back to the client, rather than sending it all at once.</p>
<p>Another thing to be aware of is that the Linux kernel (and likely other kernels)
caches the congestion window size (among other things) with clients via the
route cache. This is great, because it means that we don’t have to renegotiate
it from scratch when a client reconnects. But it might mean that subsequent runs
against the same website will give you a far larger <code>initcwnd</code>. The lowest you
encounter will be the right one. Note also that a site might have a fleet with
servers that have different <code>initcwnd</code> values!</p>
<p>The output of <code>sirupsen/initcwnd</code> will be something like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here we can see the size of the TCP windows. The initial window was 10 packets
for Github.com, and then doubles every roundtrip. The last window isn’t a full
80 packets, because there wasn’t enough bytes left from the server.</p>
<p>With this result, we could decide to change the <code>initcwnd</code> to a higher value to
try to send it back in fewer roundtrips. This might, however, have drawbacks
for clients on slower connections and should be done with care. It does show
some promise that CDNs have values in the 30s. Unfortunately I don’t have access
to enough traffic to see for myself to study this, as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-initcwnd">Google did</a> when
they championed the change from a default of 3 to 10. That document also
explains potential drawbacks in more detail.</p>
<p>The most practical day-to-day takeaway might be that e.g. base64 inlining images
and CSS may come with serious drawbacks if it throws your site over a congestion
window threshold.</p>
<p>You can change <code>initcwnd</code> with the <code>ip(1)</code> command on Linux, from here to the
default 10 to 32:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">simon@netherlands:~$ ip route show
default via 10.164.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.164.0.2 metric <span>100</span>
10.164.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp scope link src 10.164.0.2 metric <span>100</span>

simon@netherlands:~$ sudo ip route change default via 10.164.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.164.0.2 metric <span>100</span> initcwnd <span>32</span> initrwnd <span>32</span>

simon@netherlands:~$ ip route show
default via 10.164.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.164.0.2 metric <span>100</span> initcwnd <span>32</span> initrwnd <span>32</span>
10.164.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp scope link src 10.164.0.2 metric <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Another key TCP setting it’s worth tuning for TCP is
<code>tcp_slow_start_after_idle</code>. It’s a good name: by default when set to 1, it’ll
renegotiate the congestion window after a few seconds of no activity (while you
read on the site). You probably want to set this to 0 in
<code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_slow_start_after_idle</code> so it remembers the congestion
window for the next page load.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <span> 4:30 pm, 10 Jun 2021</span>

        <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I found some quirky software from the dotcom boom and restored it to working order. I&#39;d love to tell you the story of how I got here if you stick around, but if you&#39;re more interested in a more direct description, you can head <a href="https://archive.org/details/pinkrabbit">straight to the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<h3>Part 1: Discovering DreamFlyer</h3>
<p>Ever since I got a Dreamcast, I&#39;ve wound up collecting some of the internet and multimedia software it was home to in its lifetime. I really enjoy the colourful and creative interfaces of its various web browsers, and find the ambitions of <a href="https://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2017/11/dream-library-dreamcast-foreunner-to.html">their foray into downloadable content on 33.6kbps modems</a> fascinating.</p>
<p>In 2019 I happened to be shopping for games on eBay and found a copy of <a href="https://segaretro.org/DreamFlyer">DreamFlyer</a> for US$1. I knew very little about it, and the internet seemed to know about as much. Figuring it was something intriguing to add to the collection I picked it up.</p>
<p>I&#39;d dabbled in getting my Dreamcast set up to send emails before, adapting <a href="https://dreamcastlive.net/sega-swirl-guide/">Dreamcast Live&#39;s instructions</a> to something that suited my email host and felt a bit better, running a mail relay on the DreamPi which would retrieve emails from a folder within my regular email hosting. It worked fine with Dreamcast web browsers&#39; email clients, and it was fun to play around and discover that email has changed a lot in the past 20 years, but once DreamFlyer arrived I couldn&#39;t coax it into sending an email. I figured either it required a long-dead server, or just wasn&#39;t happy. I think I basically just forgot about DreamFlyer for a while.</p>
<p>For my birthday in 2021 a friend sent me a Sega-themed happy birthday, and my mind immediately went back to DreamFlyer. I decided I was going to reply with something composed in DreamFlyer. After all, even if emailing wouldn&#39;t be useful in 2021 I could screen capture it and send that. I spent a few minutes composing the flyer, covering it in all manner of stamps, took a screenshot and replied. And then I wondered, what if I tried emailing it again?</p>
<center><a href="https://jessicastokes.net/img/posts/2021-06-10-unlocking-pinkrabbit/dreamflyer-card.png"></a></center>
<p>So I put in my own email address and hit send. I waited as it dialled up to my LAN, and then with a quick fanfare I got a message box. It didn&#39;t look like the error message I&#39;d seen the last time. It had actually sent!</p>
<p>Jumping over to my phone, I refreshed my inbox, and sure enough, there was my email, with a &#34;tml&#34; attachment and this footer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>【添付データについて】</p>
<p>●Windows95/98もしくはMacintoshをお使いの場合、以下のホームページから表示ソフト（無料）をダウンロードしてご覧ください。</p>
<p>※お問い合わせ先：</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it&#39;s saying that the attachment was composed using DreamFlyer, which is email software for the Dreamcast. Free viewer software for Windows and Macintosh is available from that URL, and if you need more information, you can contact SEGA Enterprises. Neat! I checked the attachment with a hex editor and it didn&#39;t have any recognisable format I could decipher.</p>
<p>At this point I wanted to see my computer view the email, so I tried browsing that site. Naturally, it&#39;s no longer on the live web, so I turned to the Internet Archive&#39;s Wayback Machine. To my surprise, the executable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040812023304if_/http://www.isao.net/dreamflyer/dl/index.html">had made it into a crawl</a>. I managed to set it up in CrossOver with <code>LC_ALL</code> overridden to <code>ja-JP</code>. Cool! I fired it up, and was greeted with an error message complaining that the program had expired, and that I should download an updated version. Uh-oh!</p>
<h3>Part 2: Unlocking DreamFlyer</h3>
<p>This was a setback, but I fired up a VM with a copy of Ghidra. It&#39;s not the best, but it&#39;s the disassembler which has given me the best results for free so far. I spent a few hours tracing back from calls to <code>GetLocalTime</code>, but ultimately yeilded nothing clear-cut. I&#39;d later learn that Ghidra didn&#39;t really know how to recognise any symbols in this binary.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to try searching for string data, to see if I could find the strings related to the error message and work from there. I tried the <code>strings</code> utility, but the one provided with macOS doesn&#39;t have support for anything but ASCII text by default, and I was pretty sure I&#39;d need Shift JIS support. Eventually I tried the same thing in Ghidra, and after scrolling through the list of strings, at the bottom I struck gold.</p>
<p>There, at <code>0x8a71a</code>, was the UTF-16 string <code>2001/8/1</code>. I checked the Readme, and indeed, it stated that the program would expire after July 31, 2001. Surely, I thought to myself, this was for informational purposes, or otherwise just a display string, but I edited it to a far-future date, fired up DreamFlyer, and it worked! I was able to view the email I had actually composed and sent from my Dreamcast.</p>
<center><a href="https://jessicastokes.net/img/posts/2021-06-10-unlocking-pinkrabbit/dreamflyer-pc.png"></a></center>
<p>At this point, I wondered about the Macintosh version the footer had mentioned - I have a lovely PowerBook G4 Titanium, and it&#39;d be neat to send emails from the Dreamcast to it, so I scoured each revision of the DreamFlyer for PC site. Sadly, despite references to it on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001004190821if_/http://www.dricas.com:80/dfhour/viewer/download.html">at least one page</a>, I only managed to find that copy of the Windows version on ISAO.net, all the way until the site changed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011223032513if_/http://www.isao.net/dreamflyer/">in 2001 to say it was no longer available</a>.</p>
<p>That message, though, mentioned that users could move to a program called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020611053551if_/http://prabbit.colabo.co.jp/index.html">PinkRabbit</a>, and import their messages from DreamFlyer, guiding users to move their &#34;tml&#34; files into PinkRabbit&#39;s &#34;mailbox&#34; folder. My curiosity was piqued, it looked like DreamFlyer was actually part of a much larger ecosystem! Indeed, peeking into the readme files supplied with DreamFlyer for PC revealed that PinkRabbit was an entire family of multimedia email software, including PinkRabbit-branded software for Windows and Macintosh, as well as FINAL FANTASY VIII Mail for Windows, Trihoo Mail for Windows, Kumomail for Windows and Macintosh, and several others.</p>
<p>With this discovered, I collated this information as well as copies of DreamFlyer&#39;s original installer and my patched executable, onto <a href="https://archive.org/details/dflyerpc">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<h3>Part 3: Tracking down PinkRabbit</h3>
<p>With that put aside, I was intrigued by this broader family of applications. There was very little about it on the internet, and even scouring the Wayback Machine for any hints on their website came up empty.</p>
<p>I tried searching more broadly for PinkRabbit, and after trimming down a lot of unrelated search result, stumbled upon the book <a href="https://www.kinokuniya.co.jp/f/dsg-01-9784883990641">「PinkRabbitで作る　かわいい　メール」</a> (&#34;Cute email made with PinkRabbit&#34;) by Takamatsu Yoshiaki (ISBN4-88399-064-8, published by Subarusya). This book originally came with a CD-ROM containing copies of two variants of PinkRabbit: <em>Classic</em> and <em>CUTiE</em>. My wife and I were already looking to import something from Japan, and I found a copy on Yahoo Auctions for ¥350. The listing wasn&#39;t clear on whether the CD-ROM was included, but for so little I thought I had to try it out. Bare minimum we&#39;d get a decent quality scan of the cover onto the internet for the first time.</p>
<p>Further reading of PinkRabbit&#39;s website revealed that although the Macintosh version had not launched at the same time as the Windows version, it had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990427105622if_/http://prabbit.colabo.co.jp/pub/mactop/index.html">available since early 1999</a>. This made the missing Macintosh version of DreamFlyer all the more curious given <a href="https://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/142000109">the Dreamcast version launched in December 1999</a>.</p>
<h3>Part 4: Unlocking PinkRabbit</h3>
<p>It took a few weeks for the order to filter through local post and then out to international, but eventually I found the book in my hands. I gently flexed it experimentally, and it felt like there was a CD in there! Sure enough, flipping to the back page, there it was in all its pink glory.</p>
<center><a href="https://jessicastokes.net/img/posts/2021-06-10-unlocking-pinkrabbit/pinkrabbit-de-tsukuru-kawaii-mail@2x.jpg"></a></center>
<p>I perused the book a bit with the help of some OCR translations. Along with a full colour section which gives screenshots of the included stationery and stamps, it revealed a little more about the original functionality. It was available for free via signing up for an online account, and had a companion online service which provided additional stamps, postage stamps and stationery for download. There was also the option to create your own sticker or stamp. Neat! Just like DreamFlyer, it had no vendor lock-in; you could point it at your own email servers just fine. The TransMediaLetter file format was the only proprietary bit of the chain.</p>
<p>Classic and CUTiE were also revealed to be two variants of the program, which didn&#39;t diverge that much at all; the difference coming down to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006131356if_/http://prabbit.colabo.co.jp/pub/info/pinkra/family2.html">theming, graphics, and included stationery and stamps</a>. Classic is a bit more neutral, but still pretty cute, while CUTiE goes all-in on the candy colouring.</p>
<p>Firing up a Windows 2000 machine with the Japanese locale installed, I popped in the CD. It AutoPlayed a web page, providing a choice of Classic or CUTiE, as well as a catalogue of the additional stationery included on the CD.</p>
<p>I got the program installed, fired it up, and was unsurprised to see the same expiry message as DreamFlyer. I wasn&#39;t sure if they would, but I guess it made sense that they&#39;d have expiry on their own versions as well. With the knowledge I had from DreamFlyer it didn&#39;t take long for me to find a similar expiry date in the <code>srabbit.exe</code> executable, at <code>0x900fa</code>. This limited use of this version to the end of 2003. I did the same as I had on DreamFlyer, opened it up again and... was greeted with the same expiry message! I checked and re-checked my work, tried changing the date in the other <code>prabbit.exe</code> executable, but no amount of fiddling with the dates got it working. Odd!</p>
<p>Looking at the supplied readme, I quickly learned that in addition to the quoted expiry date of the 31st of December 2003, it additionally included a 31-day trial timer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>使用期限はインストール後31日です。2003年12月31日以降はご使用になれません。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suggested that the user could simply register for an account and download an updated version whenever that happened. Unfortunately, that registration system was long gone at this stage, and this requirement had all but guaranteed that no copies had survived.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn&#39;t going to stop me completely. DreamFlyer already worked, and it was clearly very similar code, if not the same, so I&#39;d come back later. I instead turned my attention to the Macintosh version. Firing up the CD on my PowerBook G4 Titanium revealed a pair of StuffIt Self-Extracting Archives for installers, and a similar HTML catalogue to the Windows version.</p>
<p>I got it installed, and fired it up. Sure enough, despite the Apple Platinum window borders, it had the same restrictions as the Windows version, and had long since expired. I discovered fairly quickly that the Macintosh version also had the expiry date within the application&#39;s data fork, this time as an ASCII string rather than UTF-16. Curiously, changing this string to a far-future date unlocked the application&#39;s functionality.</p>
<p>At this point I was a bit puzzled, and finding myself a bit out of my depth in reverse-engineering the Windows application, I put the call out online for help. In the meantime, I checked the other version, and it turned out that both variants had identical executables across both platforms, which would make it a bit simpler to patch!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_Ninji">Ninji</a> was kind enough to answer the call. Sending my notes along with copies of the Windows installers, he set about reverse engineering the expiry error. Along the way we discovered some curiosities, like a mysterious debug mode activated by the mere presence of a <code>debmode.ini</code> file alongside the executable, which seemed to connect to a long-offline FTP server at <code>ftp.gao.co.jp</code>.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t take long for Ninji to find the routines responsible. It turned out to be storing a file in <code>%WINDIR%</code> called <code>SRABBIT.001</code>, and using the creation date of this file to control the expiry. Additionally, the code to handle this would add 32,400 seconds (or 9 hours) to the file&#39;s creation time in an apparent attempt to implement the Japanese Standard Time time zone. This instead meant that in other time zones the trial period on Windows wouldn&#39;t actually start for a few hours after installation. Sure enough, adjusting the creation time of the file by a few hours unlocked the application. Fantastic, waylaid on Windows by a late-90s time zone bug. 😂</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn&#39;t a permanent fix; the 31-day trial still applied, it just meant it could be worked around. Further investigation eventually revealed the routines responsible for this were retrieving information from another UTF-16 string in the executable. This one was the string <code>SRABBIT.001,31</code> at <code>0x90182</code>. It turned out to indicate the file name, as well as the duration of the trial period in days.</p>
<p>Luckily for our purposes, the programmers had written a null check into this routine, meaning that changing this to represent an empty string (by changing the first byte to a null byte) stopped the program from creating or checking the creation date of the <code>SRABBIT.001</code> file, and behaving like it wasn&#39;t a trial version at all! The Windows lockout was defeated!</p>
<center><a href="https://jessicastokes.net/img/posts/2021-06-10-unlocking-pinkrabbit/pinkrabbit-classic-win.png"></a></center>
<p>With this knowledge I turned back to the Macintosh version, fired up Sherlock, and searched for &#34;SRABBIT&#34;. Pretty soon I was pointed into the <code>tmailbmp</code> folder alongside the application. There was our trial control file. It seemed fairly likely that these were using the same code, then! I popped the application into <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/hexedit">HexEdit</a> and found that <code>SRABBIT.001,31</code> string was also present in the data fork, at <code>0xefd1f</code>. Given the Macintosh&#39;s history as a Pascal-first system, this didn&#39;t appear to be a null-terminated string, which made me worry it might require more complicated patching. I also couldn&#39;t find a Pascal-style length indicator, and changing the byte before merely broke the executable, but it turned out that a null byte worked just fine! Both versions were unlocked. 🎉</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>With all that done, Misty submitted the PinkRabbit CD-ROM to Redump, and put <a href="https://archive.org/details/pink_rabbit_de_tsukuru_kawaii_mail">a copy on the Internet Archive</a>. I additionally contributed <a href="https://archive.org/details/pinkrabbit">extracted and patched copies</a> much like I had with <a href="https://archive.org/details/dflyerpc">DreamFlyer</a>. And now both are there for anyone to play around with again.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun digging into this artefact of the 90s where cuteness was the prime directive. I really wish more software was focused on being cute, computers would be a lot more interesting if they did.</p>
<h3>Appendix: Novelties</h3>
<p>Given the executables are the identical, PinkRabbit just looks for resource files in the directory it&#39;s stored in. This means if you were to copy the <code>tmailbmp</code> folder from DreamFlyer for Windows into PinkRabbit for Macintosh, PinkRabbit for Macintosh can become DreamFlyer for Macintosh! This makes the fact that Sega&#39;s variant seemingly never got its promised Macintosh release all the more puzzling.</p>

<p>OnlyFans has become part of the zeitgeist recently.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/1/20748707/egirl-definition-what-is-an-eboy">rise of e-girls</a> and the <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">prospects of making millions</a> make it a fun thing to gawk at in a reality-tv kind of way. It has benefitted fabulously from the pandemic too. With everyone stuck at home all day, less of us have jobs and we all have less to entertain ourselves with. More existential boredom equals more<span></span> <span>“</span>fans” and<span></span> <span>“</span>creators” alike.</p>
<p>I was curious about this <a href="https://www.complex.com/life/2020/03/onlyfans-trending-on-twitter-weird-specific-interests">trending</a> yet mysterious company, and wanted to find out more.</p>
<p>Despite dipping its toe in the mainstream, there wasn’t much about OnlyFans in the news. There are many interviews with OnlyFans creators, but I wanted some hard data.</p>
<p>To get it, I scraped the Onlyfans website and did some analysis. The results are presented below for your pleasure. At the very bottom, I explain how I got them.</p>
<p>To start I go through OnlyFans as a business, explaining why I think it is a unicorn in disguise. Next, we’ll look at how OnlyFans is more unequal than the least equal country in the world. Finally, I’ll return to the question I began this essay with. Should you make an OnlyFans account?</p>
<h2 id="onlyfans-is-a-billion-dollar-business">OnlyFans is a billion dollar business</h2>
<p>Sex has always sold well. Now OnlyFans use the leverage of software to multiply its profits, giving power to the performers along the way.</p>
<p>Their business is as simple as it gets. They provide a platform for paywalled content. Creators, mostly fitness models and amateur pornstars, post exclusive content, to which only their paying<span></span> <span>“</span>fans” have access. OnlyFans takes a 20% cut, one giant pimp in the middle of an online marketplace of punters and showgirls.</p>
<p>It’s the Uber-isation of wanking; the logical conclusion to <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">markets eating the world</a>. Instead of monetising a spare room or a Prius you monetise your selfies.</p>
<p>While Uber and Airbnb disrupted taxi-companies and hotel chains, OnlyFans are disrupting a seedier incumbent — the porn industry. Big Porn is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girls_Wanted">notorious</a> for taking advantage of young women. Via their commission-based model, OnlyFans pays the performers their share, giving power back to the pornstars.</p>
<p>OnlyFans is actually an even better business model than Airbnb or Uber. As the owner of a rental property, or a gig taxi driver, I can only cater to one group of people at any one time. But as an OnlyFans creator, I can broadcast content to the multitude all at once. Making money on Airbnb or Uber is linear — I always have to do one more ride, or host one more visit. On OnlyFans it’s multiplicative — the same selfie can serve 10 adoring fans or 1000.</p>
<p>If you have minimal shame, a drooling audience and are willing to get your togs off its a pretty sweet deal: Creators can make millions of dollars a year just posting photos and videos.</p>
<p>Since they take a share of their revenues, what is good for creators is good for OnlyFans themselves. And by the looks of recent trends, business has been very good indeed.</p>
<p>OnlyFans have benefited massively from the coronavirus crisis. Search activity has doubled since the lockdown, and according to Alexa, their traffic has surged.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Source: Google Trends</em></p>
<p>Even before the pandemic they were growing rapidly. They paid <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10354575/filing-history">£641k corporation tax in 2018</a>, which at an effective tax rate of 15% implies 2018 revenues of around £4m, or $5.5m. Today in 2020, their top users alone make this much money through their site.</p>
<p>With a couple of assumptions, it’s easy to estimate their yearly revenue today. And oh god is it big.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">they had over 60,000 content creators and 7m registered users</a>. Extrapolating from the Google growth trends, it’s safe to say they have at least 10m users today. I calculated the average revenue per creator per month (about $250) and the average subscription fee (about $8.7) from my scraped data. Applying the 20% commission and assuming only half the users and creators are active, we end up with a lower bound of $90m, and an upper bound of $104m.</p>
<p>That’s an annual growth rate of between 304% and 334%. Absolute nuts.</p>
<p>But how much are they worth? According to this article, OnlyFans takes home 60% of their revenue net of processing and fees. This means they make profits between $54m and $62m. Since the business really doesn’t have to do anything besides host the platform, collect fees, and store content securely, its probably worthy of an <span>EBIT</span> multiple of around 15x. This gives a total valuation of between $810m and $936m.</p>
<p>Who knew you could make so much money hosting nudes? The crazy thing is that this valuation is probably still too low. The estimate of the number of users is likely too conservative — <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">The Economist has it at 12m</a>. Also, it doesn’t take into account their recent surge in traffic, nor the likely sustained increase in traffic due to social distancing (See if you can work out why).</p>
<p>There are risks too. In any business that sells exclusivity, security is paramount. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884dgx/onlyfans-leak-isnt-anything-new">Apparently</a> there was a big leak in February, but the company denies this.</p>
<p>Risks aside, OnlyFans is a stunningly good business. But for a company which claims to democratise paid content, its amazing how unequal it is.</p>
<h2 id="almost-all-money-is-made-by-the-top-creators">Almost all money is made by the top creators</h2>
<p>This is a histogram of the monthly revenue per OnlyFans account from the set that I scraped. <a href="https://xsrus.com/writing/posts/power-laws-school">Remind you of anything</a>?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The revenue of content creators follows a classic power law distribution. The top accounts make something like $100,000 a month (these aren’t in my sample). The median account makes $180 a month.</p>
<p>The top 1% of accounts make 33% of all the money. The top 10% of accounts make 73% of all the money. This isn’t the 80:20 rule; it’s the 80:14 rule.</p>
<p>The standard way to measure inequality of an economy is with a Gini Index. An index of 0 implies a communist utopia, a value of 1 implies a single greedy capitalist owns all the wealth. The Gini index of OnlyFans is 0.83. The most unequal society in the world, South Africa, has a Gini index of 0.68. OnlyFans is less equal than an ex-apartheid state.</p>
<p>OnlyFans is so unequal because chancers make accounts with zero fans, while big Instagram stars take their following with them. A large proportion of accounts have no fans at all, and the lion’s share of fans are shared by the top accounts.</p>
<h2 id="most-creators-probably-lose-money">Most creators probably lose money</h2>
<p>Being an independent explicit online content creator is by <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">many</a> <a href="https://extra.ie/2020/02/15/news/real-life/onlyfans-risks-creators-sex-work">accounts</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/neagv8/only-fans-sex-worker-interview">exhausting</a>. Your<span></span> <span>“</span>fans” are not merely fans, they’re paying customers. To keep that sweet money flowing into their bank accounts, content creators often have to work harder and harder to satisfy their patrons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most accounts take home less than $145 per month (after commission). The modal revenue is $0.00, and the next most common is $4.99.</p>
<p>Creators put hours into each post, and on top of that, they interact one-on-one, with fans who can message them at any time. To break even on an OnlyFans account, creators need to earn more per month than the cost of hours spent engaging. The median take-home revenue is $136 per month. If you value a creator’s time at a $15 minimum wage, the median creator needs to be spending less than 9 hours per month on her OnlyFans to break even. This is less than 20 minutes a day.</p>
<p>Fans expect regular, prompt engagement, and many creators compare OnlyFans to running a business. It seems unlikely that you could satisfy all your fans demands in less time than it takes to make and eat breakfast.</p>
<p>Relative to effort, it looks like most accounts lose money.</p>
<p>For this reason, unless you already have a large following from somewhere like Instagram or Twitch, making an OnlyFans is unlikely to be worth the effort.</p>
<p>I’d invest my money in OnlyFans, but not my time. Sorry would-be fans, you’ll have to get your kicks elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="addendum-getting-the-tip">Addendum: Getting the tip</h3>
<p>One important thing this analysis of public data misses is tipping. A substantial proportion of the top accounts’ revenue comes from tips — money which fans send directly to creators for private messages or photos. Unfortunately, tipping amounts aren’t published by onlyfans so there’s a lot I don’t know about it.</p>
<p>I do know it can be very lucrative — some accounts request minimum hundreds of dollars per tip. Unlike posting public photos though, tipping doesn’t scale — you have to make every individual fan feel special. If you’re a large account and can charge hundreds per tip its easy money, but if you’re just starting out, tips make it harder, not easier, to attain a sustainable income because they require more work.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="how-i-did-it">How I did it</h2>
<p>First I emailed them to ask if I could see their aggregate level data. They sent me this reply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks Vlad. So I tried scraping their site instead.</p>
<p>I quickly learned that scraping OnlyFans is very difficult. This is not surprising — security is central to their business model. If you could scrape the images or videos off their platform, they wouldn’t have a business. I tried using Selenium and Beautiful Soup but neither one worked for me. So I used Sikuli instead.</p>
<p><a href="http://sikulix.com/">Sikuli</a> is a graphical user interface automation tool. It allows you to write scripts that mimic the behaviour of a real person — the computer physically moves the mouse to click on things, and types letters one by one into the search bar, just like you would. This means your script can<span></span> <span>“</span>trick” websites into thinking you’re a real person, so they won’t block you. A disadvantage of Sikuli is it requires your entire machine to function. Like an <span>AI</span> villain in a sci-fi movie, the computer literally takes control of your keyboard and mouse, so you can’t do anything while its running. It also takes much longer than a conventional web scraper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used a Chrome plugin to get leaf urls from the root OnlyFans site. Then I ran the Sikuli script a couple of times overnight with a <span>VPN</span> randomiser, so the site wouldn’t block my real <span>IP</span> address. OnlyFans have a Javascript waiting page which takes a randomised amount of time to load before you can see an account. Once the page loaded, my script manually saved down the full html file. Many times I loaded a url, only to find the account was unavailable — this is what happens when they block your <span>IP</span> address, which happened eventually despite the randomiser. After scraping around one thousand accounts I gave up and began processing.</p>
<h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>
<p>I processed the files using Beautiful Soup. I grabbed the number of likes, photos, videos, audios, the subscription price, and the last time the account was online. Most accounts didn’t have their number of fans publicly available, but if they did I grabbed that too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saved them down in a pandas data frame so I could easily analyse and visualise the data.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Because many accounts don’t have their number of fans available, I had to estimate it. I calculated the number of likes per post, and chose to use that as a proxy for number of fans. This is likely an underestimate; Jem Wolfe has over 12,000 fans, but this number isn’t publicly available on her page. In contrast, she only has 6920 likes per post. You can multiply the number of fans by the subscription price to get monthly revenue. Many accounts didn’t have one subscription price but several, depending on promotions or length of time subscribed. I set the subscription price for all of these accounts to the minimum, $4.99.</p>
<p>If interested, you can find the code I used <a href="https://github.com/ThomHollands/onlyfans">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Nat Fried for helping get the data, Katie Hollands for reading an early draft and Flora Zamula for mentioning the importance of tips.</em></p>

      <title>Once an Addict, Always an Addict?</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_deprocrastination_co_blog_once-an-addict-always-an-addict/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p></p><p>Is an addictive personality a thing?</p><p>Is an addict’s brain permanently broken?</p><p>Can you recover from addiction or does it last a lifetime?</p><p>You’ve probably heard<em>Once an addict, always an addict (OAAA)</em>before. I had to explore whether it’s true because the implications of it are rather serious.</p><p>People have a lot of opinions about this topic, but they’re usually based on emotions, not reality, and lead to misconceptions. So I dove deep into the topic and looked at what science says about it.</p><p>Luckily, the catchphrase isn’t based on science.</p><p>And it can be really unhelpful to think this way.</p><p>Also,<em>Once an addict, always an addict</em>is not a viable position in today’s behavioral addictions centered around the internet, social media, technology because you can’t really quit them all.</p><p>Read the first part (<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/what-is-addiction">What is an addiction</a>) for this to make sense to you.</p><p>And now let’s dive into the topic proper.</p><p>There are 2 main ways of thinking about recovering from addictions.</p><p><strong>Opinion A:</strong></p><p>Addiction is a chronic disease that will keep returning to your life. Recovery is temporary (also called remission) and doesn’t mean you’re cured forever. This supports the<em>once an addict, always an addict</em>concept.</p><p><strong>Opinion B:</strong></p><p>Addiction is a learned way of coping with negative emotions that changes your brain rapidly. You can unlearn it, your brain will change once again via neuroplasticity.</p><p><strong>Arguments for A</strong></p><ol><li>Certain changes in the brain are long lasting and this might make you more susceptible to addictions. This probably depends on the severity, the length, and type of the addiction. Addictions can alter your brain so it won’t be functioning like it used to.</li></ol><ol><li>Your life has factors that make you prone to addiction - addictive personality (more on this below), you experienced a childhood trauma, you might be prone to depression, or anxiety.</li></ol><p><strong>Arguments for B</strong></p><ol><li>People who successfully recover from addiction live a better life. So calling it disease doesn’t help. When you recover from an addiction, you don’t go back to zero. Instead, you live a better life. You don’t return back to baseline so we shouldn’t call it recovery.<sup>[<a href="#ftnt1">1]</a></sup></li><li>People overcome addiction without any formal treatment all the time and sometimes it is out of nowhere.<sup>[<a href="#ftnt3">3]</a></sup></li><li>People who recover from addiction are less likely to take on another addiction.<sup>[<a href="#ftnt2">2]</a></sup></li></ol><p>If you compare the two, it’s an interesting development.</p><p>Opinion A (addiction = chronic disease) is based on the strongest version of the brain disease model of addiction.</p><p>A similar outlook is also supported by Alcoholics Anonymous. The first step in their recovery program is to admit that you have no control over your addiction and to commit to abstinence forever. This can be viable for substance use disorder or things you don’t have to engage with ever again. It’s a simple rule that people follow and people in AA build up streaks.</p><p>AA thinking makes sense and has been practiced for almost a century, but that doesn’t make it true. It’s based on 1930’s assumptions.</p><p>Opinion A can make people feel powerless.<em>I’m an addict and I’ll be that way forever</em>- it creates feelings of shame and being a victim. It also creates a stigma in society that addicts are somewhat broken and can’t be fixed.</p><p>Opinion A seems a little bit outdated. Abstinence isn’t necessarily the goal.</p><p>We think it’s not the best approach.</p><p>On the other hand, opinion B (addiction = a learned way of coping) provides a more helpful outlook on the topic. If your brain changes, you stop being addicted. If enough time passes, you can start engaging in the behavior in a healthy way once again.</p><p>This is the path to freedom and mastery. You’re not a slave of your addiction, you don’t have to be scared of it anymore.</p><p>This has some merit, for example, when it comes to alcohol - you can go from being addicted to alcohol, to having a social drink once a week.</p><p>Then there are things where there is no other way. You probably can’t realistically abstain from the Internet.</p><p>Opinion A would mean that if you’re addicted to the internet, you should abstain forever because it’s only time before you relapse and start using it compulsively again.</p><p>To resolve how much you can really recover from addiction, we need to resolve another question first.</p><h2 id="is-there-an-addictive-personality">Is there an addictive personality?</h2><p>There is a general notion that there is such a thing as an addictive personality.</p><p>Once again, even if something makes sense, it doesn’t make it true.</p><p>There is limited support for the concept of addictive personality in scientific studies. Certain people are more anxious, and worse at dealing with stress. They can have a certain genetic makeup that makes them more prone to anxiety. These people might be more susceptible to addictions. But that doesn’t mean they have an addictive personality.</p><p><strong>Thinking that you have an addictive personality is unhelpful</strong>. It’s something you can’t change and it rather victimizes the addict and can be used as an excuse to not do anything about their current state.</p><p>People often claim to have an addictive personality. Especially, when they seem to be trading one addiction for another. But what if they don’t have an addictive personality? What if they become addicted all the time because they don’t resolve the underlying cause of their addictions?</p><p>Another argument people use is that addictions run in their family. In reality, there are probably more factors involved.</p><p>Yes, the family might be more susceptible to stress and anxiety through genes.</p><p>Or maybe, if the family has to deal with an addict, it can cause a lot of stress or even trauma to the family which can cause another person to become addicted as an escape from this.</p><p>It might also be the case that the whole family is ill-equipped to deal with stress and anxiety… If parents don’t know how to deal with emotions, their kid usually doesn’t learn it as well.</p><p>As an aside, no wonder people are ill-equipped to deal with their emotions. After all, it’s been only a decade or two since it became somewhat socially accepted for a man to actually have feelings and experience emotions. Before, you were told to man up and just deal with it.</p><p>Addictive personality is only weakly supported by science and it can be unhelpful in overcoming addictions because it’s something you can’t change.</p><h2 id="so-can-you-recover-from-an-addiction">So can you recover from an addiction?</h2><p>You most certainly can.</p><p>People do it all the time without any formal treatment. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. Depending on how much the brain is altered by the addiction, it can be super difficult.</p><p>Also, most studies have been done on substances (drugs, alcohol, cigarettes). You can view behavior addictions like the lite versions of addictions, so the recovery will be quicker.</p><p><strong>Q: Is my brain ever going to be functioning normally? Or is it permanently broken?</strong></p><p>A: Your brain is adaptive and neuroplasticity will take place.</p><p>In certain cases, the brain won’t ever be the same, but it can become functional again. It depends on the length of the addiction and the type of addiction (chemical addictions being much worse). But most people recover.</p><p>I think, there is an even more interesting question</p><p><strong>Q: Can I ever come back to the behavior?</strong></p><p>A: The neural pathways will be there for a long time, so you have to remember that you’re more susceptible. What wires together, fires together.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you need to avoid the behavior forever.</p><p>There are people who went through AA, recovered from their alcohol addiction, and are able to drink moderately.</p><p>Increasing the likelihood you can safely come back to the behavior depends on how much you resolve the underlying causes of the addiction.</p><p>The 3 conditions are following:</p><ul><li>If enough time passes—we’re talking of months or years—your brain rewires.</li><li>You learn how to deal with your emotions much more,</li><li>Your life is better than it used to be.</li></ul><p>If you meet these conditions, then you’re probably ready to engage in the behavior again. Once again, we’re talking about behavioral addictions only (no drugs, alcohol, cigarettes - it can be more tricky with them).</p><p>This means that you might try to engage in the addictive behavior you used to do.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p>If you’re addicted to social media, you might use them in a time limited window.</p><p>Gaming 2 days per week after finishing all your responsibilities.</p><p>Watching Netflix only with friends on the weekend.</p><p>Deal with these like experiments, nothing temporary. If you can’t do it, you’re not ready… or you don’t have to ever return to the potentially addictive behavior if you don’t want to.</p><p>Doesn’t that sound better?</p><p>Breaking your shackles, overcoming addiction, and then not being worried about it anymore.</p><p>Especially with behavioral addictions, it might even be desirable to do something moderately.</p><p>It sounds like growth as a person.</p><h2 id="what-about-other-addictive-things">What about other addictive things?</h2><p>If you successfully overcame one addiction, you might be less susceptible to others.<sup>[<a href="#ftnt2">2]</a></sup></p><p>Because you have already developed a toolbox to deal with emotional adversity. Also, people also know how much it sucks to be addicted so they are wary of another addiction.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you should go and try coke because you overcame a different addiction. No, this is to break the habit of thinking that you have an addictive personality.</p><p>We’ve already explained that an addictive personality is more of a construct.</p><p>On one hand, thinking that you have an addictive personality can be helpful because you’re scared of addiction and you will abstain on purpose from other things.</p><p>On the other hand, it also can make you feel like you’re powerless and can make you more susceptible to getting addicted. Especially if you give in and start engaging in addictive behavior, you might feel you aren’t in control.</p><p>It’s better to not use the addictive personality concept because you can’t change it and focus on areas you can improve: becoming more mindful of your behavior, learning how to deal with your emotions, and improving your life in general.</p><p>If you do this, you will increase the probability that you won’t get addicted again.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p><em>Once an addict, always an addict</em>is a catchy phrase that isn’t based on real science.</p><p>You can recover from addiction and even moderate the behavior later on in life.</p><p>Your brain can start functioning normally again in a span of a few months. It doesn’t have to be the same, but it should work just fine.</p><p>If you successfully overcome an addiction, resolve the underlying issues, you might even be less prone to future addiction.</p><p>The next question is then, how to recover from addiction?</p></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On a Friday afternoon, a team official from Thailand perused the toiletries section where a pair of quality nail clippers can be had for a few dollars. The ATMs often accept foreign debit and credit cards.</p><p>But packaged meals and delicacies are where these stores truly shine, with so much more than ever-rotating hot dogs and re-warmed chicken strips. The selection changes constantly, new arrivals announced weekly on the internet, anticipated with the same fervor otherwise reserved for the release of Yeezy sneakers or an album drop.</p>
<p>Featured items during the final days of the  Games included plump sea urchin rice bowls and pork yakiniku bento with onion sauce. 7-Elevens, owned by a Japanese corporation, have collaborated with Michelin star restaurants on<i> </i>Tsuta Ramen and other instant noodles.</p><p>“The quality is next level,” says Kaila Imada, a senior editor for the multiplatform Time Out Tokyo, who has written connoisseur’s guides to the <i>konbini</i>. “You can find dinner there and it will be a top-notch dinner.”</p><div data-align-right="" data-click="enhancement">

<p>Not everything is fancy — the late food critic <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-bourdain-obit-20180608-story.html">Anthony Bourdain</a> once raved about Lawson’s egg-salad sandwich.</p>
<p>“So I’ve given up many vices in my life, many shameful, filthy, guilty pleasures that I used to like that I just don’t do anymore. Cocaine, heroin, prostitutes, the musical styling of Steven Tyler,” he said during his “Parts Unknown” series on CNN. “One thing I just can’t give up. One thing I keep coming back to every time I come back to Japan.”</p><p>Bourdain referred to the plastic-wrapped sandos — as they are called here — as “pillows of love.”</p><p><b>::</b></p><p>The initial jolt is more than visual. This immersive experience begins at the sliding glass doors as you leave the city’s heat behind, stepping into a blast of air conditioning. Music plays from hidden speakers, accompanied by a symphony of commerce.</p><p>As Japanese author Sayaka Murata writes in her novel “Convenience Store Woman”:</p>
<p><i>A convenience store is a world of sound. From the tinkle of the door chime to the voices of TV celebrities advertising new products over the in-store cable network, to the calls of the store workers, the beeps of the bar code scanner, the rustle of customers picking up items and placing them in baskets, and the clacking of heels walking around the store. It all blends into the convenience store sound that ceaselessly caresses my eardrums …</i></p><p><i>A convenience store is not merely a place where customers come to buy practical necessities. It has to be somewhere they can enjoy and take pleasure in discovering things they like.</i></p>
<p>This public communion draws congregants of all ages and demographics. In the morning, salarymen with their pressed white shirts and briefcases wait in line behind kids getting something to eat before school. Workers in blue coveralls stop by for lunch. Dinnertime? Be prepared to wait. </p>
<p>A love of <i>konbini</i> and its community spurred two Americans living in Japan, Michael Markey and Matthew Savas, to start a podcast last year. “Conbini Boys,” which uses an alternate spelling, has grown to 62 episodes.</p><p>“It’s structural to Japanese society,” Savas, who has since moved back to the U.S., says of the stores. “You’ll see all kinds of people going to a <i>konbini</i>.”</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement"><figure>

    <p>7-Eleven stores in Tokyo feature a number of unique food items like dried squid and smoked squid.</p><p>(Gary Ambrose / For The Times)</p>
        </div>

</div>
<p>The prices are reasonable, with meals costing $3 to $6. A dollar buys a puck-sized korokke — or croquette — with a blend of potato and beef that tastes both sweet and savory. People can rely on the stores to be open, no matter what.</p>
<p>“We call them our local superheroes,” Imada says. “They’re always there for us, 24 hours a day, whatever you need … they’re always open regardless of rain, shine or typhoon.”</p><p>Shinichi Mine and Satoshi Tanaka, whose “TabiEats” YouTube channel has more than 500,000 subscribers, visited Los Angeles before the pandemic and decided to sample breakfast at an American 7-Eleven. They were in for a surprise.</p>
<p>“It says fresh fruits on the container, but actually it wasn’t fresh. It was actually previously frozen because the fruits were soggy and bad,” Mine said. “Even the breakfast sandwich was soggy for some reason.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t a simple thing like this be a bit better?” he asked. “It’s kind of strange.”</p><p>The bottom line might be part of the answer.</p><p>Because they throw out fresh items that aren’t sold quickly enough, <i>konbini</i> account for part of an estimated 640,000 tons of food wasted annually in Japan, according to a 2019 report by the NHK news service. Lawson and 7-Eleven started programs to discount items close to their expiration time. </p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement"><figure>

<p>The U.S. business model favors a longer, more-profitable shelf life. American convenience stores, often linked to gas stations, have conditioned customers to expect something different, as in Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Red Vines.</p><p>“In the U.S., the idea of convenience is linked not only to the idea of quick, but also cheap,” Linda Hagen, an assistant professor who studies consumer behavior at USC’s Marshall School of Business, wrote in an email. “So this close mental association that convenience equals fast, cheap, unhealthy is a big part of why convenience stores offer the assortments they do.”<br/></p><p>::</p><p> <i>Konbini</i> have played a special role at these Pandemic Games.</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement"><figure>

<p>With  coronavirus cases surging in Tokyo, foreigners have been asked to limit interaction with the populace, but convenience stores have been a conspicuous exception. Pump bottles of sanitizer are stationed at the entrance and plastic sheets hang in front of registers.</p>
<p>No fluency in Japanese is required; checkout counters feature large touch screens that guide customers through transactions. With a minimum of pointing, a typically patient clerk shows an Uzbek journalist how to feed coins into the cash slot and everyone has learned to gesture if they need a plastic bag. Not all meals have English on the label, so people crowd around the refrigerated shelves, scrutinizing the fried rice and beef dishes, grabbing whatever looks good.</p><p>The mention of convenience stores among Americans here prompts smiles and starts everyone chattering about their favorite purchases. Savas rhapsodizes about shopping at a <i>konbini </i>early on, trying a dish called chiki, which is boneless chicken from a hot box.</p><p>“I distinctly remember sitting in my car, biting into it and a gush of juice bursting out of the chicken, splashing my glasses and clothes,” he said. “From that day forward, I was a changed man.”</p><p>Each visit offers so many choices, so many opportunities for something you have never tasted before. Growing bolder with experience, you might reach for deep-fried fish paste or smoked gizzards.</p>
<p>The first time at  a <i>konbini</i>, though, can be tough.</p><p>Your eyes dart from package to package as the theme song from “The Little Mermaid” tinkles in the background. All those shapes and textures, the Japanese characters in bold type. So many colors — crimson, chartreuse, neon yellow — you don’t normally associate with food.</p><p>The first time, you might just reach for the egg-salad sandwich.</p></div></div>

This is made possible by connecting to a bunch of third party API’s. It’s an amazing fact that so many companies expose API’s that allow you to integrate with their service, to mutual benefit. Using such API’s is fairly trivial and even though things like OAuth implementations quite often diverge from the standard, it’s usually not too hard to set up.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="ca1c">However<em>, testing</em> such integrations is painful.</p><p id="7e14">Proper end-to-end test<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">i</span></span>ng is not feasible in a CI setup. It’s not only slow and relies on access to outside servers that could be down, it’s also next to impossible to set up useful fixtures.</p><p id="e280">Initially I tried to set up a record/playback system to alleviate this. That works well in some situations, but Submotion almost always connects via OAuth which is difficult to automate (by design), and even then, I still had the issue with fixtures. I would want to test that Submotion detects, say, that an account has been deleted. In order to do that, I had to actually create and subsequently delete an account in Slack or whatever, a very involved task. </p><p id="636b">I was discussing this with my friend Lars who has put a lot of thought into these and <a href="https://www.fullstackagile.eu/2016/03/20/dont-let-your-mocks-lie-to-you/" rel="noopener nofollow">similar</a> <a href="https://www.fullstackagile.eu/2021/06/24/bluetooth-ble-mock-recorder/" rel="noopener nofollow">issues</a>. He suggested that I <em>move the assertions from the test into production code</em>. Now, I remember doing this sort of thing a lot in C++ where assertions are common in the debug build and then removed in production. However, this didn’t feel like a Node-native approach and it rubbed me the wrong way somehow. But, as he pointed out, such assertions could just log warnings in production, and when running locally or via tests, they could throw. That way, I would continuously run validation on real responses meaning that said validations are kept up to date and good enough to keep my mock data sound. Although this is strictly validating, it still feels to me like a variation on the <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/" rel="noopener nofollow">parse, don’t validate</a> philosophy coined by Alexis King. And while it’s still work in progress, so far it’s a big step forward.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="930e">Here is what I do in practice:</p><ol><li id="cbbf">Make a request or two to the 3rd party API in question, and save the JSON responses in a file.

Your theory that oil is from decomposed plankton is impossible. Fracking (hydrolic fracturing) releases oil from beneath the earth’s crust. There were never living creatures that deep inside the earth. Oil is produced in the center of the earth in a process of which we are ignorant. We don’t even have a decent hypothesis about abiotic oil.
Please stop propagating easily disproved theories as if they are science. Next, you’ll tell us that humans are causing climate change and we killed the dinosaurs.</td>

Saturn&#39;s smoggy moon Titan has hundreds of times more natural gas and other liquid hydrocarbons than all the known oil and natural gas reserves on Earth.

An intelligent refutation of a commonly held belief. It never made sense to me and with the literally billions of gallons of crude that has been pumped out of the ground and the amount remaining it seemed untenable that that many dinosaurs existed.</td>

I too once believed that petroleum was distilled from animal remains of eons past. However massive amounts of hydrocarbons are found in our solar system that have no life to provide the stock to produce the oil from. So where did this enormous amount of liquid hydrocarbon come from? Good question, but certainly not from dinosaurs or the like. There is a moon of Saturn that has oceans of surface hydrocarbons. A geologist proposed this idea several years ago to the consternation of the mass of oilmen. But still his ideas made good sense. Thank you for your contribution on this subject, very interesting.

      <title>Is Britain becoming more meritocratic than America?</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 1774 THOMAS PAINE</small> left Britain for America to become a radical pamphleteer and revolutionary agitator. In “Common Sense”, published two years later, he explained why he had chosen to emigrate. Britain was built on heredity, a loathsome practice rooted in theft (William the Conqueror was the original bandit who stole the people’s land) and perpetuated by idiocy (what could be more absurd than giving a job to someone because of who their parents were?). “The artificial noble sinks into a dwarf before the noble of nature,” he said, and Britain was a land of artificial nobles. America, by contrast, was animated by the glorious principle of merit.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/047%20Britain%20-%20Bagehot-dcd6e5cec6e5f862f3e12a76f964fc02.mp3" title="Is Britain becoming more meritocratic than America?" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p>Paine’s argument has been a fixture of British thinking ever since. “England is the most class-ridden country under the sun,” George Orwell complained in 1941: “a land of snobbery and privilege”. In William Golding’s novel, “Rites of Passage”, published in 1980, a character laments that “Class is the British language”. And it is to America that the British habitually look for opportunity unencumbered by nonsense about parentage and the pronunciation of the letter “h”. Chartists in the 1830s and 1840s sang “Yankee Doodle” and waved the American flag. In the 1960s and 1970s, moderate leftists such as Tony Crosland and Shirley Williams wanted to make Britain more like America. British-American transplants like Henry James and T.S. Eliot were snobs; America attracted British radicals like W.H. Auden and Christopher Hitchens.</p><p>This contrast between hierarchical Britain and meritocratic America has always been exaggerated. America has no monarchy or House of Lords, but it has dynastic families such as the Adamses, Kennedys and Bushes. It has no equivalent of British aristocrats’ cut-glass vowels, but it has cliques such as the Boston Brahmins and the Proper Philadelphians, not to mention the Southern gentry. America gives ambassadorships to big party donors rather than professional diplomats, a practice the British abandoned in the mid-19th century. As president, Donald Trump was flagrantly nepotistic, relying on his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner. But compared with the Bushes, Clintons and Kennedys, this was evolution, not revolution.</p><p>Social mobility stagnated in both countries as the winners from the Thatcher and Reagan revolutions consolidated their gains. But Britain is trying much harder than America to get it going once again. A combination of British angst and American complacency may be the beginning of a great reversal: Britain is becoming more meritocratic, even as America becomes less so.</p><p>True, two Old Etonians, David Cameron and Boris Johnson, recently made it to the top of the Conservative Party. But the number of <small>MP</small>s from modest backgrounds has been rising, especially with the conquest of northern constituencies in 2019. The Treasury, Foreign Office, Home Office and Department of Health are all led by the children of immigrants. In broadcast journalism, and arguably in business, an upper-class bray is increasingly a handicap.</p><p>The two countries’ differing trajectories are perhaps most obvious in education, especially in admissions to the universities that act as gatekeepers to the elite. A comparison of Oxford and Harvard is telling. Oxford is trying hard to attract poor and working-class applicants, and several of its colleges have introduced a “foundation year” to get them up to speed before they start degree courses. In 2020, 68% of the undergraduates it admitted, excluding those from overseas, had attended state schools. That was up from 62% in 2019, and 55% a decade ago.</p><p>This meritocratic push was aided by school reforms started in the 2000s by Labour governments, and continued by the Tories since 2010, which created schools in inner cities that offer education of the highest standard. One is Brampton Academy in Newham, a poor London borough, which draws most of its pupils from ethnic minorities. Last year it won 55 places in Oxford and Cambridge, more than Eton’s 48. Its sixth form is highly selective, and provides intensive coaching for Oxbridge entrance exams.</p><p>By contrast Harvard, like other elite American universities, practises plutocracy modified by affirmative action for African-American applicants and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic ones. The intention is to compensate for the terrible injustice of slavery and, more broadly, to find merit where it was once overlooked. But it is undermined by an almost wilful blindness to disadvantage that stems from class, not race. Harvard recruits more students from the richest 1% than the poorest 60%, discriminating in favour of relatives of faculty and alumni (known as “legacies”), star athletes and the “dean’s list”, which mysteriously tends to feature the offspring of politicians, celebrities and donors. “Holistic assessment” of candidates encourages <small>CV</small>s that bristle with boasts about pricey trips to Africa to help the poor. It boosts the well-connected, who can get supporting letters from impressive names. Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University calculates that three-quarters of successful white applicants in these favoured categories would have been rejected if they had been treated the regular way.</p><h2>Changing places</h2><p>And rather than creating institutions like Brampton Academy to prise open Harvard’s gates, America’s policymakers are dismantling elite public schools. Boston Latin School in Boston and Lowell High School in San Francisco, which have a fine record of getting their pupils into Ivy League universities, are being forced to drop entrance examinations and admit by lottery, which will probably mean an end to academic excellence.</p><p>Even as America’s ingrained belief that it is a meritocracy is taken as licence to behave in a flagrantly anti-meritocratic fashion, Britain’s anxiety about being class-bound seems to have made it hypersensitive to unearned privilege (excepting a few institutions granted special status, such as the monarchy). This anxiety may finally be producing positive results, rather than, as so often in the past, nothing more useful than self-doubt. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><strong><em>Correction (August 6th 2021):</em></strong> A previous version of this article accused William James of being a snob.

<p>Mike, I love this. I won&#39;t be shouting your plans from the rooftops, just quietly staying here in the forums and supporting the Pi-type plans. I mentioned, and I&#39;ll say again, if AB wanted to created a little Pinode for the home server instance I&#39;d probably spend money on it. I get that you probably don&#39;t want to get into hardware sales directly as it might be a pain for legal, regulatory, support, liability, etc. Maybe partnering with a Pi-community or someone to help make it unofficial official.</p>
<p>The world has been scary and sad of late, so happy to have you and others doing your work and our discussion today.</p>

<blockquote><p>It would actually be battle-tested already as it would replicate what we use for 1Password service already, just pushed down into a self-contained service that you can run locally. Plus it&#39;d work out of the box with same 1Password apps (including 1Password beta for Linux here) that uses the same 1Password APIs which handles the syncing automatically because the local service is the oracle of truth (that tells 1Password how to sync in your network). The only difference is that you&#39;d have to run backups on your own but that&#39;s not any different from what you&#39;d have to do now with standalone vaults.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like this moves into a direction, where we will get our own little 1Password cloud service </p>
<p>And as I&#39;m having troubles to move documents to local vaults again, this sounds even better, because this definitely won&#39;t happen if this is also the same cloud-like platform!</p>
<p>Two more thoughts:</p>
<ul><li>I hope the database which is linked to the stateless container, will be recoverable (I&#39;m thinking about the problems in the Windows world where you have to recover a client (or even the Domain Controller) and suddenly it fell out of the domain because the trust isn&#39;t given anymore)</li>
<li>I would be really pleased if there is a ARM version (as the Pi&#39;s are ARM driven) that we would also get a x86 version, I think I would love to run this on my vSphere cluster </li>
</ul><p>Oh and it&#39;s so great to see you and your colleagues also being so passionate, this makes this thread even better! Everybody foreseeing kind of the same bright future </p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is all still mostly theoretical, nothing is a sure thing but all of this is the desire we have right now as we continue to focus and evolve 1Password on Linux. Another hint of what the future may bring is in our recent interview here: <a href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fserokell.io%2Fblog%2Frust-in-production-1password">https://serokell.io/blog/rust-in-production-1password</a></p>
<blockquote><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p></blockquote>

<p>I echo what Mike just said. I think our best bet is to wait with some patience and continue on our current versions before we proceed. Mike is providing us a bit of a peak under the covers at the new model year car before a reveal (so to speak) but nothing is in stone. I do not plan to advertise his conversations with us anywhere else in hopes that he is allowed a bit more leeway to provide a little inside baseball in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://1password.community/profile/MikeT" rel="nofollow">@MikeT</a>, Thank you for the detailed responses. I agree with <a href="https://1password.community/profile/Sn0man" rel="nofollow">@Sn0man</a> &#39;s comments that I hope you’re reading our desires in a positive and passionate 1Password advocate light, and the willingness to assist.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#39;re talking about basically maintaining two different apps within the same interface (one example: one app uses a simple API to make a single item change quickly and another uses the local file system to replace an entire file to modify it)</p></blockquote>
<p>That does clarify the issue, thank you. And I agree with your statement that this forum and thread is more biased toward your power users.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we have an option to block sending data to specific platforms already.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this, and would be interested in getting the more granular information you mentioned. I use the same OS for a few different places, but I want to control which vaults can be accessed by device. Something I raised in a support ticket, is that I&#39;d also like to be able to control by user on the device. I have a work around for that with the local storage, but it&#39;s definitely not ideal. I certainly take your critique that mac address can be spoofed, and that something more secure is needed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just to clarify, the Docker solution if possible would just be all local. It would not be syncing anything to the cloud. If you want to include both in the same 1Password app, you can because you&#39;d just enter the sign in address of the docker&#39;s instance and treat it like a second 1Password account, it&#39;s just local. This is why this docker idea is far more desirable for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was thinking that the docker container would be more like a separate vault. Can you clarify what you mean by a second account?</p>
<p>Part of the reason I ended up checking on the linux beta was I ran into an issue where my main computer died (mac OS) and then took out my access to the local vaults. I have them backed up, but didn&#39;t have a way to access them.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://1password.community/profile/A10" rel="nofollow">@A10</a>,</p>
<p>You&#39;re welcome.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was thinking that the docker container would be more like a separate vault. Can you clarify what you mean by a second account?</p></blockquote>
<p>You can have multiple 1Password.com (<em>and .ca/.eu</em>) memberships, for an example; a lot of people have their own private 1Password account while also using a 1Password account from their work company (<em>or another team like a sport team, club, and/or another family</em>), they can sign in to any number of 1Password accounts in the same app. Each account have their own vaults, settings, permissions, and so on.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of me signed in with two 1Password accounts, one called <code spellcheck="false" tabindex="0">Item Editors</code> and <code spellcheck="false" tabindex="0">samurai</code> is another testing account I use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><code spellcheck="false" tabindex="0">Everything</code> view is the union of both 1Password accounts in the same view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You could create a vault collection to show specific vaults from various 1Password accounts or just one like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Does that help clarify why Docker/container is desirable and why it means we&#39;d only have one app with a unified experience? It basically means you can treat the 1Password account from the container as a local account that you sign into the same 1Password app and the app wouldn&#39;t see any difference between them. The local account can have any number of vaults you want to keep local and other 1Password account you sign in can be hosted by us, your work company, and so on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Part of the reason I ended up checking on the linux beta was I ran into an issue where my main computer died (mac OS) and then took out my access to the local vaults. I have them backed up, but didn&#39;t have a way to access them.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you need it now, you can use a virtual machine (<em>KVM is built-in for Linux</em>) to run Windows and use our Windows app to access your standalone vaults.</p>
<p>That&#39;s part of why we offer the 1Password memberships, folks don&#39;t want to worry about backups and need access to their data anywhere at any time. You can use 1Password.com web app, 1Password command line tool, 1Password in your browser, any apps we have available at the moment, which we&#39;re extending with Linux now and more in the future.</p>

<p>It is very enlightening to read through all your thoughts and Ideas. Gets me all excited about future feature possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Encrypted Exports</strong></p>
<p>Local vaults keep their own backups for the entire vault but they don&#39;t keep the entire history like what can be seen through the my.1password.com site unless those are back-up separately before they are removed. Is it possible to open a local vault as read only on a device?</p>

<p>Thank you so much for the kind words, <a href="https://1password.community/profile/johann_koebbe" rel="nofollow">@johann_koebbe</a>. 🤗</p>
<p>Regarding the encrypted exports, <a href="https://1password.community/profile/MONKi1P" rel="nofollow">@MONKi1P</a>, it will be a different format than what we used in opvault. These exports will have an accompanying command line tool that will allow you to decrypt these files so you&#39;ll always be able to access your data. As for the item history that you can view on 1password.com, that will not be included. The export will include the information that&#39;s stored in the client&#39;s local cache.</p>

<p>Just read through this whole thread, pretty informative.</p>
<p>Adding myself as a +1 for some kind of standalone/self hosted Linux solution that doesn&#39;t involve an external network. Been a user/supporter for well over a decade now and I recently set up 1Password on Linux for the first time and was disappointed to see I couldn&#39;t use my current sync solution, but such is life.</p>
<p>Also not concerned with the financial aspect, happy to pay a monthly subscription, just want control over where/how I sync things.</p>

<p>Yeah, if something doesn&#39;t happen soon I&#39;m migrating to bitwarden, which we&#39;ve just deployed at work after ruling out 1password, because of the lack of local vault storage.</p>
<p>Honestly it&#39;s a pity, I&#39;d rather stay with 1pass, but this lack of local vaults is hindering the acceptability of the software for many it seems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s great to hear you saw the news! Yes indeed, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.1password.com%2Fwelcoming-linux-to-the-1password-family%2F">1Password for Linux has officially launched</a>! 🎉🥳🎊</p>
<p>The launch was a huge success so you&#39;re right, now would be a great time to revisit this discussion. As described in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/discussion/comment/576271/#Comment_576271">my comment above</a> it will be incredibly difficult to add support for local vaults as 1Password for Linux relies on the server to perform a lot of the heavy lifting. The most likely path towards a modern day version of local vaults would be self-hosting of the 1Password service.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve seen some excitement for self-hosting in this thread and a few others as well so there&#39;s definitely some interest in this idea. It&#39;s hard to gauge interest piecemeal like this, however, so I&#39;d like to measure things more formally with a survey. I&#39;m putting together a set of questions to see who wants this feature, how it will help them, and some detailed questions to help ensure we build the right thing if and when we decide to move forward on this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll update this thread with the survey once it&#39;s ready. I&#39;m planning on using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2Fsecrets">1Password Secrets Automation</a> to store survey responses directly within one of my vaults. I thought this would be a fabulous way to ensure we protect the privacy of people&#39;s information and their comments. It also gives me a great opportunity to geek out with our other big launch of this year. 🙂</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Excellent work on the linux app and thank you, it is an amazing release. That being said, like some I cannot adopt it as my default pw manager without either local only vaults or the ability to choose sync location. Hopefully that will make it into a future release, I think that&#39;s a crucial feature these days.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://1password.community/profile/vwest" rel="nofollow">@vwest</a>! Thank you for the kind words. 🤗 It&#39;s great to hear you excitement about 1Password for Linux! 😍</p>
<p>I merged your question into this thread as I have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/discussion/comment/598946/#Comment_598946">a long winded response</a> just above your comment that answers this in detail.</p>
<p>Please give it a read to see where we&#39;re at and watch for an update from me in the future with details on the survey. In the meantime, however, I&#39;d like to better understand the &#34;or the ability to choose sync location&#34; part of your question. How are you syncing today?</p>
<p>Take care and enjoy the rest of your weekend. 👋</p>

<p>Hello everyone, 👋</p>
<p>Last week we announced <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.1password.com%2F1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access%2F">early access for 1Password 8 on Windows</a> and along with it we also completed setting up our self-hosting survey. For everyone who is using local/standalone vaults entirely within your network (i.e. no cloud based sync services like Dropbox or iCloud) and would like to self-host your very own 1Password service, please take this survey:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fsurvey.1password.com%2Fself-host">Self-hosted 1Password kick-starter</a></p>
<p>We&#39;ll be using this survey to gauge interest in this feature, as well as making sure we build the right solution in the event there is enough demand to move things forward.</p>
<p>As for privacy, this survey is powered by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2Fsecrets">1Password Secret Automation</a>. All data collected is stored within a special 1Password vault that will only be shared with myself and select 1Password employees. Your email will only be used for discussions around this feature.</p>
<p>If self-hosting is something you&#39;re interested in, please complete the survey to let us know! 🤗</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://1password.community/profile/Axell" rel="nofollow">@Axell</a>, 👋</p>
<p>By &#34;cases&#34; I&#39;m assuming you mean vaults, the main &#34;encrypted container&#34; that items are kept within. To clarify, in 1Password 7 we had two types of vaults: vaults used with the 1Password.com service and what we called &#34;local vaults&#34; or &#34;standalone vaults&#34; which were synced however you decided to, typically Dropbox or iCloud.</p>
<p>Assuming we&#39;re talking about the same feature, then the answer is no, they are not implemented as the new releases do not have support for local/standalone vaults and 1Password 7 will be the last version to support them. The new apps rely on the server to perform a lot of the heavy lifting so we will not be adding support for local vaults as they existed in earlier versions.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a possibility that we can achieve the same goals in a different way. A new, modern day equivalent of local vaults would be self-hosting of the 1Password service. We&#39;ve seen some excitement in this thread for this feature and so we created a survey to better understand people&#39;s needs and desires for such a service. If this sounds like something you&#39;d be interested in, please take the survey:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://1password.community/home/leaving?allowTrusted=1&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fsurvey.1password.com%2Fself-host%2F">Self-hosted 1Password kick-starter</a></p>
<p>The hope of the survey is to help gauge demand to help us decide if this is something we should build and to help us ensure we do things in a way people will like if we decide to move forward here.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. Please let me know,</p>

</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The document doesn&#39;t contain any of the internal messages where such a plan is considered, but a previously redacted paragraph is now included in court documents, as reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612921/google-epic-antitrust-case-court-filings-unsealed">by The Verge yesterday</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>&#34;For example, Google has gone so far as to share its monopoly profits with business partners to secure their agreement to fence out competition, has developed a series of internal projects to address the &#39;contagion&#39; it perceived from efforts by Epic and others to offer consumers and developers competitive alternatives, and has even contemplated buying some or all of Epic to squelch this threat.&#34;</blockquote>
<p>Responding to the Verge article on Twitter, Epic Games CEO said that they were only finding out now &#34;about Google&#39;s consideration&#34;:
</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This was unbeknownst to us at the time, and because of the court’s protective order we’re just finding out now about Google’s consideration of buying Epic to shut down our efforts to compete with Google Play.<a href="https://t.co/HSS1edUrQm">https://t.co/HSS1edUrQm</a></p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423677740851531781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere in the court documents, Epic also allege that Google offered them a &#34;special deal&#34; to launch Fortnite on the Google Play store, which they rejected, and referred to the experience of installing apps on Android phones outside of the store as &#34;frankly abysmal.&#34; 
</p>

</iframe></figure>
<p>Much of the document&#39;s claims and offered evidence remains redacted, but Epic further allege that after they signed a distribution agreement for Fortnite with Samsung&#39;s Android app store, Google &#34;took action to ensure that OEMs would not enter into partnerships with distributors like Epic.&#34;</p>
<p>A lot of attention has been paid to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apple-fires-shots-at-epic-for-hosting-itchio-and-its-offensive-and-sexualised-games">Epic&#39;s lawsuit against Apple</a> regarding restrictions on the app store, but their lawsuit against Google was launched on the same day and is related to the same issue. Epic claim that Apple and Google&#39;s control of their app store&#39;s constitutes a monopoly, and want to be able to offer users alternative routes to buying their games such as Fortnite - without having to give Apple or Google a 30% cut. The outcomes of both cases have enormous ramifications for Apple and Google&#39;s walled gardens, and for every software developer who releases on those platforms. It could also have consequences for other platforms including consoles, and other digital stores such as Steam.

    <p>Analysts call it the “energy performance gap” — the difference between promised energy savings in green buildings and the actual savings delivered. The problem, researchers say, is inept modeling systems that fail to capture how buildings really work.</p>

<p>Not long ago in the southwest of England, a local community set out to replace a 1960s-vintage school with a new building using triple-pane windows and super-insulated walls to achieve the highest possible energy efficiency. The new school proudly opened on the same site as the old one, with the same number of students, and the same head person—and was soon burning more energy in a month than the old building had in a year.</p>

<div>
<p>The underfloor heating system in the new building was so badly designed that the windows automatically opened to dump heat several times a day even in winter.  A camera in the parking lot somehow got wired as if it were a thermal sensor, and put out a call for energy any time anything passed in front of the lens.  It was “a catalogue of disasters,” according to David Coley, a University of Bath specialist who came in to investigate.</p>
<p>Many of the disasters were traceable to the building energy model, a software simulation of energy use that is a critical step in designing any building intended to be green. Among other errors, the designers had extrapolated their plan from a simplified model of an isolated classroom set in a flat landscape, with full sun for much of the day. That dictated window tinting and shading to reduce solar gain. Nobody seems to have noticed that the new school actually stood in a valley surrounded by shade trees and needed all the solar gain it could get.  The classrooms were so dark the lights had to be on all day.   </p>
<p>It was an extreme case.  But it was also a good example, according to Coley, of how overly optimistic energy modeling helps cause the “energy performance gap,” a problem that has become frustratingly familiar in green building projects.   The performance gap refers to the failure of energy improvements, often undertaken at great expense, to deliver some (or occasionally all) of the promised savings. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816303814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> last year of refurbished apartment buildings in Germany, for instance, found that they missed the predicted energy savings by anywhere from 5 to 28 percent. In Britain, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-carbon-buildings-best-practices-and-what-to-avoid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an evaluation</a> of 50 “leading-edge modern buildings,” from supermarkets to health care centers, reported that they “were routinely using up to 3.5 times more energy than their design had allowed for” — and producing on average 3.8 times the predicted carbon emissions</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>Buildings account for 40 percent of climate change emissions and are the fastest growing source of emissions. </blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>The performance gap is “a vast, terrible enormous problem,” in the words of one building technology specialist, and that’s not an exaggeration.  Though much of the public concern about energy consumption and climate change focuses on automotive miles-per-gallon, the entire transport sector — including trains, planes, ships, trucks, and cars — accounts for just 26 percent of U.S. climate change emissions.  Buildings come in at 40 percent, and they are the fastest growing source of emissions, according to the U.S. Green Building Council.  </p>
<p>Eliminating the performance gap matters particularly for European Union nations, which have a legally binding commitment to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/eu_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce emissions by 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels</a> by mid-century.  But knowing with confidence what savings will result matters for anybody trying to figure out how much to invest in a particular energy improvement.</p>
<p>Researchers have generally blamed the performance gap on careless work by builders, overly complicated energy-saving technology, or the bad behaviors of the eventual occupants of a building.  But in a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0143624416684641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a>, Coley and his co-authors put much of the blame on inept energy modeling.  The title of the study asks the provocative question “Are Modelers Literate?” Even more provocatively, a <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/news/2017/05/02/illiterate-modellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> from the University of Bath likens the misleading claims about building energy performance to the Volkswagen emissions scandal, in which actual emissions from diesel engine cars were up to 40 times higher than “the performance promised by the car manufacturer.”</p>
<p>For their study, Coley and his co-authors surveyed 108 building industry professionals — architects, engineers, and energy consultants — who routinely use energy performance models.  To keep the problem simple, the researchers asked participants to look at a typical British semi-detached home recently updated to meet current building codes. Then they asked test subjects to rank which improvements made the most difference to energy performance. Their answers had little correlation with objective reality, as determined by a study monitoring the actual energy performance of that home hour-by-hour over the course of a year. A quarter of the test subjects made judgments “that appeared worse than a person responding at random,” according to the study, which concluded that the sample of modelers, “and by implication the population of building modelers, cannot be considered modeling literate.”</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>‘We have cases where modelers will come up with a savings measure that is more than the energy use of the house,’ says one scientist. </blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>Predictably, that conclusion raised hackles. “The sample seems odd to me,” said Evan Mills, a building technology specialist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, “to include so many people who are junior in the practice, and then to be criticizing the industry at large.” He noted that almost two-thirds of the 108 test subjects had five years or less experience in construction.  But Coley and his co-authors found that even test subjects with “higher-level qualifications, or having many years of experience in modeling,” were no more accurate than their juniors. </p>
<p>In any case, Mills acknowledged, “the performance gap is real, and we must be aware of models not properly capturing things. We have cases where modelers will come up with a savings measure that is more than the energy use of the house, because they are just working with the model,” and not paying attention to the real house. </p>
<p>That sort of problem — energy models showing unreasonable results — also turns up at the preliminary stage on 50 percent of projects going through the LEED certification process, said Gail Hampsmire of the U.S. Green Building Council.   Designers have a tendency to take a “black box” approach, providing whatever inputs a particular energy model requires and then accepting the outputs “without evaluating the reasonability of those results,” she said. “You always have the issue of garbage in/garbage out, and the capability of the modeler to identify whether they are getting garbage out is critical.”</p>
<p>So what’s the fix?  The current accreditation requirements for energy modelers are “very gentle,” said Coley, but “when you’re trying to get something off the ground relatively quickly, you can’t send everybody back to college for three years.” In any case, the problem isn’t really education in the formal sense. </p>
<p>“It has to do with feedback,” he said, or the lack of it. The culture of building construction says it’s perfectly reasonable for architects — but not energy modelers —to travel hundreds of miles to see how the actual building compares with what they designed.  For energy modelers, there’s not even an expectation that they’ll get on the phone with the building manager at year one and ask how energy usage compares with the original model. As a result, said Coley, energy modeling can become like theoretical physics: “You can very easily create a whole web of theories, and then you find yourself studying the physics of your theories, not the physics of the real world.” </p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>The organization that gives LEED certification is now requiring that developers post actual energy usage on an online data base.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>The answer, he suggested, is a regulatory requirement that modelers follow up on their work by routinely checking their predictions against a building’s actual energy consumption. A system of modest inducements could also make that feedback more broadly available — for instance, by promising to take three weeks off the planning permissions process for developers who commit to posting actual energy usage to an online database. The Green Building Council has begun to require that sort of reporting for projects seeking LEED certification, said Hampsmire, with an online platform now in development “for building owners to track their own performance and compare it with other buildings.”</p>
<p>A second problem, according to Coley, is the tendency of government agencies to require simplified energy models at the start of the design process.  The requirements often include certain uniform assumptions about energy use, making it easier to compare one building with another.  “Because you have to do that at the start, it becomes the default, and this sets up a kind of ‘Alice in Wonderland’ world, and it’s not surprising that modelers model this artificial world.”  But at least in the United States that has become less of a problem in recent years, according to Hampsmire.  Current building code requirements are “fairly good,” she said. “They don’t say, ‘Model energy use for a building occupied eight hours a day,’” or some other arbitrary standard. Instead, “they specifically state that all energy use has to be modeled <em>as anticipated</em>.”</p>
<p>The takeaway from all this isn’t to discredit energy modeling but to improve it.  Builders increasingly need realistic modeling, said Coley, by people with a deep knowledge of building physics and at least as much experience with real buildings as with energy models. Without that, the result will be even more $500-million office blocks with too much glass on the southern exposure, causing everybody inside to bake on a hot summer afternoon.  Without smart energy modeling, the result will be a world spinning even faster into out-of-control climate change.</p>
<p>“This isn’t rocket science,” said the Berkeley Laboratory’s Mills.  But then he added, “It’s harder than rocket science.”</p>

                      <p>In archaeometallurgy, the study of ancient metal, archaeologists have historically taken a top-down approach, meaning that the jewelry, tools, weapons, and other artifacts they discover have come to signify a dominant ruling group that exerted overarching control over how to use such resources.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.penn.museum/">Penn Museum</a>’s <a href="https://anthropology.sas.upenn.edu/people/joyce-white">Joyce White</a> and Elizabeth Hamilton have a different idea.</p>

<p>In an open-access article in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352226721000519"><i>Archaeological Research in Asia</i></a>, the researchers argue that in Southeast Asia, where they have conducted the bulk of their work, communities actually took a bottom-up approach, each deciding how to use these precious resources rather than being told what to do with them. The article highlights key findings from a <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/16044.html">four-volume monograph suite</a> being published by Penn Press.</p>

<p>“A progressive view of human development originating in 19th-century perceptions of cultural evolution gets told over and over again. But it doesn’t work well when you look at areas in closer and finer detail,” says White, director of the Museum’s <a href="https://www.penn.museum/research/project.php?pid=10">Ban Chiang Project</a> and an adjunct professor in Penn’s <a href="https://anthropology.sas.upenn.edu/">Department of Anthropology</a>. “We should be looking at cultural development in fine-grained ways analogous to genetics, natural selection, the nitty gritty mechanisms by which cultures evolved.”</p>

<p>Though this line of thinking isn’t entirely new, it’s never before been applied to Southeast Asia, Hamilton says. “Such a reconsideration has been taking place, for example, in European archaeology and other places,” she says. “But where we work, the old ways of thinking tend to dominate.”</p>

<p><i>Penn Today</i> spoke to White and Hamilton about the paradigm shift in archaeology they hope to spark with this research, plus thoughts on where they see the field heading.</p>

                              <p><span>For Southeast Asia, to which specific metals are you referring?</span></p>
  <p><b>Hamilton: </b>Metals found in ancient Southeast Asia tend to be copper/bronze and iron. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. In much of the world, the appearance of bronze tends to roughly correlate with the rise of social hierarchy, partly, it’s assumed, because bronze is a beautiful, hard metal you can use for weapons or tools.</p>

<p>In most places, tin is relatively rare, so you usually must import it from a long way away. There’s this theory that elites, in the ancient Near East for example, were trying to control the tin trade because it’s a prestige good. But Southeast Asia is one of the few places where both copper and tin are readily available. No one needs to control it; no one can control it.</p>


    
                            <p><span>How did these metals reveal a bottom-up approach these communities were taking?</span></p>
  <p><b>White: </b>For metal to be produced,<b> </b>you must find the ores and then create the right physical conditions, which is a combination of atmosphere and temperature. In the case of bronze, you must do this with both tin and copper and then combine either the two ores in a furnace or the two metals in a crucible in certain proportions.</p>

<p><b>Hamilton:</b> And then you need to cast and/or hammer the product.</p>

<p><b>White:</b> The ability to produce metals was undoubtedly a significant technological development in human societies.</p>

<p><b>Hamilton:</b> You can create a stone tool or a pot by yourself. But creating a metal tool, a metal artifact is a group endeavor and a complex one.</p>

<p><b>White:</b> Complex and also requiring a great deal of knowledge, expertise, know-how. The big discomfort scholars from a European background have with metallurgy in Thailand is that all this complexity was done by non-urban, non-warring, non-hierarchical societies. Part of the point of our article is to offer a solid counternarrative to how this metal technology could be developed and exchanged not reliant on a top-down model but using an economic model that has been way underutilized in archaeology, one based on communities making decisions about how to participate in regional exchange systems.</p>


    
                            <p><span>Can you provide an example based on your findings?</span></p>
  <p><b>White: </b>In northern northeast Thailand, at Ban Chiang, bracelets were by far the most popular metal object made, and almost all of them were made of a tin-bronze alloy. If we go a few hundred kilometers south to another prehistoric site, bangles weren’t all that prominent. That community wasn’t so focused on jewelry. Instead, they had these odd-shaped adzes, which I haven’t seen from any other site, these little paddle shapes. At least two of them were made not of tin-bronze but of copper.</p>

<p>Looking at a small amount of evidence from lead isotopes, we can see that the northern site is getting its copper from Laos, and the southern site is getting its copper from central Thailand. To me, this is one of the coolest and most significant things we have found so far. In very early stages, villages are linking to different metal supply lines. They’re using locally specific technologies, and they’re making locally specific items. Production was not uniform.</p>

<p><b>Hamilton:</b> There’s also evidence that a lot of these small villages were manufacturing their own metal artifacts. We’ve found crucibles in most villages, along with other evidence for casting final products including molds. They were not importing them from some big central emporium that was churning out metal and metal products.</p>


    
                            <p><span>How does this research turn previous thinking about metallurgy on its head?</span></p>
  <p><b>Hamilton:</b> Most laboratory work on ancient metals is still performed on a loose collection of metal artifacts that were commonly excavated from graves, so they’re well-preserved, or they happen to be what the excavator allows the analyst to sample. Those studies often don’t sample all artifact types, periods, and contexts. In other words, most previous technical studies cherry-picked their samples.</p>

<p>Through our work, which sampled from entire <i>populations</i> of excavated metal objects, we can get a picture of the full evidence for the place metals held in an ancient society. We can look at specific changes through time, in context, in artifact type. The vast majority of archaeometallurgical investigations cannot reliably perceive such fine-grained details. We were lucky, of course, that we had pretty well-preserved metal artifacts.</p>

<p><b>White: </b>Beyond that,<b> </b>archaeologists of a traditional bent tend to have a particular thought structure called essentialism, which means that they do everything they can to come up with a coherent story according to a progressive view of social change. They keep looking for and exaggerate specific evidence to fit that progressive model. Southeast Asia is different. It offers an outstanding example of bottom-up social change, of community-level decision making. It’s a chance to study prehistoric societies in a more granular way, and it’s a fundamental shift for archaeologists. We’re still early on in trying to promote this different point of view and in using metals as a vehicle to gain this perspective.</p>


    
                            <p><span>What do you hope for the future of the field?</span></p>
  <p><b>White:</b> I really call on the next generation of up-and-coming Southeast Asian archaeologists to test, fill in, and develop the new paradigm further. I also think that as archaeologists, broadly, we can contribute to a larger discussion of how we all live in this world going forward, to have a more successful existence on this Earth, by studying ancient societies like those in prehistoric Thailand that were enduring, resilient, and peaceful.</p>

      <title>Where’s the Accelerator?</title>
      <link>https://eclecticlight.co/2021/08/08/last-week-on-my-mac-wheres-the-accelerator/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="L">
		<p>Last week I’ve been trying to get to grips with two techniques of making apps go faster on Apple’s new M1 chips: using parallel processing from assembly language, and with features in Apple’s rich and extensive Accelerate libraries. Neither has been straightforward, largely because of documentation.</p>
<p>Arm provides copious documentation on features of its processor designs which include detailed accounts of their instruction sets and architecture, often running to thousands of pages in PDFs of 50 MB and more. The big snag with these, other than their sheer volume, is that they are generic across each processor architecture, and none is specific to the cores which Apple has built into its M1 chip.</p>
<p>So finding out exactly what works and what doesn’t is a journey of exploration. Fascinating though it is, it also takes time, a great deal of browsing of PDFs, and experimentation. If you don’t believe me, then read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple’s terse article</a> and please tell me exactly which of Arm’s reference manuals apply to the cores in the M1. Even Apple shies away from that, providing a link to the top level of Arm’s developer site.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of developers, trying to access the M1 directly is a non-starter, so they look to Apple to facilitate that; in the case of many numeric and related features, those are included in the Accelerate and related libraries. In recent years, Apple has been going out of its way to explain these extensive collections, largely engineered by its Vector &amp; Numerics team.</p>
<p>Members of that team spoke at WWDC in 2018, saying: “Accelerate is easy to use. Most of the time it’s just one function call and the job is done.” The following year they had additional good news: “Accelerate’s libraries are immensely powerful but up until now, their interfaces weren’t that friendly to Swift developers. We’ve looked at four libraries and created new Swift-friendly APIs to make using Accelerate in Swift projects really easy. Please visit our site where we have samples, articles, and extensive reference material that covers the entire Accelerate framework.” They appeared again this year, although their shorter presentation was primarily aimed this time at those using C++.</p>
<p>So I first set off to explore the documentation, as anyone would. From some excellent introductory articles, which whetted my appetite, I decided to look in more detail at several functions, including one which calculates the dot-product of two short vectors. Before you throw your hands up in horror and click on to something more understandable, let me explain that this is little more than basic arithmetic.</p>
<p>For example, if you have two vectors of length 4, containing single-precision floating-point numbers, to calculate their dot-product all you do is multiply the four corresponding pairs of numbers, one from each vector, and add those products together to a total. This may seem dull stuff, but it’s a commonplace requirement, and is highly amenable to processing in parallel.</p>
<p>I therefore opened Xcode’s documentation, found the simd section, and selected the data type I was interested in, Single-Precision Floating-Point Vectors, and this is what I saw.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>I’m pleased to report that the current beta version of Xcode does expand on this with an overview, although that is more confusing still as it states that many functions are provided in three variants, the default, a precise variant, and a fast variant. Then it stops dead without listing or detailing any functions at all.</p>
<p>Maybe, as sometimes happens, the function listing was elsewhere in the documentation. So I searched for the dot-vector call which at least appears in an example. But Xcode’s documentation reported No Results.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>At this stage, one approach is to type in some code and use Xcode’s autocomplete feature with the letters of the alphabet in order to discover which functions that knows about. It’s tedious, but has got me out of a hole on many occasions now. Instead, I turned to that excellent third-party product Dash, which Apple amazingly kicked out of its App Store a couple of years ago, presumably because it was far too useful.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Dash was no different, and its search also drew a blank. So I really was imagining all this after all.</p>
<p>It was then that I went back and re-read the words of one of those engineers, when he referred to “Please visit our site where we have samples” … I found this site <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/working_with_vectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory article</a>, which led me to Apple’s real documentation.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Overlooking the obvious, that what Apple thinks passes for documentation is so minimal as to be embarrassing, why has none of this been incorporated into Xcode? If it’s too expansive to store locally, why doesn’t Xcode link to these online pages?</p>
<p>Having devoted three sessions in recent WWDCs to Accelerate and its relatives like simd, and promised “extensive reference material”, why is Apple not just hiding this light under a bushel, but hiding the bushel too?</p>

It has been there since it was dug up in the 19th century in Sippar, an ancient Babylonian city in what is now Iraq. Only this year, however, has its significance been revealed—by Daniel Mansfield, a mathematician at the University of New South Wales, in Australia. As he describes in <em>Foundations of Science</em>, Dr Mansfield has shown that Si.427 is inscribed with the world’s oldest known example of applied geometry.</p><p>Si.427 seems to have been created by a surveyor defining land boundaries after part of a field was sold. This is, of itself, unremarkable. What is remarkable is that its text describes the use of what are now called Pythagorean triples to draw accurate right angles.</p><p>Pythagorean triples are special cases of Pythagoras’s theorem. They are sets of whole numbers that correspond to the lengths of the sides of particular right-angled triangles. Three, four and five for example, or five, 12 and 13. Another tablet, Plimpton 322, showed many decades ago that the Babylonians knew about these triples. What researchers could not agree on was why they were interested.</p><p>Dr Mansfield’s answer is surveying, for this was a period when agriculture was developing, and with it the idea of land ownership. One way to measure the size of a field is to divide it into rectangles and right-angled triangles, both of which have easily calculated areas. Knowing Pythagorean triples makes drawing the right angles needed to construct these figures easier, and so is useful information. <small>QED</small>.</p><p><em>An early version of this article was published online on August 4th 2021</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline &#34;No need for a protractor&#34;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Processing Semi-Structured Data in the Unix Shell</title>
      <link>http://www.weaselhat.com/2021/06/29/processing-semi-structured-data-in-the-unix-shell/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-936">

<p>The Unix shell is incredibly powerful. I use it routinely for simple tasks (moving files around), routine work (grading scripts), and in my development process (building, deploying, etc.). When I’m working with text, the shell and its ecosystem is excellent: patching together <code>cat</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>tr</code>, and <code>cut</code> with shell pipelines and redirections is a convenient, expressive, and fast way to inspect and edit files.</p>



<p>But my shell toolchain is much less helpful when working with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data">semi-structured data</a>, like JSON and YAML. Folks have made wonderful contributions to the shell ecosystem to help—tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron">gron</a>. These two tools provide new languages for manipulating JSON. It may be embarrassing to admit for a programming languages researcher, but… I’m kind of maxed out on new languages.</p>



<p>So I built a new tool that lets you use your usual shell tools to work with modern file formats: <a href="https://mgree.github.io/ffs/"><code>ffs</code>, the <code>f</code>ile <code>f</code>ile<code>s</code>ystem</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="http://www.weaselhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/inplace_demo.gif"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="318" src="http://www.weaselhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/inplace_demo.gif" alt="A GIF showing the following shell interaction, editing JSON in place.

~/ffs/demo $"/></a><figcaption>Editing JSON in place using ffs.</figcaption></figure>



<p>ffs lets you mount semi-structured data as a filesystem: objects and lists correspond to directories, while other types correspond to regular files. You can mount a file in one format, edit the filesystem, and write it back in another.</p>



<p>All you need to run ffs is FUSE, a kernel module that supports userspace filesystem. You’ll want <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a> on Linux, or <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">macFUSE</a> on macOS. <a href="https://github.com/mgree/ffs/releases">Download a binary</a> and play around!</p>

      <title>Major U.K. science funder to require grantees to make papers immediately free</title>

      <p>The United Kingdom currently has one of the highest rates of open-access publication in the world, with many researchers posting their research papers on websites that make them publicly available for free. But the country’s leading funding agency today announced a new policy that will push open access even further by mandating that all research it funds must be freely available for anyone to read upon publication.</p>

<p>The policy by the funder, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), will expand on existing rules covering all research papers produced from its £8 billion in annual funding. About three-quarters of papers recently published from U.K. universities are open access, and UKRI’s current policy gives scholars two routes to comply: Pay journals for “gold” open access, which makes a paper free to read on the publisher’s website, or choose the “green” route, which allows them to deposit a near-final version of the paper on a public repository, after a waiting period of up to 1 year. Publishers have insisted that an embargo period is necessary to prevent the free papers from peeling away their subscribers.</p>

<p>But starting in April 2022, that yearlong delay will no longer be permitted: Researchers choosing green open access must deposit the paper immediately when it is published. And publishers won’t be able to hang on to the copyright for UKRI-funded papers: The agency will require that the research it funds—with some minor exceptions—be published with a Creative Commons Attribution license (known as CC-BY) that allows for free and liberal distribution of the work.</p>
  
  
  
      <p>UKRI developed the new policy because “publicly funded research should be available for public use by the taxpayer,” says Duncan Wingham, the funder’s executive champion for open research. The policy falls closely in line with those issued by other major research funders, including the nonprofit Wellcome Trust—one of the world’s largest nongovernmental funding bodies—and the European Research Council.</p>

<p>The move also brings UKRI’s policy into alignment with Plan S, an effort led by European research funders—including UKRI—to make academic literature freely available to read. Coalition S, the funders’ group, is “delighted” with the policy, says Executive Director Johan Rooryck. UKRI is a funding heavyweight within Europe, he says, and its push for open access shows there is a “worldwide movement” among big research funders in the same direction. “We are hoping that this will be an example for many other large funders in the world,” Rooryck says, including in China, Japan, and the United States.</p>

<p>Although the requirement for zero-embargo green open access is significant, the policy is still “evolutionary rather than revolutionary,” says David Prosser, executive director of the library consortium Research Libraries UK. It clears up some confusion about when UKRI will pay the fees that journals charge for gold open access, he says: never for journals that offer a mix of paywalled and open-access content, unless the journal is part of an agreement to transition to exclusively open access for all research papers. (More than half of U.K. papers are covered by transitional agreements, according to UKRI.) “This will make it easier for institutions, for authors, and for publishers to know where they stand,” Prosser says. UKRI will nearly double the funding it provides for supporting open access—including gold open-access fees–from £24 million to £47 million per year.</p>

<p>UKRI says it will unveil more details of the policy in November. It has not yet said, for example, whether it will fund gold open-access fees for journals—including <em>Nature</em>—that have made some open-access commitments but are not covered by a full transitional agreement approved by Jisc, a nonprofit U.K. group that negotiates journal subscriptions on behalf of universities. With implementation of the policy still nearly a year away, UKRI thinks there will be enough time that “there will be sufficient, affordable, sustainable choice” for researchers, Wingham says.</p>

<p>Publishers have resisted the new requirements. The Publishers Association, a member organization for the U.K. publishing industry, circulated a document saying the policy would introduce confusion for researchers, threaten their academic freedom, undermine open access, and leave many researchers on the hook for fees for gold open access—which it calls the only viable route for researchers. The publishing giant Elsevier, in a letter sent to its editorial board members in the United Kingdom, said it had been working to shape the policy by lobbying UKRI and the U.K. government, and encouraged members to write in themselves.</p>

<p>Elsevier directed requests for comment on the new policy to the Publishers Association, which released a statement calling green open access unsustainable, particularly for small publishers. “When versions of articles are made available too soon, this undermines the need to subscribe [to journals],” wrote a spokesperson, Amy Price, in an email to <em>Science</em>. It remains to be seen whether some publishers will refuse to publish papers by authors who opt to immediately post a green version of their paper; Price’s email did not respond to a question about that possibility.</p>

<p>It would not be in the interest of publishers to refuse to publish these green open-access papers, Rooryck says, because the public repository version ultimately drives publicity for publishers. And even with a paper immediately deposited in a public repository, the final “version of record” published behind a paywall will still carry considerable value, Prosser says. Publishers who threaten to reject such papers, Rooryck believes, are simply “saber rattling and posturing.”</p>

      <title>Drunk-driver detectors for cars mandated in infrastructure bill</title>

		<div itemprop="articleBody">
						<p><em>U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has pushed for the inclusion of anti-drunk-driver technology for years. (Reuters)</em></p> 
 
<p>New cars will be required to have technology to detect <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/drunk+driving/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:0;">drunk drivers</a> and a system to keep children from being accidentally left in vehicles on hot days under a series of long-sought safety measures included in the infrastructure bill awaiting a vote in the U.S. Senate.</p> 
<p>Other provisions included in the 2,702-page bill are a mandate for automatic emergency <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/brakes/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:1;">braking</a> and crash avoidance systems for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/research/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:2;">new cars</a>, and rear guards for semitrailer <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/truck/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:3;">trucks</a> to keep the passenger compartments of cars from being crushed in rear-impact collisions.</p> 
<p>Jason Levine, executive director of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/center+for+auto+safety/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:4;">Center for Auto Safety</a>, which lobbies for more stringent <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/safety/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:5;">auto safety</a> rules, applauded the inclusion of the measures.</p> 
<p>“There is little question our nation is long overdue for critical updates to our infrastructure, especially when it comes to vehicle safety and the rising tide of preventable car crash deaths,” he said.</p> 
<p>Although people in the U.S. drove less in 2020 because of the pandemic, an estimated 38,680 people died in traffic crashes, which is the highest number of annual deaths since 2007, according to a release from the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/nhtsa/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:6;">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> in June. The number of U.S. traffic deaths rose by 7.2% from the previous year, despite the 13.2% decrease in vehicle miles traveled.</p> 
<p>Backers say the anti-drunk driving provisions in the measure would drastically reduce the number of deaths that occur on U.S. roads.</p> 
<p>“This is the most significant rule-making in <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/nhtsa/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:7;">NHTSA</a>’s history,” Stephanie Manning, government affairs officer for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said. “Every year we wait, thousands of people will die.”</p> 
<p>The provision mirrors legislation that Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has championed for several years. It orders NHTSA to study the feasibility of various technologies and establish a final rule within three years mandating some form of anti-drunk driving technology.</p> 
<h2>Drunk drivers</h2> 
<p>Among the systems that have been studied are ones that monitor a driver for signs of distracted, impaired or fatigued driving. One uses sensors that scan drivers’ eyes for signs that are similar to ones that police officers look for when they suspect impairment during traffic stops.</p> 
<p>“We can’t wait any longer to make our roads safer from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/drunk+driving/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:8;">drunk driving</a> accidents,” Dingell said in a statement. “The inclusion of my bill in the bipartisan infrastructure package will help incentivize the development and implementation of technology to stop drunk driving once and for all and save lives.”</p> 
<p>A measure to combat deaths of children inadvertently left in a car on hot days calls for a “door logic” alert that reminds a driver that a rear door had been opened and closed prior to the engine starting. The alert tells the driver when the engine is turned off to check the back seat.</p> 
<p>Janette Fennell, president of Kids and Car Safety, said she wished the bill had gone further to prevent the accidental deaths of children. Since 1990, she said, more than 1,000 children had died in hot cars.</p> 
<p>“The Senate version is only requesting a reminder system that does not detect anything,” Fennell said. “It does not let you know if there is an actual child in the back seat.”</p> 
<h2>More is needed</h2> 
<p>Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been advocating for more auto safety legislation, said that variations of bills he has introduced are included in the package, including ones related to seat-back failure, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/distracted+driving/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:9;">distracted driving</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/recalls/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0;pos:1;sec:donut-hole;cpos:10;">recalls</a>, but he will still be pushing for more.</p> 
<p>“We must still fight to improve this bill before it becomes law,” Markey said. “That’s why I will be offering several amendments to strengthen my existing safety provisions and remove dangerous proposals that could undermine some of the rules we already have on the books.”</p> 
<p>Any changes to the bill will be difficult and require broad agreement. Amendments will need 60 votes to pass.</p> 
<p>Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said it is important for Congress to address auto safety, but she said she wishes the bipartisan infrastructure measure would have gone even further.</p> 
<p>“The past year and a half has been exceptionally deadly for motorists and other road users,” Chase said in a statement. “This alarming fatal upward trend must be met with the advancement of available, game-changing safety technologies and other upgrades.”</p></div>

   </p><p>Last weekend I <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/staffpad-to-dorico-via-musicxml-alas-no/">noted</a> that I had hit a number of frustrations in trying to jump back and forth between <a href="https://www.staffpad.net">StaffPad</a> and <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/">Dorico</a>, because the Music<abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> handoff between the two was frustrating particularly around percussion — and, spoilers, my orchestral writing makes pretty thorough use of percussion! While I’m still somewhat up in the air where I’ll ultimately land on one or the other as a primary tool — <a href="https://www.scoringnotes.com/podcast/the-history-and-future-of-dorico-for-ipad/">recent news from Dorico</a> having made that a yet more interesting consideration! — but in the meantime I figured it would be interesting to dig into how and why the two differ.</p>
<p>For this post, I’m going to dig into the major ways the applications differ in how they represent a single percussion instrument: Wood Blocks. I picked Wood Blocks because they’re a bit move involved than something like a bass drum or snare drum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are categorized as unpitched percussion, because they do not have <em>definite</em> pitches, but they do have <em>distinct</em> pitches across the blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are always represented as some kind of multiline staff. However, different tools present that staff differently!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>StaffPad uses by a traditional 5-line staff:</p>
  
</li>
<li>
<p>Dorico uses a line-per-block percussion-style staff:</p>
  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not a collection of <em>totally different</em> percussion instruments all grouped together as in a drum kit staff, but the blocks do also have distinct elements to strike in a way that differs from e.g. a piano or a glockenspiel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of differences means that looking at wood blocks will show us most of what we need to know about the underlying differences in the programs’ representations of percussion. We <em>can</em> safely generalize from what we’ll see below!</p>
<h2 id="presentation" tabindex="-1"><a href="#presentation">Presentation</a></h2>
<p>First, notice again the two different visual representations of the instrument:</p>
<p>StaffPad:</p>
<p></p><p>Dorico:</p>
<p></p><p>This gives us our first hint of how the two programs <em>model</em> the instruments differently: StaffPad is treating this as an unpitched instrument in some ways (notice the two-thick-bars start of the staff), but using a pitched-instrument-style staff to represent it. Dorico is doing something totally different, with a single line per block — as if it is representing each wood block as a distinct instrument, but grouped together into a single visual representation. As it turns out, that visual difference (apparent here as it is not necessarily in other, simpler percussion instruments we might have looked at) is <em>exactly</em> what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>What’s more, I have actually cheated a bit here to make these appear more similar than they normally would. By default, Dorico actually presents these with the individual blocks named:</p>
<p></p><p>I went out of my way to create a <a href="https://steinberg.help/dorico_pro/v3.5/en/dorico/topics/setup_mode/setup_mode_percussion_kits_grid_groups_creating_t.html">Group</a> to get the notation as close as possible to StaffPad’s to highlight the difference in presentation of the musical staves, but with the default instrument naming in view it becomes that much more clear: Dorico thinks of each block as a distinct item on unpitched lines, whereas StaffPad thinks of them as a single instrument with unpitched blocks mapped to pitched stave lines, and they present them accordingly.</p>
<p>So how does that translate into the Music<abbr>XML</abbr> each program generates?</p>
<h2 id="musicxml-representation" tabindex="-1"><a href="#musicxml-representation">MusicXML Representation</a></h2>
<p>There are a couple points of interest here. One is how the instruments themselves are defined. Both programs follow the Music<abbr>XML</abbr> spec here, but they represent the instrument quite differently — albeit in a rather unsurprising way, given what we saw above!</p>
<p>Here’s how StaffPad defines the Wood Blocks instrument:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>part-list</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>score-part</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>part-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Blocks<span>&lt;/<span>part-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-I1&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Blocks<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-abbreviation</span>&gt;</span>W.Blocks<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-abbreviation</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-sound</span>&gt;</span>wood.wood-block<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-sound</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>score-part</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>part-list</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s how Dorico defines the Wood Blocks instrument:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>part-list</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>score-part</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>part-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Blocks<span>&lt;/<span>part-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X1&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Block 1<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X2&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Block 2<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X3&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Block 3<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X4&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Block 4<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>score-instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X5&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>Wood Block 5<span>&lt;/<span>instrument-name</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>score-instrument</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>score-part</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>part-list</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The key things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>StaffPad and Dorico both treat this instrument as a single <code>score-part</code>, and in fact it happens to have a matching part <abbr title="identifier">ID</abbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In StaffPad, the Wood Blocks are represented as a <em>single</em> <code>score-instrument</code> within that top-level <code>score-part</code>. In Dorico, each wood block is a separate <code>score-instrument</code> and <code>instrument-name</code> within the <code>score-part</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is what I found last week: The different <em>lines</em> from percussion instruments from StaffPad ended up mapped into multiple different <em>instruments</em> in Dorico.</p>
<p>This continues as we dig into the <code>&lt;part&gt;</code> section of the Music<abbr>XML</abbr> file. A <code>&lt;part&gt;</code> represents each <em>musical part</em> in the score, and holds all the measures which belong to that part. If we look at how the two programs represent the parts, we can see more of why it’s difficult to translate from one to the other.</p>
<p>StaffPad:</p>

  <span>&lt;/<span>measure</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>part</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to notice is in the <code>staff-details</code> definition. Here’s a table showing a quick comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>Element</em></th>
<th><strong>StaffPad</strong></th>
<th><strong>Dorico</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>clef</code></td>
<td><code>percussion</code></td>
<td><code>percussion</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>staves</code></td>
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td><code>1</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>staff-lines</code></td>
<td><code>5</code></td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>transpose</code></td>
<td>default values</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both use <code>percussion</code> for the <code>clef</code> (though Dorico explicitly also specifies a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/musicxml-reference/elements/clef/">clef <code>number</code> attribute</a> here), and set <code>staves</code> to <code>1</code> for this part, as we would expect: <em>most</em> instruments other than a piano, harp, or similar will be single-stave instruments. Beyond this, the two diverge substantially. StaffPad specifies <code>staff-lines</code> (within the <code>staff-details</code> container), but while it <em>could</em> choose to use the <code>line-detail</code> element to represent this exactly the way Dorico does… it <em>doesn’t</em> do that. Instead, it just specifies that there are five staff lines and moves on. Meanwhile, Dorico skips this entirely, because it has encoded the representation of the blocks already: in the <code>part-list</code> at the top. Likewise, Dorico doesn’t specify transposition at all, because it’s not relevant information for this instrument.</p>
<p>This pattern continues when we look at individual notes. Let’s see how each program represents the first note, the lowest wood block. (The rest of the notes are basically identical, just with differences around which block is being struck.)</p>
<p>First, StaffPad:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>note</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>pitch</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>step</span>&gt;</span>G<span>&lt;/<span>step</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>octave</span>&gt;</span>4<span>&lt;/<span>octave</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>pitch</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>duration</span>&gt;</span>192<span>&lt;/<span>duration</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>voice</span>&gt;</span>1<span>&lt;/<span>voice</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>type</span>&gt;</span>quarter<span>&lt;/<span>type</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>note</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now Dorico:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>note</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>unpitched</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>display-step</span>&gt;</span>E<span>&lt;/<span>display-step</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>display-octave</span>&gt;</span>4<span>&lt;/<span>display-octave</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>unpitched</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>duration</span>&gt;</span>4<span>&lt;/<span>duration</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>instrument</span> <span>id</span>=<span>&#34;P1-X5&#34;</span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>voice</span>&gt;</span>1<span>&lt;/<span>voice</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>type</span>&gt;</span>quarter<span>&lt;/<span>type</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>stem</span>&gt;</span>up<span>&lt;/<span>stem</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>staff</span>&gt;</span>1<span>&lt;/<span>staff</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>note</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This time Dorico has far more information, but this is because it is encoding the wood blocks as genuinely unpitched and representing them as separate instruments, as we saw in the <code>part-list</code>. StaffPad is representing that first note as a pitched note: a<span></span> <span>“</span>G4”. Dorico is representing it as an unpitched note which apperas in a particular display note-and-octave of<span></span> <span>“</span>E4”. In this case, while StaffPad’s representation is not unknow of in published music, Dorico’s is definitely the more correct representation. You can also see that as a result of the choice to represent the blocks as individual instruments, Dorico needs to specify the <code>instrument</code> with an <code>id</code> attribute, and to specify the <code>staff</code> number on which the note is set. Those latter bits come<span></span> <span>“</span>for free” for StaffPad because of its choice to use a pitched representation of the note, but at the cost of a representation which has technically-incorrect semantics.</p>
<p>It’s worth pausing here to note that a program could choose an alternative to Dorico’s representation which would <em>also</em> be correct. For example, you could use the <code>line-detail</code> element for the different lines within the stave, and take the same approach with <code>unpitched</code> notes and a <code>display-step</code> and <code>display-octave</code> as Dorico does. (The point is not that Dorico does it correctly — though I think it does — so much as that StaffPad does it slightly <em>incorrectly</em>.) But even so: the format is flexible enough that interop would be hard regardless. It is not obvious to me that Dorico’s import would work any better at all if StaffPad switched to the encoding I described here. This is just a hard problem!</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you’re curious and want to dig in further yourself, I‘ve uploaded both of the Music<abbr>XML</abbr> files used in this discussion; feel free to take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/file/chriskrycho-com/images/dorico-staffpad-musicxml/Wood%20Blocks!%20%E2%80%93%20Staffpad.xml">StaffPad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cdn.chriskrycho.com/file/chriskrycho-com/images/dorico-staffpad-musicxml/Wood%20Blocks!%20%E2%80%93%20Dorico.xml">Dorico</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-what" tabindex="-1"><a href="#so-what">So what?</a></h2>
<p>As we come here to the end, you might be wondering what the point of all of that was. Well, for one thing I hope it’s helpful for other people besides me to see exactly what’s going on in this musical interchange format. Understanding the complexities of these kinds of things can make it easier for people to sympathize with software developers: whose work is very hard!</p>
<p>For another, I started digging into this to see how hard it would be to write a small tool to transform StaffPad’s output into something Dorico will understand. I think the answer is: not <em>too</em> hard! I would need to go through each kind of percussion instrument and make sure it transforms it correctly, but that’s the kind of thing I know how to do from other sorts of <abbr>XML</abbr>-mashing in the past.</p>
<p>While I don’t <em>know</em> that I’ll do that, I now have a pretty good sense of what it would take. It would be some non-trivial amount of work, to be sure; but depending on what my ongoing workflow looks like, it might end up being worth it to me. If it does and I build that tool, I will of course share it here as well as in various forums for the software programs in question. (No promises, though, for real!)</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Juniper Threat Labs continuously monitors in-the-wild network traffic for malicious activity. Today, we have discovered an active exploitation of a vulnerability that was disclosed just 2 days ago.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">CVE-2021-20090 is a path traversal vulnerability that leads to an authentication bypass. When exploited, the attacker can take over control of the affected device.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As of August 5, we have identified some attack patterns that attempt to exploit this vulnerability in the wild coming from an IP address located in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

We had witnessed the same activity starting February 18. The similarity could indicate that the same threat actor is behind this new attack and attempting to upgrade their infiltration arsenal with yet another freshly disclosed vulnerability.

Ukrainian TV channel TRK has sent a rather bizarre takedown request to Google. The company&#39;s anti-piracy partner Vindex asked the search engine to remove a search result that points to 127.0.0.1. Tech-savvy people will immediately recognize that the anti-piracy company apparently found copyright-infringing content on its own server.
</p>
</header>
<div>
<p>While search engines are extremely helpful for the average Internet user, copyright holders also see a massive downside.</p>
<p>The fact that “infringing sites” show up in search results has become a source of frustration. As a result, Google and other search engines are facing a steady stream of DMCA takedown notices.</p>
<p>Google alone has processed more than <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-holders-asked-google-to-remove-5-billion-pirate-links-210206/">five billion takedown requests</a> and millions of new URLs are reported every week. While the majority of these correctly point to problematic links, there are plenty of mistakes too. </p>
<p>Some copyright holders flag perfectly <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/reckless-dmca-takedown-purges-legitimate-websites-from-google-search-210417/">legitimate websites as piracy havens</a>, which others shoot themselves in the foot by targeting their own websites. The latter happened to the webtoon <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/toomics-reports-its-own-website-for-copyright-infringements/">subscription service Toomics</a> just recently. </p>
<h2>Please Take 127.0.0.1 Offline</h2>
<p>This week we saw yet another problematic DMCA notice, which is perhaps even worse. TV channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine_(TV_channel)#:~:text=Ukraine%20(officially%20TRK%20Ukraina%3B%20%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B0,which%20is%20part%20of%20SCM.">TRK Ukraine</a> asked Google to remove content hosted on the IP-address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">127.0.0.1</a>, which is the localhost of a device or server. </p>
<center></center>
<p>The request was sent by TKR’s anti-piracy partner <a href="https://vindex.com.ua/">Vindex</a>, which essentially flagged a file on its own machine. The ‘infringing’ link is 127.0.0.1:6878/ace/manifest.m3u. This points to a playlist file, possibly for the P2P streaming platform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Stream">Ace Stream</a> that’s often used to pirate content. </p>
<h2>‘Illegal Content’</h2>
<p>According to the takedown notice, all reported links “illegally provide external links with which users can access and/or download unauthorized copyrighted contents of Football.” That would then include the file on Vindex’s computer. </p>
<p>Since 127.0.0.1 refers to the host computer, Google is technically asked to remove a file from its servers. A file that doesn’t exist. Needless to say, Google hasn’t taken any action in response.</p>
<p>The above suggests that Vindex may want to take a good look at its takedown bots. The company doesn’t have a stellar reputation when it comes to DMCA notices. Of <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/reporters/27882?request_by_org=size:10;org:27882;p:MzoyNzg4MjoxMDo1MDo2MA&amp;lu=request_by_org">all the links</a> that were reported to Google, little more than 10% were removed by the search engine. </p>

Trump</a>’s political operation had steered huge numbers of unwitting supporters into repeated donations through that tactic.</p><p>The bipartisan commission, which serves as the nation’s top election watchdog agency, is divided evenly between three Democratic-aligned commissioners and three Republicans, a composition that often leads to stalemate. </p><p>But commissioners of both parties, including three Republicans appointed by Mr. Trump, came together on Thursday to ask Congress to strengthen campaign finance law to protect online donors. And within hours, a top Democratic senator who leads the committee that oversees federal elections vowed to introduce legislation to do just that.</p><p>“It’s important that donors be able to exercise their choices freely,” Ellen L. Weintraub, a longtime Democratic commissioner on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/us/politics/fec-democrats-republicans.html" title="">F.E.C.</a>, said in an interview. “If their money is being taken from them because of some reverse checkoff option they didn’t notice, then they are not giving their money freely.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It’s almost like theft,” Ms. Weintraub added. “I don’t want to see donors tricked.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html" title="">The Times investigation</a> showed how the Trump operation, facing a cash crunch last fall, had deployed prechecked boxes to enroll every donor in weekly withdrawals — unless they unchecked the box. Then the Trump operation made the disclaimer that disclosed that fact increasingly opaque with extraneous text. The Trump operation also prechecked a second box, known as a “money bomb,” that doubled a person’s contribution.</p><p>Demands for refunds soared and credit card companies experienced a surge of fraud complaints, the investigation found.</p><p>All told, the Trump operation had to refund more than $122 million to online supporters, 10.7 percent of what it had raised in 2020 through WinRed, the Republican online donation-processing platform. The Biden operation’s overall refund rate on ActBlue, the parallel Democratic donation-processing platform, was 2.2 percent.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, said on Thursday that she would introduce legislation to bar campaigns from using prechecked recurring donation boxes.</p><p>“We must ensure that people who can only contribute small amounts are empowered to make their voices heard — but that will only happen if Americans trust that campaigns aren’t taking advantage of them through tactics like pre-checked recurring donation boxes,” she said in a statement.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In addition to the F.E.C.’s recommendation, Facebook said it was reviewing its policies for advertisers who link to prechecked recurring donation pages.

Adav Noti, who previously worked in the F.E.C. general counsel’s office and is now a litigator with the Campaign Legal Center, said it was notable that any recommendation had been adopted by a commission that is so often stymied by partisanship.</p><p>“It’s pretty rare that they agree on a recommendation related to substantive campaign finance law,” Mr. Noti said. The package of recommendations also includes asking Congress to make clear that no political funds can be used for personal purposes and to crack down on so-called scam PACs that spend little on politics but enrich their operators.</p><p>WinRed, which is the dominant digital donation platform for the Republican Party, allows candidates up and down the ballot to precheck the recurring donation box.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
        
        
        
          <p></p>

<p><em>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than <a href="https://twitter.com/jlemoine_algo?lang=en">Julien Lemoine</a>, Co-founder &amp; CTO of <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the first article in a series.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Search engines, and more generally, information retrieval systems, play a central role in almost all of today’s technical stacks. Information retrieval started in the beginning of computer science. Research accelerated in the early 90s with the introduction of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). After more than 30 years of evolution since TREC, search engines continue to grow and evolve, leading to new challenges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In this article, we look at some key milestones in the evolution of search engine architecture. We also describe the challenges those architectures face today. As you’ll see, we grouped the engines into four architecture categories. This is a simplification, as there are in reality a lot of different engines with various mix of architectures. We did this to focus our attention on the most important characteristics of those architectures.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>1. The Inverted Index —  the early days of search</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the early days of search engines, the first big revolution was the use of </span><span>inverted indexes</span><span>. The word “index” comes from the index that you find at the end of books, which associates a word with the different pages that contain information about the word. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Essentially, a search engine builds a dictionary of every word, where, for each word, it stores and sorts the list of documents that contain the word. Thus, when an end user performs a query with multiple words, the search engine can scan all the words, compute the </span><span>intersection</span><span> (documents that contain all the words), and rank them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All search engines follow this general concept of indexing. Indexing opened a new area of research on how to represent inverted indexes (composed of several inverted lists) in an efficient way. This research led to multiple sets of compression algorithms to efficiently compress and scan those inverted lists containing more and more information.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you’re interested in the way inverted lists are represented, and the different algorithms that can be used, I recommend reading the book </span><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html"><span>Introduction to Information Retrieval</span></a><span> by Christopher D. Manning.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In terms of software architecture, search engines in the early days could be summarized as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>One “indexing process” taking the list of records to compute and producing a binary file representing the inverted index</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>One “query processing” search process interpreting the binary file to compute the intersection of inverted lists for a particular query</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Schema 1: Simple representation of a search architecture (software in blue) </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There was no concept of scaling at this stage. This architecture worked well for small amounts of data. The web expansion in the early 90s, where the volume of data increased rapidly, required a scaling of this architecture.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>2. Introduction of sharding - parallelization</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the early days of the internet, websites were listed manually in a directory. It became obvious after a few years that a manual list could not continue to deal with the increasing number of websites (according to </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/"><span>internet live stats</span></a><span>, the number of websites evolved from 130 websites in 1993, to 23,500 in 1995). Thus began the most popular use case for search engines: web search engines. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In 1993, the first web search engines were introduced. They all had to handle a massive increase in the volume of data in the early 90s. In 1995, when Alta Vista was introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), it was to illustrate the power of their multi-processor 64-bit Alpha servers. It was one of the first, if not the first, fully parallelized search engine able to index the 10M websites that were listed at the time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Parallelization is fairly straightforward to apply to search engines : </span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Instead of having one inverted index with all the documents, you can split the documents in N smaller sets of documents. Each set is called a </span><span>shard</span><span> and contains a subset of the initial document set.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Now you can run the </span><span>indexing</span><span> of all those shards in parallel, producing N smaller inverted indices instead of one big inverted index.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, you can </span><span>search</span><span> in each shard in parallel, producing N queries and aggregating the results to produce the unified result set.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Schema 2: Architecture of a sharded search engine</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The introduction of sharding enabled search engines to treat large volumes of data. In the early days of sharding, the number of shards, and by extension the number of servers, were fixed in advance. Many implementations used a mathematical hashing function to allocate one document to one of the N shards. A document was always allocated to the same shard and therefore will never lead to a duplication of records between the shards.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This shard-based search engine architecture can be summarized as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A fixed number of shards distributed across different servers</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A distributed computation of the inverted index (indexing, one thread per shard)</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A distributed computation of the search results across the different shards (searching, one thread per shard), finalized by a fast merge of the N results</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Some additional comments:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Indexing and searching need to be on the same machine for a given shard (inverted indexes are on local storage).</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are no mechanisms like a distributed commit allowing an indexing operation to be visible on all shards at the same time. For example, if you want to change the list of attributes that you index, or if you want to change your record structure, you will need to create another index, as you cannot do those operations atomically.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>New types of problems crop up when the merge function has to deal with non-algebraic aggregation. An example is collapsing results based on field values (for example, a job board where you want to collapse jobs per company name, and then display the top 10 jobs for each category).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This type of architecture was used during the 90s and even early 2000s. Of course, a lot of refinements and improvements were applied to those architectures to make sure they were able to support the load. For example, batch indexing was quickly replaced by incremental builds of data structures to avoid rebuilding the whole inverted list at each pass (similar to databases). Sharding is a key component of search engines to make them scale. Today, it’s part of all search engine architectures in addition to other principles to reach </span><span>high availability</span><span>, which we describe in the next section.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>3. High Availability and scaling of search - the age of maturity</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Search engines need to scale, to manage large volumes of data and numbers of queries. According to </span><a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm"><span>Internet World Stats</span></a><span>, there were only 16M internet users in 1995, but it grew quickly to reach more than 5B in 2020. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The previous section discussed how to manage large volumes of data with sharding. The next problem is how to manage the large volume of </span><span>queries,</span><span> and the associated high-availability of search (that is, supporting hardware failures).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Solving this problem requires introducing replicas of the inverted shards to be able to answer a query from multiple sets of machines. The general principle is straightforward: we use the same architecture as before, but we have N groups of machines able to answer any query instead of having only one group of machines. Each group of machines contains all the shards to answer any query and the number of replicas can grow or shrink depending on the volume of queries.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The complexity of such architecture is mainly in the replication logic and has the same properties and drawbacks as the previous architecture. The complexity of the replication of inverted indices depends on the format of the data structure on disk. Generational data structures are often optimized to minimize the amount of data transferred. If you’re interested in learning more about the different types of data structure on disk, I recommend reading </span><a href="https://blog.senx.io/demystifying-leveldb/"><span>the description of the LevelDB key value store internals</span></a><span>; the same concept is often applied to search engines.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the architecture is hosted in a public cloud environment, the different groups of machines must be hosted on different availability zones to target a better service level objective (SLO). A load balancer component is required to distribute the queries to the different sets of machines, and to retry on error.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This replica-based search engine architecture has exactly the same characteristics as the previous one, with the addition of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Capacity to handle an infinite amount of queries via replications of the data (increasing capacity takes time, usually hours as it requires copying the inverted indices from the existing machines. This is a good solution only when the increase of traffic can be anticipated.).</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In a multi-provider deployment, the copy of the on-disk data-structure is often replaced by a primary/replicas setup where the indexing operations are transfered. The primary shard receives indexing operations, stores them in a LOG. The LOG is consumed locally by the indexing process and the LOG is replicated to one or several locations. The reason for this setup is that it’s usually faster to replicate the indexing operations instead of the binary files, as the inter-provider bandwidth can be the bottleneck when transferring large binary files.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>4. High Availability of indexing and elasticity - the business critical area</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Given the importance of high-availability of search for all online businesses, it’s crucial to tolerate hardware failure without any business impact. Architectures must manage hardware failure so that it remains transparent to the end user.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The previously discussed architecture introduced the possibility to accept hardware failure without impacting the ability to search. New use cases like Snapshat make indexing a critical piece of the system: Snapshot’s information is ephemeral and needs to be searchable quickly, so the indexing also requires high availability. High availability of indexing was introduced to search engines via different architectures that all have in common that at least two machines can build one shard. The most famous architecture is Elasticsearch, introduced in 2010 with high availability of search and indexing. The most significant innovation Elasticsearch introduced was not the high availability of indexing; it was the elasticity. Elasticity is the ability to add machines to an existing instance and move shards between machines. It was a significant evolution of search engine architectures!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The introduction of high availability of indexing is an evolution of the primary/replicas architecture described in the previous section. Each shard has one primary, thus ensuring a unique ordering of indexing jobs and N replicas. It’s important to ensure that each replica will process the jobs in the same order to converge on the exact same state.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Suppose the machine hosting the primary shard is down. In that case, one replica is elected as the new primary via a </span><span>leader election algorithm</span><span> to ensure a globally consistent state.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To illustrate this, let&#39;s take the following example: </span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>One index containing four shards.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Factor-three replication (three copies of each shard: one primary shard and two replica shards). </span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Distributed over four machines. Each machine contains one primary shard and two replicas.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When an indexing operation comes to the system, a routing phase routes the operation to the correct primary shard. This routing process can be performed by any one of the three machines (so you can target any machine to perform the indexing operation). The indexing process of the primary shard will then replicate the indexing operation on every shard, resulting in the application of the indexing operation on three machines in parallel (schema 3)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Schema 3: Example of an indexing operation for the shard 1 in the case of one index with four shards, a replication factor of three.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A load balancer selects one of the three copies of each shard to perform the query. The three copies allow three times more queries per second than with a single copy of the shard. In this setup, the machines are spread over two availability zones (AZ). Each AZ runs on as many different physical infrastructures as possible inside a cloud-provider region. The three copies are stored in a way where the first copy is 100% hosted on the first AZ, the second copy is 100% hosted on the second AZ, and the third copy is split between the two AZ. Schema 4 illustrates one query sent to the copy that is 100% hosted on the first AZ.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Schema 4: Example of a query processed by the replica, hosted fully on the first AZ</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On each machine, the indexing and the search processes can access all the shards stored locally. The elasticity comes from adding and removing machines to an existing setup. For example, it’s possible to add a new machine to the previous example. The shards would then automatically be moved to the new machine to ensure you have an even-loaded spread on each machine. Depending on the allocation algorithm of your search engine, you can end up with a result similar to schema 5.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The number of shards is static in this architecture. Defining the number of shards is a critical element of your configuration, as it defines the ability to scale and your underlying performance. In this example, the number of shards is not big enough to use all the CPU resources on all machines. Still, you can increase the number of replicas to support more queries per second and use all resources, which is the standard way to scale.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It’s also important not to have too many shards. The goal is to process all of them in parallel. If you do not have enough CPU threads for all shards at the same time, it will negatively impact your response time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Schema 5: Example after the addition of a new machine in the second availability zone</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are two types of failures that this architecture can support while keeping all shards available:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>One machine is down. This would have no impact on the ability to index and search. There are enough replicas to ensure we can still perform a search query. The leader election will elect one of the two replicas as master. The only impact would be to reduce the search capacity because fewer CPU threads are available for search.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>One AZ is down. In this case, the search would still be available with less capacity to scale. Indexing would be unavailable for two shards as only one of the three copies remains, which prevents a leader election.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This type of architecture is today’s state of the art in search architecture, with the following characteristics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ability to scale in terms of data depending on the number of shards you configured</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ability to scale in terms of volume of queries by adding new replicas</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ability to tolerate hardware failure and availability zone (AZ) failure to some extent</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>5. Next steps — the current challenges of search engines</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The latest generation of architecture is now more than ten years old! Since then, fast-growing marketplaces and SaaS applications have put many constraints on those architectures. It’s now time to design the next generation of architecture for the next ten years, solving the following challenges:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sub-minute addition/removal of machines</span><span>. We already know how to </span><span>add/remove machines from an existing instance. However, we need to go one step further to support dynamic scalability: the ability to add or remove machines in under a minute and the ability to temporarily handle the increased traffic before the new machine is available! Search engines today are more than ever required to anticipate growth, and scale their infrastructure for spikes of traffic. Total dynamic scalability will allow everyone to be more cost efficient while unlocking new creative usage of search engines. For example, one big marketplace presented the idea of a flash sale on their store leveraging the search engine: customers have to find a cheap product hidden in their large catalogue. You can imagine the flood of queries their search engine received just after they sent an email to millions of users, their last event generated 160 times more traffic than their average daily traffic. But the same happens every time some search event goes viral, which is usually impossible to plan for in advance.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A dynamic number of shards</span><span>. The number of shards is a critical factor of performance and ability to scale. To be optimum, this number would need to change often. The next generation of search engine architectures will allow you to change this number dynamically. It will also need to go further, where the engine tunes this number automatically to ensure you always have the optimum performance and ability to scale.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Separation of search and indexing</span><span>. Scaling both in terms of volume of queries and volume of data is the most demanding situation for a search engine. It’s a problem for many use cases like marketplaces. In such a situation, the cost of infrastructure can quickly become prohibitive if you perform the indexing for each replica. Increasing the search or indexing capacity impacts the resource consumption of the existing machines. For example, when the system is already loaded, scaling one of the subsystems can make the whole system collapse. The next generation will have high availability of search and indexing while doing only a one-time indexing job for each shard. It will scale indexing and search separately, avoiding any negative impact of indexing on search.</span></p>

Today, you have access to up to 100 Gbps network links in a public cloud provider, and it will become more and more the norm. The CPU and storage improvements were much more limited in the same period than the 100X factor on the bandwidth! Leveraging such network architecture requires a very different data transfer usage with more parallelization.

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
  <p>The current pandemic has made everyone think a lot more about viruses than they ever had any desire to, but they’re a constant background to our lives – and to the lives of pretty much every living creature. Humans have their viruses, other mammals have theirs (with occasional catastrophic overlaps), and birds, reptiles, and fish all have their own as well. Worms, ocean sponges, mollusks, insects – they all have their suite of viruses that infect them, all the way down to the phages that attack bacteria. Plants of all kinds have their own viral load as well. This is what things look like after a couple of billion years of evolutionary competition; viruses are too successful at what they do to not be everywhere.</p>
<p>We’ve also all had to learn a lot more than we ever wanted to about our defense mechanisms against these things, and I wanted to highlight an odd feature of one of those today, as seen in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00829-z">this paper</a>. When you’re infected with an RNA virus, one of the common counterattacks is through RNAse enzymes, which attempt to break down the foreign sequences. They break down a lot of our own RNA molecules as well, of course – many types of RNA have a rather short half-life in the cell, and if you need them to last longer, you have to work in some special features.</p>
<p>Viruses have long since stumbled onto those sorts of trick as well, of course: an RNA virus whose genetic material isn’t degraded so quickly by host defenses has an obvious advantage. One of the things that dodges RNAse activity is for the RNA molecule itself to be oddly shaped and knotted. These sequences (exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs, or xrRNAs) have been elaborated over the years to the point that some viruses use them both as protection and as a means to have host RNAse enzymes directed to places where the RNA needs to be cut anyway! Viruses travel light. Any work that can be offloaded onto the host cell generally is.</p>
<p>The flaviviruses were the first family seen to be taking advantage of these effects (although they’ve since been noticed in other types of viruses as well). That one’s pretty high-profile, though: yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya and dengue are all caused by pathogens in this group. Zika, for example, has an interesting knotted structure in one region of its RNA that causes a whole range of incompletely broken-down RNA species to form when the host cell RNAses try to digest it. These things pile up inside the cell and start disrupting all sorts of other cellular processes in turn (such as the ones that respond to viral attack!) making for a more successful infection.</p>
<p>You always have to guard your thinking about these things, of course. Our brains have a bias towards imputing agency to things – it’s how we model behavior of threats like animals (including other humans), and it’s a valuable heuristic indeed. But it also makes us think that Zeus or whoever is trying to zap us with lightning bolts, that hurricanes steer into godless dens of sinners that deserved it anyway, and that the reason the NMR sample changer dropped three hours worth of tubes onto the floor last night is because the robot hates you and wants your experiments to fail. Viruses are not planning out their strategies. They mutate and wander and stumble and putz around randomly until something works a bit better to make Moar Virus, and then that Moar Virus change, whatever the hell it was, gradually becomes more common in the population. We’re seeing the end result of who knows how many epochs of such mutations, all done under the pressure of host organism counterattacks, so it looks pretty impressive by now. The fact that we don’t see the untold, unknowable number of misfires also helps. It’s the same strategy that astrologers and fortunetellers use on purpose: make the most out of your successes and sweep all the failures out of sight. If at first you don’t succeed, destroy all evidence that you even tried. Virus success is obvious and rises quickly to the top; virus failures vanish.</p>
<p>The paper linked above looks at one of the knots in Zika viruses, by the high-tech means of attaching chemical handles to each end of the knot and capturing those in optical traps. This allows you to pull on the ends in a very controlled fashion and to get a profile of the unraveling as it takes place on a single RNA molecule. Here’s what they find:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>By measuring the extension of the xrRNA as its structure changed, we identified intermediates in the folding and deduced their structures. We found that the core of the native fold was very resistant to mechanical unfolding, but achieving this extreme resistance required a specific sequence of steps in the folding: formation first of a three-helix junction, then threading of the 5′ end into a cleft in this junction and stabilization by tertiary contacts, before closure of the ring around the threaded 5′ end by a PK.</em></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>So when we say that there’s a knot in the RNA, that is exactly what’s going on, and these knots – like the ones you’d tie with rope – have a particular topology and a particular series of steps to get them tied correctly. The structure of this one is shown in schematic at right, and you can see that 5′ end stuck back in through that cleft. The RNAse enzymes obviously don’t quite know what to make of this, since many of them start digesting from the 5′ end and run smack into the knot. What this paper found, though, is that all knots are not created equal. It appears that just forming any old knot is insufficient by itself to fight off the RNAses, but this Zika one has much high mechanical resistance to being pulled apart than usual, and that’s the key feature. The authors are planning to test this idea with RNA knots from other viruses. Perhaps in another few million years an RNAse will show up that will be able to deal with these things, and things will move on.</p>
<p>If I had to pick one thing about cell biology from my undergraduate education – heck, my graduate education – that has utterly changed over the years, it would be the wild functional and structural variety of RNA molecules that have been uncovered. RNAs in general can form a bewildering number of structures, and only a fool would think that we’ve come to the end of them. And there are surely useful things that we could make that nature has never quite gotten around to finding a use for, either!</p>

The eBPF VM uses a simple instruction set that uses eleven* 64-bit registers, a program counter, and a 512 byte fixed-size stack. Nine registers are general purpose read-write, one is a read-only stack pointer and the program counter is implicit <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/04/15/an-ebpf-overview-part-2-machine-and-bytecode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a><em>.</em> The instruction set is similar to x86, and operates on both 64 and 32 bit values.</span></p><pre id="viewer-2rd7i"><span><span>BPF_MOV64_IMM</span><span>(</span><span>BPF_REG_0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

</span></p><p id="viewer-1pni9"><span>A user mode application loads the bytecode into the kernel using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>bpf()</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>[14]</u></a> syscall, where the eBPF verifier will perform a number of checks to ensure the program is “safe” to run in the kernel. This verification step is critical - eBPF exposes a path for unprivileged users to execute in ring0. </span></p><p id="viewer-3og58"><span>After the program is loaded, the user mode application attaches the program to a “hook point”. A hook point is a place in the kernel where eBPF programs can be attached <a href="https://blog.stackpath.com/bpf-hook-points-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a>. eBPF programs are event driven, meaning the program will execute when certain events occur at the hook point. The classic use case is attaching an eBPF program to a socket, where the program will execute when data is written to it. </span></p><p id="viewer-ck6k4"><span>If the <span><span>kconfig</span></span>  knob <span><span>CONFIG_BPF_JIT</span></span>  is set, the eBPF program is JIT compiled into native assembly instructions after it is verified and loaded. Otherwise, when the program is executed it is run in the eBPF interpreter which decodes and executes the eBPF bytecode instructions. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-5smvr"><span>User mode applications can interact with and get data from the eBPF program running in the kernel using eBPF maps and eBPF helper functions, which are accessed via the  <span> <span>bpf()</span> </span> syscall.</span></p><div id="viewer-b68"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-c99tc"><span>The <span><span> </span><span>sysctl</span><span> </span></span> knob <span><span> kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled </span></span> determines whether unprivileged users are allowed to run eBPF programs. If it is not set, unprivileged users are allowed to attach an eBPF program to a socket that the user owns. In many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, 
<span><span> unprivileged_bpf_disabled </span></span> is not enabled by default. Because of this, I decided to look into eBPF more closely, as allowing unprivileged users to run code in the kernel is a ripe attack surface. 

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-drpfr"><span>eBPF Maps</span></h3><p id="viewer-2geru"><span>I mentioned above that user mode processes can interact with a eBPF program in the kernel using eBPF maps. They can also be used by multiple eBPF programs to interact with each other. They are a generic key/value store with an arbitrary data structure <a href="https://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/ebpf_maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>. There are various types of maps including: arrays, queues, and stacks.  </span></p><p id="viewer-elj25"><span>A map is described by five different attributes:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-a2242"><p><span><span> type </span></span>- the data structure of the map</p></li><li id="viewer-dj88p"><p><span><span> key_size </span></span> - the size in bytes of the key used to index an element (used in array maps)</p></li><li id="viewer-13j8g"><p><span><span> value_size </span></span> - the size in bytes of each element </p></li><li id="viewer-f0a3i"><p><span><span> max_entries </span></span> - the maximum number of entries in the map</p></li><li id="viewer-16hrf"><p><span><span> map_flags </span></span> - describes special characteristics of the map, such as if the entire map memory should be preallocated or not.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-t0aj"><span>eBPF maps can be created and altered from user space via the <span><span> bpf() </span></span> syscall using the 
<span><span> BPF_MAP_CREATE </span></span> command, updated using the <span><span> BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM </span></span> command, and retrieve its contents using the <span><span> BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM </span></span> command. eBPF maps can accessed by eBPF programs using the file descriptor returned by <span><span> BPF_MAP_CREATE </span></span> and calling eBPF helper functions, which will return pointers to values within the map. </span></p><h3 id="viewer-et7e3"><span>The eBPF Verifier</span></h3><p id="viewer-7pl2n"><span>The exploit I wrote leverages a bug in the eBPF verifier. So before I delve into the vulnerability it is important to briefly explain the internals of the verifier.  </span></p><p id="viewer-ftr7c"><span>The verifier starts by building a control flow graph of the program. Then, it will verify each instruction is valid and all memory accesses are safe through each possible flow of control <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00185.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>. Afterwards, it will add in runtime checks to the program. This process, called <strong>ALU Sanitation</strong>, inserts patches to the eBPF bytecode to ensure permitted memory ranges are not violated during runtime when performing pointer arithmetic <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-3gd60"><span>The verifier tries to enforce these general set of rules:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-fh0gi"><p>No back edges, loops, or unreachable instructions.</p></li><li id="viewer-62o7n"><p>No pointer comparisons can be performed, and only scalar values can be added or subtracted to a pointer. A scalar value in the eBPF verifier is any value that is not derived from a pointer.

I specifically say “when writing exploits”, because there are many tools available to help write and debug eBPF programs for legitimate uses, via emulation. One such tool is <a href="https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rbpf</a><a href="https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a href="https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a>, which is a Rust user space virtual machine for eBPF. However, because I exploited a bug in the eBPF verifier, it was important to be able to debug it directly in the kernel to replicate the exact behavior. Additionally, I wrote the bytecode by hand (as opposed to using a toolchain to compile a program into bytecode) so it made using these tools less practical.

If it is not large enough, <strong>loading the program will fail. This will occur even if the program is valid and passes the verifier checks</strong>. This can occur if you are loading a long program, as the verifier prints output for every instruction on each path it traverses. I ran into this issue while writing my exploit, so I thought it was worth noting.

Triggering the Vulnerability</span></h3><p id="viewer-veg4"><span>The specifics of the bug were covered in the Vulnerability section. Here, I will go through the bytecode triggers the bug.

</span></p><p id="viewer-aqg9p"><span>Remember, we need two registers with <span><span> tnum </span></span>s in the same state as shown in the example. That is, one register with <span><span> var_off = {mask = 0xFFFFFFFF00000000; value = 0x1} </span></span> and one with <span><span> var_off = {mask = 0x0; value = 0x100000002} </span></span>. </span></p><p id="viewer-2sp08"><span>The latter is easy. Since all the bits are known, we can load the register with the constant value. We will store this value in arbitrary register referred to as <span><span> CONST_REG </span></span>. Due to the instruction op size, we are restricted to working with 32 bit values. We create the 64 bit value (0x100000002) across a few instructions:</span></p><pre id="viewer-8thto"><span><span>// Load 1 into the register</span>
<span>BPF_MOV64_IMM</span><span>(</span><span>CONST_REG</span><span>,</span> <span>0x1</span><span>)</span>

We can start with a value that is unknown to the verifier, meaning that all the bits of <span><span> mask </span></span> are set. The most straightforward way to do this is to load a value from a eBPF map. This way, we can also control the actual value at runtime, which will become useful later. First, we need to retrieve a pointer an eBPF map we create prior to loading the program, which has file descriptor  <span><span> store_map_fd </span></span>. </span></p><pre id="viewer-2obve"><span><span>// Load a pointer to the store_map_fd map into R1. </span>

Here he details the LPE exploitation strategy he used in Pwn2Own 2020. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-2bb5q"><span>Interestingly, this bypass was not needed at the time of the 2020 competition. When testing my exploit, I found that it was failing on some newer (but still vulnerable) Ubuntu kernels. The reason was because I was not  bypassing ALU Sanitation. During my initial research period I looked at many different public eBPF verifier exploits. Strangely, I didn’t see an ALU Sanitation bypass in any of them!

</span></p><p id="viewer-8ig1g"><span>After some investigation I discovered the reason. There was an integer underflow bug was when calculating the <span><span> alu_limit </span></span> in the verifier.  It was present until March 2021, and fixed in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this commit</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[17]</a>.

</span></p><p id="viewer-1degh"><span>The bug is triggered when <span><span> alu_limit = 0 </span></span>. An example case is doing a subtraction operation with a pointer at the start of a map.</span></p><p id="viewer-bmkp8"><span>The sanitation instruction that was patched in:</span></p><pre id="viewer-soiq"><span><span>*</span>patch<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>BPF_MOV32_IMM</span><span>(</span><span>BPF_REG_AX</span><span>,</span> aux<span>-</span><span>&gt;</span>alu_limit <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></pre><p id="viewer-2mkka"><span>Subtracting 1 from 0 results in <span><span> aux→alu_limit = 0xFFFFFFFF </span></span>. </span></p><p id="viewer-b72lu"><span>The strategy for eBPF exploits depends on modifying the <span><span> bpf_map </span></span> structure found in the memory chunk before the map’s memory. This is done by subtracting from a map pointer. </span></p><p id="viewer-9hn60"><span>ALU Sanitation was rendered completely useless by this bug against exploits of this type, and it went unnoticed even though many PoCs were publicly available. Of course, ALU Sanitation can be easily bypassed regardless.  The new implementation of ALU Sanitation is much more effective against these attacks, which I will go over in the Mitigations section. 

</span></p><h3 id="viewer-e6t4f"><span>Finishing Up the LPE

</span></h3><p id="viewer-dp0cs"><span>We have established the primitive, a register <span><span> EXPLOIT_REG </span></span> which the verifier believes to be 0 but is actually equal to 1 at runtime. The next steps are beautifully outlined in Manfred Paul’s <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/chompie1337/Linux_LPE_eBPF_CVE-2021-3490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released PoC</a> to see the implementation. </span></p><p id="viewer-68bdk"><span><a href="https://youtu.be/EtQieYKtTY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>https://youtu.be/EtQieYKtTY8</em></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-b66k6"><span>Mitigations</span></h2><h3 id="viewer-bg2nv"><span>Unprivileged eBPF

</span></h3><p id="viewer-7d1em"><span>As mentioned in the introduction, running eBPF programs can be disallowed for unprivileged users by setting the <span><span> sysctl </span></span> knob  <span><span>	kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled </span></span>. In May 2021, a new <span><span> kconfig </span></span> knob, <span><span> BPF_UNPRIV_DEFAULT_OFF </span></span>,  was introduced that sets the 
 <span><span> sysctl </span></span> knob  by default <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg740795.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-fm4eh"><span>Enabling these configurations will protect against attacks by disallowing unprivileged users from [ab]using eBPF.  However, this doesn’t mitigate the problem completely. A privileged user can still use the arbitrary kernel write in this exploit to bypass or disable kernel security modules like SELinux. </span></p><h3 id="viewer-eit7c"><span>ALU Sanitation</span></h3><p id="viewer-93mq3"><span>As of April 2021, the implementation of ALU Sanitation has changed <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/commit/?id=7fedb63a8307dda0ec3b8969a3b233a1dd7ea8e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[15]</a>. The new implementation helps mitigate attacks like the one demonstrated in this blog. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-39o1"><span>First, the way <span><span>alu_limit</span></span>  is calculated has changed. Now, instead of using the position of the pointer register to compute it, the offset register is used instead. For example, suppose we have some register with unsigned bounds <span><span>umax_value = 1, umin_value = 0</span></span>.  Then, the computed <span><span>alu_limit = 1</span></span>. This means that if the register is outside of those bounds during runtime, pointer arithmetic does not occur using that register.</span></p><p id="viewer-40gge"><span>Additionally, ALU sanitation now patches pointer operation instructions if the scalar register is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c9e73e3d2b1eb1ea7ff068e05007eec3bd8ef1c9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L12376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known to be constant</a>.  </span></p><pre id="viewer-2qh7c"><span>bool off_is_imm <span>=</span> <span>tnum_is_const</span><span>(</span>off_reg<span>-</span><span>&gt;</span>var_off<span>)</span><span>;</span>

If it is constant, the operation is patched with an immediate instruction using its <em>constant value.</em> </span></p><p id="viewer-baqrm"><span>Here’s an example.

While this will make exploiting vulnerabilities like <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2021-3490</a> harder,  I do not think this will be the end of exploitation with eBPF. I’ll discuss this further in the next section. </span></p><h2 id="viewer-bhgnb"><span>Future Considerations</span></h2><p id="viewer-dptd0"><span>Since the introduction of eBPF, there have been a number of privilege escalation attacks that leverage the technology. In addition to exploiting vulnerabilities in eBPF itself, it also represents a powerful primitive for exploiting other kernel vulnerabilities. While eBPF can be a great tool for developers, there’s still more work to be done to harden it further.</span></p><p id="viewer-1nl1o"><span>Despite the new mitigations discussed in the ALU Sanitation section, exploits like the one demonstrated in the DoS exploitation section will still work. Patching dead code branches with exit instructions instead of jump backwards would prevent these type of attacks. 

</span></p><p id="viewer-35l9k"><span>An LPE exploit writeup by Qualys published in July 2021 uses a memory corruption vulnerability to overwrite an eBPF program buffer, which contains the eBPF bytecode for a loaded program. Instead of fooling the verifier, the program is valid and passes verification. The buffer is overwritten after verification but before JIT compilation to achieve OOB read/write capabilities <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a>. As this exploit demonstrates, the window after validation and before JIT compilation is not small, and a race can be won to target a write. The eBPF program buffer memory should be marked read-only before verification, so that it can&#39;t be modified during verification, and stay read-only until JIT compilation.  This would prevent eBPF from being used as a powerful primitive when exploiting kernel memory corruption vulnerabilities.

<p>Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) was perhaps the most divisive philosopher of the twentieth century. Many hold him to be the most original and important thinker of his era. Others spurn him as an obscurantist and a charlatan, while still others see his reprehensible affiliation with the Nazis as a reason to ignore or reject his thinking altogether. But Heidegger’s undoubted influence on contemporary philosophy and his unique insight into the place of technology in modern life make him a thinker worthy of careful study.</p>



<p>In his landmark book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Being-Time-Martin-Heidegger/dp/0061575593/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=thenewatl-20"><i>Being and Time</i></a> (1927), Heidegger made the bold claim that Western thought from Plato onward had forgotten or ignored the fundamental question of what it means for something <i>to b</i><i>e</i> — to be present for us prior to any philosophical or scientific analysis. He sought to clarify throughout his work how, since the rise of Greek philosophy, Western civilization had been on a trajectory toward nihilism, and he believed that the contemporary cultural and intellectual crisis — our decline toward nihilism — was intimately linked to this forgetting of being. Only a rediscovery of being and the realm in which it is revealed might save modern man.</p>



<p>In his later writings on technology, which mainly concern us in this essay, Heidegger draws attention to technology’s place in bringing about our decline by constricting our experience of things as they are. He argues that we now view nature, and increasingly human beings too, only technologically — that is, we see nature and people only as raw material for technical operations. Heidegger seeks to illuminate this phenomenon and to find a way of thinking by which we might be saved from its controlling power, to which, he believes, modern civilization both in the communist East and the democratic West has been shackled. We might escape this bondage, Heidegger argues, not by rejecting technology, but by perceiving its danger.</p>

	<h5>
		Heidegger’s Life and Influence	</h5>
</div></div>


<p><span>T</span>he son of a sexton, Martin Heidegger was born in southern Germany in 1889 and was schooled for the priesthood from an early age. He began his training as a seminary student, but then concentrated increasingly on philosophy, natural science, and mathematics, receiving a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Freiburg. Shortly after the end of the Great War (in which he served briefly near its conclusion), he started his teaching career at Freiburg in 1919 as the assistant to Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology. Heidegger’s courses soon became popular among Germany’s students. In 1923 he began to teach at the University of Marburg, and then took Husserl’s post at Freiburg after Husserl retired from active teaching in 1928. The publication of <i>Being and Time</i> in 1927 had sealed his reputation in Europe as a significant thinker.</p>



<p>Heidegger’s influence is indicated in part by the reputation of those who studied under him and who respected his intellectual force. Hannah Arendt, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hans Jonas, Jacob Klein, Karl Löwith, and Leo Strauss all took classes with Heidegger. Among these students, even those who broke from Heidegger’s teachings understood him to be the deepest thinker of his time. Although he became recognized as the leading figure of existentialism, he distanced himself from the existentialism of philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre. In Heidegger’s view, they turned his unique thought about man’s being in the world into yet another nihilistic assertion of the dominance of human beings over all things. He insisted that terms such as anxiety, care, resoluteness, and authenticity, which had become famous through <i>Being and Time</i>, were for him elements of the “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060637633?tag=the-new-atlantis-20">openness of being</a>” in which we find ourselves, not psychological characteristics or descriptions of human willfulness, as some existentialists understood them.</p>



<p>Heidegger’s intellectual reputation in the United States preceded much direct acquaintance with his work because of the prominence of existentialism and the influence of his students, several of whom had fled Germany for the United States long before translators began producing English editions of his important works. (<i>Being and Time</i> was first translated in 1962.) Arendt in particular, who had immigrated to America in the early 1940s, encouraged the introduction of her teacher’s work into the United States. Heidegger’s most popular if indirect significance was during existentialism’s heyday from the end of the Second World War until its nearly simultaneous apotheosis and collapse on the hazy streets of San Francisco. Late Sixties Be-Ins — mass gatherings in celebration of American counterculture — appropriated existentialist themes; Heidegger’s intellectual rigor had been turned into mush, but it was still more or less recognizably Heideggerian mush. Herbert Marcuse, a hero to the more intellectual among the Sixties gaggle, was an early student of Heidegger’s, and his books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807015555?tag=thenewatl-20"><i>Eros and Civilization</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807014176?tag=thenewatl-20"><i>One-Dimensional Man</i></a> owe something to him, if more to Freud and, especially, Marx.</p>



<p>After the 1960s, Heidegger’s intellectual radicalism became increasingly domesticated by the American academy, where wild spirits so often go to die a lingering bourgeois death. His works were translated, taught, and transformed into theses fit for tenure-committee review. Still, Heidegger’s influence among American philosophy professors has remained limited (although not entirely negligible), since most of them are, as Nietzsche might say, essentially gastroenterologists with a theoretical bent. Heidegger became more influential, though usually indirectly, for the ways artists and architects talk about their work — no one can conjure a “built space” quite as well as Heidegger does, for instance in his essay “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060937289?tag=thenewatl-20">Building Dwelling Thinking</a>.” And much of Heidegger can also be heard in the deconstructionist lingo of literary “theory” that over the past forty years has nearly killed literature. The result is that “Heidegger” is now a minor academic industry in many American humanities departments, even as he remains relatively unappreciated by most professional philosophers.</p>



<p>But Heidegger’s influence is not only limited by the lack of respect most of our philosophy professors have toward his work. More troubling for many both within and outside the academy is Heidegger’s affiliation with the Nazis before and during the Second World War. His mentor Edmund Husserl was dismissed from the University of Freiburg in 1933 because of his Jewish background. Heidegger became rector of the university in that same year, and joined the Nazi party, of which he remained a member until the end of the war. Even though he resigned the rectorship after less than a year and distanced himself from the party not long after joining, he never publicly denounced the party nor publicly regretted his membership. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226664414/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0226664414&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thenewatl-20">He is said to have once remarked</a> privately to a student that his political involvement with the Nazis was “the greatest stupidity of his life.”) After the war, on the recommendation of erstwhile friends such as Karl Jaspers, he was banned by the Allied forces from teaching until 1951.</p>



<p>For obvious reasons, some of Heidegger’s friends and followers have, from the end of the war to the present day, obfuscated the relationship between Heidegger’s thought and his politics. They are surely aided in this by Heidegger’s masterful ambiguity — for him it really does depend on what the meaning of the word “is” is. His admirers do not want his work to be ignored preemptively because of his affiliation with the Nazis. Heidegger, after all, was not Hitler’s confidant, or an architect of the war and the extermination camps, but a thinker who engaged in several shameful actions toward Jews, and for a time supported the Nazis publicly, and thought he could lead the regime intellectually.</p>



<p>This matter has come under renewed attention with the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Release-of-Heidegger-s/144897/forceGen=1">recent release of Heidegger’s “Black Notebooks,”</a> which are a kind of philosophical diary he kept in the 1930s and 1940s and whose contents fill a six-hundred-page volume. In his will, Heidegger had requested that these notebooks not be published until after the rest of his extensive work was released. The notebooks’ editor, Peter Trawny, reports that they contain hostile references to “world Jewry” that indicate “that anti-Semitism tied in to his philosophy.” Careful study of these notebooks will be required to determine whether they in fact provide new evidence of Heidegger’s anti-Semitism and affiliation with the Nazis that is even more damning than what is already widely known. No one who has examined Heidegger is surprised by what has been reported. But the question still remains whether Heidegger’s thought and politics are intrinsically linked, or whether, as his apologists would have it, his thought is no more (and in fact, less) related to his politics than it is to his interest in soccer and skiing. In truth, it would be surprising if the connection between the philosophy and the political beliefs and actions of a thinker of Heidegger’s rank were simply random.</p>



<p>In fact, Heidegger’s association with the Nazis was far from accidental. One of his infamous remarks on politics was a statement about the “inner truth and greatness” of National Socialism that he made in a 1935 lecture course. In a 1953 republication of that speech as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Metaphysics-Edition-Martin-Heidegger/dp/0300186126/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=thenewatl-20"><i>Introduction to Metaphysics</i></a>, Heidegger appended a parenthetical clarification, which he claimed was written but not delivered in 1935, of what he believed that “inner truth and greatness” to be: “the encounter between global technology and modern humanity.” Some scholars, taking the added comment as a criticism of the Nazis, point to Heidegger’s explanation, following the speech’s publication, that the meaning of the original comment would have been clear to anyone who understood the speech correctly. But perhaps we should not be surprised to find a thinker so worried about “global technology” affiliating with the Nazi Party in the first place. The Nazis were opposed to the two dominant forms of government of the day that Heidegger associated with “global technology,” communism and democracy. In another of Heidegger’s infamous political remarks, made in that same 1935 lecture, he claimed that “Russia and America, seen metaphysically, are both the same: the same hopeless frenzy of enchained technology and of the rootless organization of the average man.” The Nazi’s rhetoric about “blood and soil” and the mythology of an ancient, wise, and virtuous German <i>Volk</i> might also have appealed to someone concerned with the homogenizing consequences of globalization and technology. More broadly, Heidegger’s thought always was and remained illiberal, tending to encompass all matters, philosophy and politics among them, in a single perspective, ignoring the freedom of most people to act independently. The ways in which liberal democracies promote excellence and useful competition were not among the political ideas to which Heidegger’s thought was open. His totalizing, illiberal thought made his joining the Nazis much more likely than his condemning them.</p>



<p>The study of Heidegger is both dangerous and difficult — the way he is taught today threatens to obscure his thought’s connection to his politics while at the same time transforming his work into fodder for the aimless curiosity of the academic industry. Heidegger would not be surprised to discover that he is now part of the problem that he meant to address. But if, as Heidegger hoped, his works are to help us understand the challenges technology presents, we must study him both carefully and cautiously — carefully, to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, and cautiously, in light of his association with the Nazis.</p>





<p>Heidegger’s concern with technology is not limited to his writings that are explicitly dedicated to it, and a full appreciation of his views on technology requires some understanding of how the problem of technology fits into his broader philosophical project and phenomenological approach. (Phenomenology, for Heidegger, is a method that tries to let things show themselves in their own way, and not see them in advance through a technical or theoretical lens.) The most important argument in <i>Being and Time</i> that is relevant for Heidegger’s later thinking about technology is that theoretical activities such as the natural sciences depend on views of time and space that narrow the understanding implicit in how we deal with the ordinary world of action and concern. We cannot construct meaningful distance and direction, or understand the opportunities for action, from science’s neutral, mathematical understanding of space and time. Indeed, this detached and “objective” scientific view of the world restricts our everyday understanding. Our ordinary use of things and our “concernful dealings” within the world are pathways to a more fundamental and more truthful understanding of man and being than the sciences provide; science flattens the richness of ordinary concern. By placing science back within the realm of experience from which it originates, and by examining the way our scientific understanding of time, space, and nature derives from our more fundamental experience of the world, Heidegger, together with his teacher Husserl and some of his students such as Jacob Klein and Alexandre Koyré, helped to establish new ways of thinking about the history and philosophy of science.</p>



<p>Heidegger applies this understanding of experience in later writings that are focused explicitly on technology, where he goes beyond the traditional view of technology as machines and technical procedures. He instead tries to think through the <i>essence of technology</i> as a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything. Heidegger’s most influential work on technology is the lecture “The Question Concerning Technology,” published in 1954, which was a revised version of part two of a four-part lecture series he delivered in Bremen in 1949 (his first public speaking appearance since the end of the war). These Bremen lectures have recently been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0253002311?tag=the-new-atlantis-20">translated into English</a>, for the first time, by Andrew J. Mitchell.</p>



<p>Introducing the Bremen lectures, Heidegger observes that because of technology, “all distances in time and space are shrinking” and “yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance.” The lectures set out to examine what this nearness is that remains absent and is “even warded off by the restless removal of distances.” As we shall see, we have become almost incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone understanding it, because all things increasingly present themselves to us as technological: we see them and treat them as what Heidegger calls a “standing reserve,” supplies in a storeroom, as it were, pieces of inventory to be ordered and conscripted, assembled and disassembled, set up and set aside. Everything approaches us merely as a source of energy or as something we must organize. We treat even human capabilities as though they were only means for technological procedures, as when a worker becomes nothing but an instrument for production. Leaders and planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human resources to be arranged, rearranged, and disposed of. Each and every thing that presents itself technologically thereby loses its distinctive independence and form. We push aside, obscure, or simply cannot see, other possibilities.</p>



<p>Common attempts to rectify this situation don’t solve the problem and instead are part of it. We tend to believe that technology is a means to our ends and a human activity under our control. But in truth we now conceive of means, ends, and ourselves as fungible and manipulable. Control and direction are technological control and direction. Our attempts to master technology still remain within its walls, reinforcing them. As Heidegger says in the third of his Bremen lectures, “all this opining concerning technology” — the common critique of technology that denounces its harmful effects, as well as the belief that technology is nothing but a blessing, and especially the view that technology is a neutral tool to be wielded either for good or evil — all of this only shows “how the dominance of the essence of technology orders into its plundering even and especially the human conceptions concerning technology.” This is because “with all these conceptions and valuations one is from the outset unwittingly in agreement that technology would be a means to an end.” This “instrumental” view of technology is correct, but it “does not show us technology’s essence.” It is correct because it sees something pertinent about technology, but it is essentially misleading and not true because it does not see how technology is a way that all entities, not merely machines and technical processes, now present themselves.</p>



<p>Of course, were there no way out of technological thinking, Heidegger’s own standpoint, however sophisticated, would also be trapped within it. He attempts to show a way out — a way to think about technology that is not itself beholden to technology. This leads us into a realm that will be familiar to those acquainted with Heidegger’s work on “being,” the central issue in <i>Being and Time</i> and one that is also prominent in some of the Bremen lectures. The basic phenomenon that belongs together with being is truth, or “revealing,” which is the phenomenon Heidegger brings forward in his discussion in “The Question Concerning Technology.” Things can show or reveal themselves to us in different ways, and it is attention to this that will help us recognize that technology is itself one of these ways, but only one. Other kinds of revealing, and attention to the realm of truth and being as such, will allow us to “experience the technological within its own bounds.”</p>



<p>Only then will “another whole realm for the essence of technology … open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth.” Placing ourselves back in this realm avoids the reduction of things and of ourselves to mere supplies and reserves. This step, however, does not guarantee that we will fully enter, live within, or experience this realm. Nor can we predict what technology’s fate or ours will be once we do experience it. We can at most say that older and more enduring ways of thought and experience might be reinvigorated and re-inspired. Heidegger believes his work to be preparatory, illuminating ways of being and of being human that are not merely technological.</p>



<p>One way by which Heidegger believes he can enter this realm is by attending to the original meaning of crucial words and the phenomena they reveal. Original language — words that precede explicit philosophical, technological, and scientific thought and sometimes survive in colloquial speech — often shows what is true more tellingly than modern speech does. (Some poets are for Heidegger better guides on the quest for truth than professional philosophers.) The two decisive languages, Heidegger thinks, are Greek and German; Greek because our philosophical heritage derives its terms from it (often in distorted form), and German, because its words can often be traced to an origin undistorted by philosophical reflection or by Latin interpretations of the Greek. (Some critics believe that Heidegger’s reliance on what they think are fanciful etymologies warps his understanding.)</p>



<p>Much more worrisome, however, is that Heidegger’s thought, while promising a comprehensive view of the essence of technology, by virtue of its inclusiveness threatens to blur distinctions that are central to human concerns. Moreover, his emphasis on technology’s broad and uncanny scope ignores or occludes the importance and possibility of ethical and political choice. This twofold problem is most evident in the best-known passage from the second Bremen lecture: “Agriculture is now a mechanized food industry, in essence the same as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and extermination camps, the same as the blockading and starving of countries, the same as the production of hydrogen bombs.” From what standpoint could mechanized agriculture and the Nazis’ extermination camps be “in essence the same”? If there is such a standpoint, should it not be ignored or at least modified because it overlooks or trivializes the most significant matters of choice, in this case the ability to detect and deal with grave injustice? Whatever the full and subtle meaning of “in essence the same” is, Heidegger fails to address the difference in ethical weight between the two phenomena he compares, or to show a path for just political choice. While Heidegger purports to attend to concrete, ordinary experience, he does not consider seriously justice and injustice as fundamental aspects of this experience. Instead, Heidegger claims that what is “horrifying” is not any of technology’s particular harmful effects but “what transposes … all that is out of its previous essence” — that is to say, what is dangerous is that technology displaces beings from what they originally were, hindering our ability to experience them truly.</p>

	<h5>
		What Is the Essence of Technology?	</h5>
</div></div>


<p>Let us now follow Heidegger’s understanding of technology more exactingly, relying on the Bremen lectures and “The Question Concerning Technology,” and beginning with four points of Heidegger’s critique (some of which we have already touched on).</p>



<p><i>First</i>, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, not the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves. The <i>second</i> point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history. <i>Third</i>, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern and industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows. And <i>fourth</i>, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces — that is to say, technologically.</p>



<p>Some concrete examples from Heidegger’s writings will help us develop these themes. When Heidegger says that technology reveals things to us as “standing reserve,” he means that everything is imposed upon or “challenged” to be an orderly resource for technical application, which in turn we take as a resource for further use, and so on interminably. For example, we challenge land to yield coal, treating the land as nothing but a coal reserve. The coal is then stored, “on call, ready to deliver the sun’s warmth that is stored in it,” which is then “challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running.” The factories are themselves challenged to produce tools “through which once again machines are set to work and maintained.”</p>



<p>The passive voice in this account indicates that these acts occur not primarily by our own doing; we belong to the activity. Technological conscriptions of things occur in a sense prior to our actual technical use of them, because things must be (and be seen as) already available resources in order for them to be used in this fashion. This availability makes planning for technical ends possible; it is the heart of what in the Sixties and Seventies was called the inescapable “system.” But these technical ends are never ends in themselves: “A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences.” This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but, instead, “only enters into its circuit,” and is “regulating and securing” natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.</p>



<p>Technology also replaces the familiar connection of parts to wholes; everything is just an exchangeable piece. For example, while a deer or a tree or a wine jug may “stand on its own” and have its own presence, an automobile does not: it is challenged “for a further conducting along, which itself sets in place the promotion of commerce.” Machines and other pieces of inventory are not parts of self-standing wholes, but arrive piece by piece. These pieces do share themselves with others in a sort of unity, but they are isolated, “shattered,” and confined to a “circuit of orderability.” The isolated pieces, moreover, are uniform and exchangeable. We can replace one piece of standing reserve with another. By contrast, “My hand … is not a piece of me. I myself am entirely in each gesture of the hand, every single time.”</p>



<p>Human beings too are now exchangeable pieces. A forester “is today positioned by the lumber industry. Whether he knows it or not, he is in his own way a piece of inventory in the cellulose stock” delivered to newspapers and magazines. These in turn, as Heidegger puts it in “The Question Concerning Technology,” “set public opinion to swallowing what is printed, so that a set configuration of opinion becomes available on demand.” Similarly, radio and its employees belong to the standing reserve of the public sphere; everything in the public sphere is ordered “for anyone and everyone without distinction.” Even the radio listener, whom we are nowadays accustomed to thinking of as a free consumer of mass media — after all, he “is entirely free to turn the device on and off” — is actually still confined in the technological system of producing public opinion. “Indeed, he is only free in the sense that each time he must free himself from the coercive insistence of the public sphere that nevertheless ineluctably persists.”</p>



<p>But the essence of technology does not just affect things and people. It “attacks everything that is: Nature and history, humans, and divinities.” When theologians on occasion cite the beauty of atomic physics or the subtleties of quantum mechanics as evidence for the existence of God, they have, Heidegger says, placed God “into the realm of the orderable.” God becomes technologized. (Heidegger’s word for the essence of technology is <i>Gestell</i>. While the translator of the Bremen lectures, Andrew Mitchell, renders it as “positionality,” William Lovitt, the translator of “The Question Concerning Technology” in 1977 chose the term “enframing.” It almost goes without saying that neither term can bring out all the nuances that Heidegger has in mind.)</p>



<p>The heart of the matter for Heidegger is thus not in any particular machine, process, or resource, but rather in the “challenging”: the way the essence of technology operates on our understanding of all matters and on the presence of those matters themselves — the all-pervasive way we confront (and are confronted by) the technological world. Everything encountered technologically is exploited for some technical use. It is important to note, as suggested earlier, that when Heidegger speaks of technology’s essence in terms of challenging or positionality, he speaks of modern technology, and excludes traditional arts and tools that we might in some sense consider technological. For instance, the people who cross the Rhine by walking over a simple bridge might also seem to be using the bridge to challenge the river, making it a piece in an endless chain of use. But Heidegger argues that the bridge in fact allows the river to be itself, to stand within its own flow and form. By contrast, a hydroelectric plant and its dams and structures transform the river into just one more element in an energy-producing sequence. Similarly, the traditional activities of peasants do not “challenge the farmland.” Rather, they protect the crops, leaving them “to the discretion of the growing forces,” whereas “agriculture is now a mechanized food industry.”</p>



<p>Modern machines are therefore not merely more developed, or self-propelled, versions of old tools such as water or spinning wheels. Technology’s essence “has already from the outset abolished all those places where the spinning wheel and water mill previously stood.” Heidegger is not concerned with the elusive question of precisely dating the origin of modern technology, a question that some think important in order to understand it. But he does claim that well before the rise of industrial mechanization in the eighteenth century, technology’s essence was already in place. “It first of all lit up the region within which the invention of something like power-producing machines could at all be sought out and attempted.” We cannot capture the essence of technology by describing the makeup of a machine, for “every construction of every machine already moves within the essential space of technology.”</p>



<p>Even if the essence of technology does not originate in the rise of mechanization, can we at least show how it follows from the way we apprehend nature? After all, Heidegger says, the essence of technology “begins its reign” when modern natural science is born in the early seventeenth century. But in fact we cannot show this because in Heidegger’s view the relationship between science and technology is the reverse of how we usually think it to be; natural forces and materials belong to technology, rather than the other way around. It was technological thinking that first understood nature in such a way that nature could be challenged to unlock its forces and energy. The challenge preceded the unlocking; the essence of technology is thus prior to natural science. “Modern technology is not applied natural science, far more is modern natural science the application of the essence of technology.” Nature is therefore “the fundamental piece of inventory of the technological standing reserve — and nothing else.”</p>



<p>Given this view of technology, it follows that any scientific account obscures the essential being of many things, including their nearness. So when Heidegger discusses technology and nearness, he assures us that he is not simply repeating the cliché that technology makes the world smaller. “What is decisive,” he writes, “is not that the distances are diminishing with the help of technology, but rather that nearness remains outstanding.” In order to experience nearness, we must encounter things in their truth. And no matter how much we believe that science will let us “encounter the actual in its actuality,” science only offers us representations of things. It “only ever encounters that which its manner of representation has previously admitted as a possible object for itself.”</p>



<p>An example from the second lecture illustrates what Heidegger means. Scientifically speaking, the distance between a house and the tree in front of it can be measured neutrally: it is thirty feet. But in our everyday lives, that distance is not as neutral, not as abstract. Instead, the distance is an aspect of our concern with the tree and the house: the experience of walking, of seeing the tree’s shape grow larger as I come closer, and of the growing separation from the home as I walk away from it. In the scientific account, “distance appears to be first achieved in an opposition” between viewer and object. By becoming indifferent to things as they concern us, by representing both the distance and the object as simple but useful mathematical entities or philosophical ideas, we lose our truest experience of nearness and distance.</p>


<div><div>
  
	<h5>
		Turning To and Away from Danger	</h5>
</div></div>


<p>It is becoming clear by now that in order to understand the essence of technology we must also understand things non-technologically; we must enter the realm where things can show themselves to us truthfully in a manner not limited to the technological. But technology is such a domineering force that it all but eliminates our ability to experience this realm. The possibility of understanding the interrelated, meaningful, practical involvements with our surroundings that Heidegger describes is almost obliterated. The danger is that technology’s domination fully darkens and makes us forget our understanding of ourselves as the beings who can stand within this realm.</p>



<p>The third Bremen lecture lays out just how severe the problem is. While we have already seen how the essence of technology prevents us from encountering the reality of the world, now Heidegger points out that technology has <i>become</i> the world (“world and positionality are the same”). Technology reigns, and we therefore forget being altogether and our own essential freedom — we no longer even realize the world we have lost. Ways of experiencing distance and time other than through the ever more precise neutral measuring with rulers and clocks become lost to us; they no longer seem to be types of knowing at all but are at most vague poetic representations. While many other critics of technology point to obvious dangers associated with it, Heidegger emphasizes a different kind of threat: the possibility that it may prevent us from experiencing “the call of a more primal truth.” The problem is not just that technology makes it harder for us to access that realm, but that it makes us altogether forget that the realm exists.</p>



<p>Yet, Heidegger argues, recognizing this danger allows us to glimpse and then respond to what is forgotten. The understanding of man’s essence as openness to this realm and of technology as only one way in which things can reveal themselves is the guide for keeping technology within its proper bounds. Early in the fourth and last Bremen lecture, Heidegger asks if the danger of technology means “that the human is powerless against technology and delivered over to it for better or worse.” No, he says. The question, however, is not how one should <i>act</i> with regard to technology — the question that seems to be “always closest and solely urgent” — but how we should <i>think</i>, for technology “can never be overcome,” we are never its master. Proper thinking and speaking, on the other hand, allow us to be ourselves and to reveal being. “Language is … never merely the expression of thinking, feeling, and willing. Language is the inceptual dimension within which the human essence is first capable of corresponding to being.” It is through language, by a way of thinking, that “we first learn to dwell in the realm” of being.</p>



<p>The thought that opens up the possibility of a “turn” away from technology and toward its essential realm is the realization of its danger. Heidegger quotes the German poet Friedrich Hölderlin: “But where the danger is, there grows also what saves.” By illuminating this danger, Heidegger’s path of thinking is a guide for turning away from it. The turn brings us to a place in which the truth of being becomes visible as if by a flash of lightning. This flash does not just illuminate the truth of being, it also illuminates us: we are “caught sight of in the insight.” As our own essence comes to light, if we disavow “human stubbornness” and cast ourselves “before this insight,” so too does the essence of technology come to light.</p>

	<h5>
		The Way of Nature and Poetry	</h5>
</div></div>


<p>A closer look at “The Question Concerning Technology” and some of the ways it adds to the Bremen lectures will help us further to clarify Heidegger’s view. In the Bremen lectures, Heidegger focuses on the contrast between entities seen as pieces in an endless technological chain on the one hand, and “things” that reveal being by bringing to light the rich interplay between gods and humans, earth and sky on the other. His example of such a “thing” in the first lecture is a wine jug used for sacrificial libation: The full jug gathers in itself the earth’s nutrients, rain, sunshine, human festivities, and the gift to the gods. All of these together help us understand what the wine jug is. In “The Question Concerning Technology,” it is products understood in a certain way that Heidegger contrasts with technology’s revealing. Drawing on Aristotle’s account of formal, final, material, and efficient causes, Heidegger argues that both nature (<i>physis</i>) and art (<i>poiesis</i>) are ways of “bringing-forth” — of unconcealing that which is concealed. What is natural is self-producing, self-arising, self-illuminating, not what can be calculated in order to become a formless resource. Poetry also brings things to presence. Heidegger explains that the Greek word <i>techne</i>, from which “technology” derives, at one time also meant the “bringing-forth of the true into the beautiful” and “the <i>poiesis </i>of the fine arts.”</p>



<p>In contrast to Heidegger’s notion of a thing or of revealing stands the kind of objectivity for which our natural sciences strive. But in spite of what Heidegger himself borrows from Greek thought, he emphasizes that there is a link between modern technology and classic philosophy because of Plato’s understanding of being as permanent presence. For Plato, the “idea” of a thing — what it is — is its enduring look, which “is not and never will be perceivable with physical eyes” and cannot be experienced with the other senses either. This attention to what is purely present in contemplation, Heidegger argues, ultimately leads us to forget the being of things, what is brought forth, and the world of human concern.</p>



<p>Heidegger’s brief sketches in these lectures suggest powerful alternatives to technological understanding that help us to recognize its limits. In “The Question Concerning Technology,” Heidegger’s hope is to “prepare a free relationship to [technology]. The relationship will be free if it opens our human existence to the essence of technology.” It is not the case “that technology is the fate of our age, where ‘fate’ means the inevitableness of an unalterable course.” Experiencing technology as a kind — but only one kind — of revealing, and seeing man’s essential place as one that is open to different kinds of revealing frees us from “the stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same, to rebel helplessly against it and curse it as the work of the devil.” Indeed, Heidegger says at the end of the lecture, our examining or questioning of the essence of technology and other kinds of revealing is “the piety of thought.” By this questioning we may be saved from technology’s rule.</p>





<p>Heidegger’s discussions offer several useful directions for dealing with technology, even if one disagrees with elements of his analysis. Consider his view of distance, where he differentiates neutral measured distance and geometrical shape from the spaces and distances with which we concern ourselves day by day. Someone thousands of miles away can be immediately present to one’s feelings and thoughts. Two tables may have identical size, yet each may be too big or small for comfortable, practical, or beautiful use. Heidegger’s understanding of the importance of space changes somewhat in his works, but what matters for us is his insistence that our understanding of the spaces in which we live is neither inferior nor reducible to a neutral, technical, scientific understanding of space. This is also true of time, direction, and similar matters. Perhaps most profoundly, Heidegger attempts to make visible an understanding of what is present, enduring, and essential that differs from a notion of the eternal based on time understood narrowly and neutrally. Heidegger’s alternatives provide ways to clarify the irreducibility of our experience to what we can capture technologically, or through natural science. One example of this irreducibility is Aristotle’s virtue, which acts in light of the right time, the right place, and the right amount, not in terms of measures that are abstracted from experience. Ordinary human ways of understanding are not mere folk opinion that is subservient to science, as some might say; they offer an account of how things are that can be true in its own way.</p>



<p>A second direction that Heidegger gives us for properly situating technology is his novel understanding of human being. For Heidegger, the traits that make us human are connected to our openness to being and to what can be revealed, to our standing in a clearing where things can approach us meaningfully. One feature of this understanding is that Heidegger pays attention to the place of moods as well as of reason in allowing things to be intelligible. Another feature is his concern for the unity in meaning in what is and is not, in presence and absence. For instance, an absent friend impresses on us the possibility of friendship as much as one who stands before us.</p>



<p>Central to Heidegger’s understanding of human being is the importance of death and dying in our understanding of our independence and wholeness. The importance of dying governs his choice of one of the examples he uses in the second Bremen lecture to clarify the difference between technology and ordinary concern:</p>



<blockquote><p>The carpenter produces a table, but also a coffin…. [He] does not complete a box for a corpse. The coffin is from the outset placed in a privileged spot of the farmhouse where the dead peasant still lingers. There, a coffin is still called a “death-tree.” The death of the deceased flourishes in it. This flourishing determines the house and farmstead, the ones who dwell there, their kin, and the neighborhood. Everything is otherwise in the motorized burial industry of the big city. Here no death-trees are produced.</p></blockquote>



<p>The significance of mortality fits together with Heidegger’s thought about reverence and gods. Gratitude, thankfulness, and restraint are proper responses to knowing ourselves as beings who are mortal. Heidegger does not have in mind dignity in a conventional moral or Christian sense. Rather, he has in view the inviolability of being human and of things as they can be revealed. Reestablishing the experience of reverence is central for limiting the control of technological thinking.</p>


<div><div>
  
	<h5>
		The Necessity of Making Distinctions	</h5>
</div></div>


<p>Heidegger’s arguments about technology also raise several difficulties. Most pressingly, he obscures the grounds for ranking what we may choose, and thus for choice itself. How exactly are the death camps different from, and more horrible than, mechanized agriculture, if they are “in essence” the same? How can we understand technology to be powerful but not so rigidly encompassing as to eclipse possibilities for ethical action?</p>



<p>Heidegger’s analysis of technology has something in common with what the early modern thinkers — from Machiavelli through Locke and beyond — who first established the link between modern science and practical life, considered to be radical in their endeavors: the importance of truth merely as effectiveness, of nature as conquerable, of energy and force as tools for control. In contrast to Heidegger, however, for these thinkers such views are tied to a larger argument about happiness and what is good. Now, these early modern views of science and practical life — and alternative views, such as those expressed in classical thought — seem to be the true grounds for understanding the dominance of technology, and also for our ability to limit this dominance. The question we must ask is what Heidegger adds to the discussion of these thinkers, if they account for the realm of openness, revealing, and significance that Heidegger appears to have discovered, while affording grounds for moral ranking and prudential judgment absent in Heidegger.</p>



<p>Indeed, one might ask (despite Heidegger’s objection to the question) whence technology arises in its essence. Is the way that beings present themselves to us meaningful only in Heidegger’s sense, or can an account be given for this meaning that at the same time allows and even demands moral choice and openness to being beyond what Heidegger allows? Because matters appear to us technologically in a way that seems tied to choices we make based on particular views of happiness, of the good, and of the sacred (all of which are at least to some extent subject to rational discussion), isn’t it true that everything technological can be judged, disputed, evaluated, and ranked? Is our understanding of happiness, of the good, and of the sacred truly subservient to a prior understanding of entities as technological, or is it instead interspersed and coeval with it, or even prior to it?</p>



<p>We see in Heidegger’s other works instances where he amalgamates radical differences, similar to if less grotesque than comparing death camps and mechanized agriculture, such as his claim that America and communist Russia are “metaphysically” the same, both equally dominated by technology and the “rootless organization of the average man.” This claim again indicates how Heidegger’s view of metaphysical identity can distort significant differences, and how to attend to and choose among them. Things that present themselves technologically in Heidegger’s sense seem so controlled by a pervasive unified horizon that the possibility of our grasping and ranking these differences — whether from within a technological understanding or from outside — remains obscure. In response, we might suggest that the distortion and the overreaching that make elements of technology questionable are in fact visible within technological activity itself because of the larger political and ordered world to which it belongs. This is not a causally reductive relation, but a descriptive and organizing one. To experience technology is also to experience its limits. We recognize the gulf between death camps and mechanized agriculture, and the difference in kind between Soviet tyranny and American freedom, despite seeming similarities with respect to the place of technology, because these belong to larger wholes about which we can judge. Perhaps the key to understanding technology and to guiding it is, despite Heidegger’s animadversions, precisely to wonder about the ordinary question of how to use technology well, not piece by piece to serve isolated desires, but as part of a whole way of life.</p>

      <title>Launch HN: HyperLinq (YC S21) – Desktop trading terminal</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28107989</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, my name is Amar, and I am the founder and CEO at HyperLinq (<a href="https://hyperlinq.io/" rel="nofollow">https://hyperlinq.io/</a>). We are building HyperTrader, a simple yet powerful native desktop trading terminal. Our app currently supports cryptocurrency trading, but we will soon expand into other asset classes like US stocks. We make it easy for traders to track multiple portfolios, discover the best prices, execute orders faster and analyze their trades.<p>Between my co-founders Karamvir and Kunal and myself, we have over 30 years of experience building trading systems. Karamvir and I worked at an inter-dealer broker in NYC and built many trading systems together. We also used to trade cryptocurrency. Back then there was a huge price disparity between exchanges, so we were able to do arbitrages.</p><p>We looked around and couldn&#39;t settle on a tool that could help us simplify the workflow, so we set out to build our own, not because we wanted to start a business but because we simply wanted to spend less time. In early 2018, we hacked out a small app that did no more than price aggregation and comparison. Price discovery was the main focus rather than managing portfolios or orders.</p><p>Soon we had many friends using the app. By mid-2018, we realized there was a business potential, but we found out that people did not want the new features we had been building. So we threw away our roadmap and started interviewing users. What they told us boiled down to two significant asks: (1) A blazingly fast app; (2) Efficient ways to execute orders. None of our users cared about multiple exchanges. They just wanted an app better than the exchange they were trading on. So we decided to build that.</p><p>As we always wanted to build a desktop app instead of a web app, we decided to go with Node.js, C++, React, Redux, and Electron. We are aware that Electron is not ideal in terms of CPU and memory usage and also the build sizes are huge. But to begin with, we wanted to use something that can work cross platform with a single source code. Eventually we have to move to better options for a true native experience - a goal for 3.0. For the most part, our team has done a decent job at managing CPU and memory so that our app is fast and reliable even when built with Electron. Majority of the processing happens directly on the users&#39; machines—only a small portion of data/processing happens on our servers. The app connects directly to the exchanges. Unlike many other aggregators, we chose not to pick an open-source project for connectivity. Instead, we wrote our own connectors in C++ and deployed them as Node.js add-ons. On the server-side, we chose to remain 100% serverless. We wrote our lambdas in either Python or Node.js.</p><p>Building a desktop app gave us many advantages in terms of performance. Also, the peer-to-peer connectivity with the exchanges made sure that we do not hit issues related to API rate limits or network delays. It also helped us keep our costs low.</p><p>We plan to introduce stocks and forex trading in 2022. We want to keep building it further and add as many asset classes as possible. Our goal is to create a terminal that caters to all kinds of traders.</p><p>If you’re interested, please try out the app and send us your feedback. What do you think of our product? How can we make it better? Happy to answer any comments or questions!</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Today is the World Wide Web&#39;s 30th birthday</title>
      <link>https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/08/30-years-on-from-introducing-the-web-to-the-world/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>On <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.archives/c/CfsHlSNYPUI/m/DTs60INnuzcJ">6 August 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted information about his WorldWideWeb</a> project to the public and introduced the Web to the world.</p>
<p><strong>“Try it“, Tim noted in his message – and since then, billions of people have.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Think about how often you use the Web. Aren’t you surprised at how essential the Web is to your life?</p>
<p><a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/6-in-10-people-around-the-world-now-use-the-internet">60% of the world is online</a>. We use the Web every day in our communications, jobs, connecting to family, sharing knowledge and even our democracy depends on it. But what do we take for granted about the Web? How utterly ubiquitous it is, for one thing.</p>
<p>In 2019 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/25/americans-going-online-almost-constantly/">Pew Research</a> noted that: <i>“Overall, 81% of Americans say they go online on a daily basis.”</i> <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17322/global-internet-access/">Statistica</a> found: <i>In Europe internet access stood at around 63 percent in 2009, within a decade that expanded to almost 80 percent. Less than 5 percent of the people living across Africa had access to the internet in 2009, while now almost a quarter of people across the continent have access to the internet.”</i> The number of online users has also grown rapidly in Asia. <a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-statistics">As of 2021</a>, about 2.6 billion people in Asia are online. As many as 40 million people in Southeast Asia came online for the first time in 2020, reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/southeast-asia-40-million-new-internet-users-in-2020-report-finds.html"><abbr title="Consumer News and Business Channel">CNBC</abbr></a> and that increased the total number of internet users to nearly 70% of the population in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This anniversary is particularly meaningful in China where, according to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/216110-at-fifteen-i-set-my-heart-upon-learning-at-thirty">poem by Confucius</a>, a 30th birthday means one’s feet are firmly planted upon the ground (<span lang="zh-hans">三十而立</span>). China has been on the internet on a permanent basis since the 1990s. Since 2000 when there were only 22.5 million internet users in China, that number has multiplied nearly 38 times in two decades. <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-02/03/content_5584518.htm"><abbr title="China Internet Network Information Center">CNNIC</abbr></a> reported that the number of Chinese online users has now reached nearly 1 billion. Web technologies have been playing an indispensable role in people’s daily life, and in the rapid development of China’s digital economy.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium has been producing technologies in some of the most vital areas of the growth of the Web, how we lived our lives during the global pandemic crisis; and how we will live in the future. To understand the magnitude of it, see <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-minute-internet-2020/">“What happens in an Internet Minute”</a> in 2020, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom hosts 208,333 meetings</li>
<li>There are 404,444 Netflix user streams</li>
<li>YouTube users upload 500 hours of video</li>
<li>Consumers spend $1,000,000 online</li>
<li>1,388,889 people make video/voice calls</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The Web’s richness, health, and future potential is linked to the immense amount of work done at the Web Consortium since its founding in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, to ensure it is open, interoperable and works for everyone. If many big companies are mentioned in press about the Web (and for some people, a few have even become synonymous with it), it is because their engineers unite at our table. Because of the work accomplished at the Web Consortium you can use the Web on any device; you can go to a Web page on any browser; you can read and write on the Web in almost any language; you experience the same Web on desktop, laptop, mobile, TV (not separate silos); you can use the Web whether you are blind or have mobility or accessibility issues; and your use of the Web is more and more secure. Please read our most recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/highlights/">state of the work</a> document.</p>
<p>The Web is one of the most powerful tools in history. Despite many users’ fears of social, political and technological misuse of the Web, the Web community are working at the Web Consortium to ensure that the Web can indeed be a force for good and connection, and we continue to translate the needs of humanity into Web technologies.</p>
<p>And our <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-Web-principles/">Technical Architecture Group states in their Ethical Web Principles</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The web should be a platform that helps people and provides a net positive social benefit… The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society. It has been, and should continue to be designed to enable communication and knowledge-sharing for everyone. In the 30 years since development of the web began, it has become clear that the web platform can often be used in ways that subvert that mission. Furthermore, web technologies can be used to cause harm, which is not in keeping with the spirit of this social mission. The web should be a platform that helps people and provides a net positive social benefit. As we continue to evolve the web platform, we must therefore consider the ethical implications of our work. The web must be for good.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebStandardsFuture/Vision">In their Vision for the Web, our Advisory Board has stated </a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our vision is for a World Wide Web that is more inclusive, and more respectful of its users: a Web that supports truth better than falsehood, people more than profits, humanity rather than hate.</p>
<p>We will improve the fundamental integrity of the Web platform. The Web will not only grow in scope and importance in our lives; it will grow in respect for its users, grow in the trust of its users, grow in its inclusion of all humanity as its users.</p>
<p>The Web is for all humanity.
The Web is designed for the good of its users. The Web must be safe for its users.
There is one interoperable world-wide Web.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we celebrate the release of the Web to the public, we celebrate the Web and all the Members of W3C who have helped to shape and evolve Web technologies to give us the accessible, international, secure, Web we use all today. Our Advisory Board, Technical Architecture Group, Members and community are committed to, 30 years on, making sure that the Web which Tim Berners-Lee gave to the world and which has changed history and changed our lives, will continue to be a benefit to humanity.</p>
<p>The Web Consortium: making the Web work, for everyone.</p>

That reconfiguration carries with it a rueful irony, because outreach was the fervently held mission of Romana Javitz, who was named curator of the collection in 1929 and for nearly four decades defined and defended it against those who thought that the hodgepodge of vernacular visual material didn’t belong in the library.</p><p>An immigrant from Minsk, Russia, Javitz shrewdly noted in 1940 that “many facts which require hours to be tracked down in texts can be swiftly and simply discovered by consultation with pictures.” The collection evolved as a collaboration between the investigations of the librarians and the demands of the public. With democratic evenhandedness, Javitz and her staff fielded queries from curious nobodies and established artists. (Although they made allowances for artists. When Warhol failed to return borrowed pictures, Javitz accepted that they were being employed to produce art and didn’t go after him.)</p><p>She responded to requests with the same courteous diligence, whether they came from an anonymous inquirer about “Peg-Leg John” (did he want the real-life abolitionist Peg Leg Joe or the fictional pirate Long John Silver?) or from Joseph Cornell, the master of assemblage. Cornell became a friend of Javitz, as did many photographers — Walker Evans, Paul Strand, Lewis Hine and Dorothea Lange among them — who were charmed by the respect she accorded their work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A holiday card made and sent by Andy Warhol to the founder of the New York Public Library’s Picture Collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Spread from a 1931 ledger of the Picture Collection, listing images that were added to the folders, from circus pictures to “Ladies of the White House.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>She was ahead of her time, but the world caught up. For the collection, that was a mixed blessing. Javitz had received gifts of hundreds of pictures from Evans, Lange and other photographers who sought wider circulation of their prints, which held relatively little commercial value. In a massive donation, <a href="https://thegreatdepressionphotos.wordpress.com/roy-stryker/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roy Stryker</a>, who headed the photography project of the Farm Security Administration during the Depression, transferred over 40,000 prints to the Picture Collection.</p></div><div><div><p>But after Javitz retired in 1968, photography’s status as an art form soared, with an elevation in prices. Thousands of exceptional artistic or historical photographs were moved from the circulating Picture Collection to the Print Room, where they joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dürer</a> woodcuts, Hiroshige prints and Goya etchings. “You’re not coming here to look for Dorothea Lange,” said Jessica Cline, the current head of the Picture Collection. “You’re here to look for farm life.”</p><p>From movie-set decorators to handbag designers, the Picture Collection has long served the creative community. “Someone was doing a movie that was set in New York at the turn of the last century,” said Jay Vissers, one of four full-time librarians at the Picture Collection, who has been there since 1994. “They looked at pictures to see how much horse poop was on the street.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Darin Mickey, a photographer and chair of the creative practices program of the International Center of Photography, browsing the “Accidents” folder of the Picture Collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Pictures from the “Friendship” folder.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Images from the “Transgenderism” folder on the Picture Collection tables.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>The veteran Hollywood production designer Wynn Thomas (“Do the Right Thing,” “Malcolm X”) always starts his research at the Picture Collection. Planning for Ron Howard’s 2005 boxing movie, “Cinderella Man,” set in North Bergen, N.J., he came up dry searching for visual records. “The librarian suggested that I look in the Depression-era folders and especially Chicago 1920-30,” he recalled. Not only did he find images of courtyards that influenced his design, but he also chose a palette of blacks, grays and pale colors, responding to the black-and-white photos from that era.</p><p>“When the production designers of ‘Mad Men’ needed to know what a shopping bag looked like in 1950, they came here,” said Joshua Chuang, the senior curator of photography at the library. “I think of this as the most radical access to secreted layers of visual culture.”</p></div></div><div><p>Art Spiegelman, who used the collection when he was working as a newspaper illustrator — “I’d browse for what a baseball uniform from the 1930s looked like,” he said — relied on it extensively when he was determining how to depict the characters in his graphic novel “Maus,” who are humans in animal form. He was especially concerned about the proportion of head to body. He went through folders of specific animals, children’s book characters, theatrical costumes (the ballet “Tales of Beatrix Potter” was instructive), and anthropomorphized animals in Chinese and Japanese art. He also found images for the concentration camps in which the protagonists, based on his parents, Vladek and Anja, were imprisoned.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">The New York Public Library’s Picture Collection, founded in 1915.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>But then he hit a roadblock looking for images related to the displaced persons camps that Vladek was in after liberation. “I was stumped and went to this librarian and he said, ‘That’s a hard one.’ Then he paused and said, ‘Try Quonset huts.’ And by God, there it was.”</p><p>These days, in a Google search for images on the internet, an algorithm spits out the most popular choices in a self-reinforcing stream of predictability. At the Picture Collection, the quirks of human choice dictate what you see. “It’s the high and the low side by side that’s so incredible,” Chuang said. “It has a kind of messy purity about it.”</p><p>The stacks behind Room 100 contain rows of recently acquired books and periodicals that will soon be clipped by librarians to supplement the folders. (About 400 pictures are added every month.) The taxonomy of the files itself is constantly changing. “Negroes” became “Black—Life,” and recent additions include “Transgenderism,” “Drones” and, more surprisingly, “Friendship.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Jay Vissers, a Picture Collection librarian since 1994. “Having people being able to borrow these things and constantly feeding these collections is very important,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gus Powell for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“Having people being able to borrow these things and constantly feeding these collections is very important,” Vissers said. “Otherwise, it’s like a box in the attic.”</p><p>Usage has declined in the age of the internet, but for its devotees, the tactile experience of touching paper images is even more powerful now that it is a novelty. “There is no substitute for that excitement of discovery around the physicality of something in a room that you hold in your hands,” said the photographer Peter Kayafas, who brings his Pratt Institute students to explore it.</p><p>The fate of the collection may have been sealed in 2017, when it was relocated to the main library from the Mid-Manhattan circulating branch. Going forward, Kelly wants users of the Picture Collection to be more prepared and less spontaneous. “The model that we’re trying to develop is that more information is transparently available online so they can find it before they come to the library,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Taryn Simon’s photo collage &#34;Folder: Explosions&#34; (2012) at Gagosian.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Taryn Simon and Gagosian</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Simon’s works hang on the wall of Room 100.

There is a rich history of Javitz and the Picture Collection, including correspondence and a list of all folder subject headings.</p><p>Inspired by the venerable portraits hanging in the library’s Beaux-Arts Edna Barnes Salomon Room, Simon framed her photo collages to be suspended by visible wires, with some on view in Room 100. In the long-planned second part of the exhibition this fall, in the Salomon Room, New York grandees of the era in which the library was founded will be facing some of Simon’s images from the Picture Collection — from left-wing demonstrations to naked rear ends — that they might have preferred to keep under wraps. “Their looking at each other is very important in the installation,” Simon said.</p><p>That face-to-face confrontation is a reminder that the collection — radically democratic in its wide-open accessibility and its agglomeration of the high and low — has discomfited sticklers for regulation and orderliness from the outset.</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Principles of Newspeak (1949)</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Principles of Newspeak</strong></p>
<p>Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in ‘The Times’ were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final, perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are concerned here.</p>
<p>The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought–that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc–should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single example. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as ‘This dog is free from lice’ or ‘This field is free from weeds’. It could not be used in its old sense of ‘politically free’ or ‘intellectually free’ since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.</p>
<p>Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.</p>
<p>THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life–for such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one’s clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE, FIELD–but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.</p>
<p>The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus for example, SPEEDFUL meant ‘rapid’ and SPEEDWISE meant ‘quickly’. Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT, were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.</p>
<p>In addition, any word–this again applied in principle to every word in the language–could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be strengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis, DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant ‘warm’, while PLUSCOLD and DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, ‘very cold’ and ‘superlatively cold’. It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-, etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no need for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally well–indeed, better–expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT, or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.</p>
<p>The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was STEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be. The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST), irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.</p>
<p>The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.</p>
<p>THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language.</p>
<p>The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.] They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, ‘orthodoxy’, or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, ‘to think in an orthodox manner’. This inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle, GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL; adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.</p>
<p>The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime), for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police) it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable. Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively, MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a ‘Times’ leading article as OLDTHINKERS UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspeak would be: ‘Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism.’ But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, fo instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped ‘false gods’. He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity). SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by GOODSEX–that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent.</p>
<p>No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or MINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation ‘good’ when applied to the Party and ‘bad’ when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but from their structure.</p>
<p>So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry of Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the Teleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such words as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it. The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way, the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more controllable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.</p>
<p>In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker’s mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words–GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC, BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others–were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.</p>
<p>So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word DUCKSPEAK, meaning ‘to quack like a duck’. Like various other words in the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when ‘The Times’ referred to one of the orators of the Party as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.</p>
<p>THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. There was, indeed, no word for ‘Science’, any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.</p>
<p>From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth–i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of ‘politically equal’, or that FREE had once meant ‘intellectually free’, than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced–its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.</p>
<p>When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there, imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one’s knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation–that is, alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known passage from the Declaration of Independence:</p>
<p>WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT…</p>
<p>It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK. A full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jefferson’s words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.</p>
<p>A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being transformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations were a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature–indispensable technical manuals, and the like–that had to be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of  Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.</p>

					<p>Payment services company Xsolla has reportedly fired 150 of its employees, with workers in the company’s office in Perm, Russia being terminated based on big data analysis of their activity (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/08/04/xsolla-fires-150-employees-using-big-data-and-ai-analysis-ceos-letter-causes-controversy">Game World Observer</a>).</p>
<p>Making the situation worse, Xsolla CEO and founder Aleksandr Agapitov sent an email to the affected employees explaining the decision, revealing that they had been let go because they had been tagged as “unengaged and unproductive employees.”</p>
<p>A translated version of the email reads as follows:</p>

<p>“You received this email because my big data team analyzed your activities in Jira, Confluence, Gmail, chats, documents, dashboards and tagged you as unengaged and unproductive employees. In other words, you were not always present at the workplace when you worked remotely.</p>
<p>“Many of you might be shocked, but I truly believe that Xsolla is not for you. Nadia and her care team partnered with seven leading HR agencies, as we will help you find a good place, where you will earn more and work even less. Sasha will help you get a recommendation, including the one from myself. And Natalia will read you your rights.</p>
<p>“Once again, thank you for your contribution. If you want to stay in contact with me, please write me a long letter about all your observations, injustice, and gratitude.”</p>
<p>This prompted immediate and predictable backlash: both for the layoffs themselves and for the tone of the email. According to <a href="https://properm.ru/news/business/198398/">ProPerm.ru</a>, the company is investigating to find the employee who leaked the email.</p>
<p>Following the layoffs, Agapitov held a press conference in which he explained that the mass layoffs were caused by the fact that the company has stopped showing 40% growth. Agapitov provided further details, including that the total number of laid-off employees could total 40% of the company’s headcount across all of its offices.</p>
<p>Following the press conference, Agapitov incited further controversy with a <a href="https://twitter.com/agapitovs/status/1422987608229961730">Tweet</a> that roughly translates to “Work your fucking ass off or get your fucking ass out.”</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/newsroom/biznes/436639-nichego-ne-izmenitsya-esli-ih-ne-budet-glava-permskogo-startapa-obyasnil">Forbes Russia</a>, Agapitov revealed that 60 of the affected employees might stay with the company following discussions with their managers, while those who have been let go will keep their medical insurance and receive medical pay equal to four to six monthly salaries.</p>

										<p>An international team of physicists has created what might seem like a contradiction in terms: a non-radiating source of electromagnetism. By placing antennas inside a hollow dielectric disc, the researchers exploited interference phenomena to create a non-radiative “meta-atom” that could have applications in several areas, including sensing and wireless power transfer.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s equations tell us that accelerating charges radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. This idea has led to the development of much modern technology, most notably radio communications in all its various guises. But it also posed a challenge to early 20<sup>th</sup> century physicists seeking to explain the stability of atoms, given that electrons were thought to follow (curved) orbits around atomic nuclei and therefore continuously lose electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p>The response to that problem was Niels Bohr’s atom and the development of quantum mechanics – in particular, the idea that electrons can only occupy certain discrete energy levels. Beyond the quantum world, however, some physicists wondered whether it might be possible to create classical “meta-atoms”: macroscopic objects containing alternating currents that confine the electromagnetic energy they generate and so prevent emission to the far-field.</p>
<h3>Electric moments without any poles</h3>
<p>This idea received a boost in 1957 when the theoretical physicist Yakov Zel’dovich predicted that the effects of parity violation on electric charges would yield electric moments without any poles. These so-called anapole states were discovered in the late 1990s when researchers at the JILA centre in the US made measurements of parity non-conservation in caesium atoms. Since then, other physicists have suggested that these anapole states could help explain how dark matter remains hidden electromagnetically.</p>
<p>In practical electrodynamic terms, anapoles can be generated by precisely tailoring charge distributions in time and space. These distributions are represented as a series of point-like electric and magnetic multipoles, the emissions from which interfere destructively in the far-field, leaving electromagnetic energy confined within a small space around the sources.</p>
<p>The simplest way to generate anapoles is to superimpose the fields from an electric dipole and a toroidal dipole – the latter can be imagined as electric currents flowing around the cross section of a torus. This has been demonstrated experimentally several times over the last few years, with various research groups exploiting nanofabrication techniques and metamaterials to observe anapole states at different frequencies – from microwaves to the visible range.</p>
<h3>Anapole observations</h3>
<p>In the new work, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esmaeel-zanganeh-b3574688/?originalSubdomain=ir">Esmaeel Zanganeh</a> and <a href="https://physics.itmo.ru/en/personality/polina_kapitanova">Polina Kapitanova</a> at ITMO University in Saint Petersburg, together with colleagues in Russia, Germany, Australia and China, have put together a relatively simple system to observe both electrical and magnetic anapole states – something not achieved before. The set-up consists of a radiating antenna placed inside a thick, hollow disc shaped like a roll of sticky tape. The disc is made from a dielectric with extremely high permittivity, which allows the disc to be smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it emits. The idea is that the electromagnetic waves from the antenna interfere destructively with secondary waves produced by electric current induced in the dielectric – thereby yielding a non-radiating source.</p>

Lett.</em> 2021)</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>The researchers first modelled their system numerically, assuming a 25mm-long copper electric dipole antenna emitting radio waves and placed along the thickness of a 20mm-diameter dielectric disc. Varying the frequency of the antenna, they compared the output of this source with that of the same antenna operating in free space. They found that at the disc’s resonant frequency (375 MHz), the system radiated slightly more power than the antenna alone, but that at a slightly higher frequency (411 MHz) the system’s radiated power dropped to seven orders of magnitude below that of the naked antenna.</p>
<p>Backing their modelling up with analytical calculations, the researchers showed that the sharp drop in power resulted from the antenna and disc generating equal and opposite radiation fields at 411 MHz, leaving just the confined electromagnetic field inside the source. They also did similar calculations involving a magnetic loop antenna – one that intercepts the magnetic field of electromagnetic waves – in place of the electric dipole device. Here, too, they found that by tuning the antenna away from its resonant frequency they could reduce the radiated (magnetic) power to near zero, and about three orders of magnitude lower than that of the antenna alone.</p>
<p>Finally, Zanganeh and colleagues tested their system experimentally, albeit at microwave rather than radio frequencies due to difficulties with materials and testing facilities. By placing a 6.4mm-diameter disc containing an 18mm long antenna in an anechoic chamber and using a horn antenna to pick up its far-field emissions, they measured a radiation pattern that closely matched their simulations.</p>

<p>The researchers believe that their new “meta-atoms” could have several practical applications. In particular, the very small radiative output of such devices, coupled with a larger concentration of electromagnetic energy in their immediate vicinity, could see them used for sensing, radiofrequency identification or near-field wireless power transfer, they say.</p>

      <title>‘Tortured phrases’ give away fabricated research papers</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02134-0</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_nature_com_articles_d41586-021-02134-0/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In April 2021, a series of strange phrases in journal articles piqued the interest of a group of computer scientists. The group, led by Guillaume Cabanac at the University of Toulouse in France, could not understand why researchers would use the terms ‘counterfeit consciousness’, ‘profound neural organization’ and ‘colossal information’ in place of the more widely recognized terms ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘deep neural network’ and ‘big data’.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that these strange terms — which they dub “tortured phrases” — are probably the result of automated translation or software that attempts to disguise plagiarism. And they seem to be rife in computer-science papers.</p><p>Research-integrity sleuths say that Cabanac and his colleagues have uncovered a new type of fabricated research paper, and that their work, posted in a preprint on arXiv on 12 July<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, might expose only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the literature affected.</p><p>To get a sense of how many papers are affected, the researchers ran a search for 30 tortured phrases in journal articles indexed in the citation database Dimensions. They found more than 860 publications that included at least one of the phrases, 500 of which were published in a single journal: <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i>.</p><p>“It harms science. You cannot trust these papers, so we need to find them and retract them,” says Cabanac.</p><p>Suspecting that the tortured phrases are the result of automated translation or software that rewrites existing text, Cabanac and colleagues ran a selection of abstracts from <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> and other journals through a tool that can identify whether texts have been generated by the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track-category="body text link">artificial-intelligence tool GPT</a>. Of the <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> papers flagged by the tool, manual checks revealed “critical flaws” in some of them, such as nonsensical text, as well as plagiarized text and images.</p><p>To dig deeper, the group downloaded all papers published in <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> between 2018 and 2021, a time frame they chose because an upgraded version of GPT was released in 2019. Analysis revealed that papers published after February 2021 had an acceptance time that was five times shorter, on average, than those published before that date. A high proportion of these papers came from authors in China. And a subset of papers had identical submission, revision and acceptance dates, the majority of which appeared in special issues of the journal. This is suspicious, the authors say. Unlike standard issues, overseen by the editor-in-chief, special issues are usually proposed and overseen by a guest editor, and focus on a specific area of research.</p><p><i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> was not the only affected title — the researchers also found evidence of tortured phrases in papers published in 35 other journals. “Preliminary probes show that several thousands of papers with tortured phrases are indexed in major databases,” they write, adding that “other tortured phrases related to the concepts of other scientific fields are yet to be exposed”.</p><h2>Special-issue investigation</h2><p>Around the time that Cabanac and his colleagues first noticed the tortured phrases, and unbeknown to them, the editor of <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> began having concerns about the integrity and rigour of peer review for papers that had been published in some of the journal’s special issues.</p><p>The journal’s publisher, Elsevier, launched an investigation. This is still under way, but in mid-July the publisher added expressions of concern to more than 400 papers that appeared across six special issues of the journal.</p><p>The expressions of concern say that the papers in the affected special issues of <i>Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> are being “independently re-assessed” one by one, and the journal will give further updates on their status once the investigations have concluded.</p><p>The publisher adds that a “configuration error in the editorial system” at the journal meant that neither the editor-in-chief nor the editor designated to handle the papers received them for approval as they should have. “This configuration error was a temporary issue due to system migration and was corrected as soon as it was discovered,” says the notice.</p><p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told <i>Nature</i> in a statement that the<i> Microprocessors and Microsystems</i> investigation has found that the authors probably used reverse-translation software to disguise plagiarism, and that this is the likely source of the tortured phrases.</p><p>The investigation has also revealed that 49 papers flagged as suspicious by Cabanac and his colleagues and published in standard issues of the journal were originally submitted to its special issues and were accepted by guest editors, “but were subsequently published in regular issues, at the authors’ request”, the statement says. These papers are already part of Elsevier’s investigation, it adds.</p><p>Elisabeth Bik, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track-category="body text link">a research-integrity analyst</a> in California known for her skill in spotting duplicated images in papers, says that the findings of Cabanac’s research are “shocking”. “This is a very new and disturbing type of fabricated paper,” she adds.</p><p>Jennifer Byrne, a molecular-oncology researcher at the University of Sydney, Australia, who also works on spotting fabricated papers, says that this is probably the tip of the iceberg because the researchers only looked in depth at one journal from one publisher. “These papers were also found because they were of very poor quality, but there could be more plausible AI-generated papers within the literature that are harder to detect,” she adds.</p>

      <title>Ode to a Streaming ByteString</title>

                <section>
                    <p>One of my favorite founding principles<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>The cynics among us might refer to it as a myth rather than a principle, given that Unix is no stranger to massive, kitchen-sink programs. Indeed, I’m writing this post in <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/emacs-config.html">such a program</a>.</span></span> of Unix is the universality of streams of bytes. Unix shells give us a <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html">monadic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipeline</a> operator <code>|</code>, that, given some computation <code>a | b</code>, executes <code>a</code> so that its output forms the input to <code>b</code>. This principle affords the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html">standard Unix commands</a> succinct composition, allowing the executing shell, rather than the programs themselves, to control the flow of data through a composed sequence of shell commands. Indeed, the principle of byte stream manipulation serves as the foundation for entire entire programming languages like <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. Tools like <code>xargs</code> and <code>tee</code> and <code>parallel</code> provide higher-order combinators to construct pipelines from further pipelines in ways beyond the capabilities of the pipeline operator itself.</p>
<p>Let’s consider some properties of programs that work well in pipelined computations such as these, using <code>grep</code> as the archetypal such program. <code>grep</code> is, of course, a tool of near-unparalleled importance, being enshrined in the POSIX standard, and it’s been optimized probably as <a href="https://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/old-age-and-treachery.html">thoroughly</a> as any other program. Our programs are probably not <code>grep</code>, but they may need to emulate how <code>grep</code> manages its input streams:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>It hides the details of resource manipulation.</em> The operating system, its system libraries, the shell in current use, and the implementation of its <code>|</code> operator hide the details of how input is batched and fed between files. Given that these details are abstracted from us, we should assume that input is buffered and chunked as necessary, and that these buffers and chunks are handled with as little overhead as possible. In particular, byte buffers read from an input stream should only be copied and retained if the program explicitly requests it: old input should never hang around in memory, given that the size of that input is theoretically unbounded.</li>
<li><em>It consumes its input lazily.</em> If I tell <code>grep</code> to search a ten-gigabyte file for one and only one occurrence of a string, it should consume only as much input as is required to fulfill my request. If more bytes are read from a stream than needed, it should be indistinguishable, performance-wise, from reading as little input as is possible, and should produce no change in observable program behavior.</li>
<li><em>It cleans up its resources.</em> Should <code>grep</code> request resources from the OS, or spawn some other helper process, these resources and subprocesses should be reclaimed quickly and reliably, even in the face of upstream or downstream pipeline failures, or even just a user impatiently hammering <code>Ctrl+C</code> and sending dozens of <code>SIGKILL</code> signals.</li>
</ol>
<p>C programs excel at fulfilling these criteria. Ha! Just kidding. C programs <em>can</em> excel at streaming data manipulation, because C programming entrusts <em>you</em> with its details, and you <em>might</em> be someone who excels at streaming data manipulation. Though the POSIX standard provides certain guarantees<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The POSIX standard <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/_Exit.html#tag_16_01_03_01">specifies</a> that certain resources—file descriptors, directory streams, stream converters from <code>iconv()</code>, and message catalogs from <code>catopen</code>—are relinquished upon program exit. Child processes spawned with the <code>exec</code> family of functions are usually not terminated (unless specifically requested by the parent process or an associated process group). Shared memory may or may not be relinquished, depending on whether other processes are referring to it. This digression is getting long enough as is; read the standard if you’re really curious.</span></span> about the manner in which resources are reclaimed upon program exit, you are still responsible for managing resources during program execution. There aren’t too many layers of abstraction between you, <code>stdin</code>, and <code>stdout</code>. Sure, if your underlying <code>FILE*</code> struct can do some caching for you, it probably does, but you can always read directly with <code>read(2)</code> or with some lower-level efficiency-focused framework like <code>kqueue</code>, <code>epoll</code>, <code>libdispatch</code>, or <code>io_uring</code>.</p>
<p>With higher-level, garbage-collected languages, things become a good bit trickier. It is the responsibility of a higher-level language to insulate us from the concerns of C: as with shell scripts, we should have, in the common case, no particular knowledge of how files are read, how memory is allocated, or how input is buffered. For most programs, especially the quick-and-dirty ones at which garbage-collected languages excel, such details won’t matter. But when you find yourself outside the realm of “most programs”, the situation can prove vexing: the nature of a high-level language to isolate you from decisions made about resource management becomes a problem when the correctness of your software depends on the details of said resource management. We find ourselves confronted with a particularly tricky dialectic: high-level languages aid in the development of programs by abstracting away details, but hinder said development when program correctness depends directly on properties of these abstracted details, such as when writing code that handles error conditions robustly or remains reliable in the presence of resource pressure.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>The difficulties encountered when addressing these concerns in portable shell scripts are just one of the many reasons we don’t write everything in shell.</span></span></p>
<p>Haskell’s declarative nature, non-strict evaluation, and correct-by-construction philosophy makes it, at least in theory, an attractive solution for writing code that works well in streaming pipelines. In practice, however, we run into three interrelated but distinct problems, ones that display a nice symmetry with the properties of well-managed input streams outlined above:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <em>streaming problem</em>: how do we write Haskell code that processes potentially-infinite data streams in a finite amount of memory?</li>
<li>the <em>lazy I/O problem</em>: given Haskell’s non-strict semantics, how do we consume input from the outside world lazily and efficiently?</li>
<li>the <em>resource manipulation problem</em>: given that we have no direct control over the lifetime of data, how do we ensure that our code manages and relinquishes expensive resources correctly?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m going to discuss how to address these problems, using the <code>streaming</code> ecosystem to address the first point, the <code>streaming-bytestring</code> library the second, and the <code>resourcet</code> library the third. Given Haskell’s more-than-one-way-to-do-it philosophy, there exist many alternative ecosystems—libraries like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit"><code>conduit</code></a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-bytestring"><code>pipes-bytestring</code></a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly"><code>streamly</code></a>, and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams"><code>io-streams</code></a> all provide tools to address these problems—but the <code>streaming</code> ecosystem is the one with which I am most familiar, and one with a generally friendly interface expressed with function composition. Both <code>streaming</code> and <code>streaming-bytestring</code> are cleverly designed and carefully thought through; I hope that this post serves as an exploration of their associated design decisions and resulting idioms. But to appreciate the depth of the problem, we have to start by discussing how Haskell represents byte buffers and streams of data, and how infelicities in their standard formulation provide <code>streaming-bytestring</code> its raison d’être.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to skip to the next section if you’re already familiar with Haskell string types and the perils of lazy I/O.</em></p>
<p>Haskell is notorious for its plethora of string types: <code>String</code> (a lazy list of four-byte <code>Char</code> values); strict and lazy <code>Text</code> values, and strict, lazy, and short <code>ByteString</code> values<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>The <code>bytestring</code> package also provides <code>Data.ByteString.Char8</code> and <code>Data.ByteString.Char8.Lazy</code>, but these actually use the same type in-memory, and provide <code>APIs</code> dealing in <code>Char</code> and <code>String</code> values rather than <code>Word8</code> and <code>[Word8]</code>, the former of which can be more natural as long as you know that your input is Latin-1 compatible.</span></span>. For the purposes of this article, we’re not going to worry about <code>String</code> or <code>Text</code>, because both operate on values known to be valid Unicode data. Our streaming pipelines operate on bytes, not Unicode characters—if, say, we want to be able to operate on binary data in such a pipeline, attempting to represent that data as Unicode text is inherently wrong. As such, we’ll focus only on Haskell’s byte buffer type, <code>ByteString</code>. Strict <code>ByteStrings</code> are pretty easy to understand:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>module</span> <span>Data.ByteString</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>data</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-- strict</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>BS</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>      <span>{-# UNPACK #-}</span> <span>!</span>(<span>ForeignPtr</span> <span>Word8</span>) <span>-- payload</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>      <span>{-# UNPACK #-}</span> <span>!</span><span>Int</span> <span>-- length</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>ByteString</code> represents a byte buffer and its associated length; in this it is similar to Go’s <code>[]byte</code> or Rust’s <code>&amp;[u8]</code> (though it has one fewer datum to track, as the Rust and Go types offer mutable access to the associated byte buffer and thus must keep track of its total capacity). <code>ByteString</code> values can contain <code>NUL</code> bytes, or indeed any other <code>Word8</code> value. If a given <code>ByteString</code> represents human-readable text, it must be converted to <code>Text</code> values explicitly with <code>Data.Text.Encoding</code> (for UTF-8/16/32) or <code>String</code> values with the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/encoding-0.8.5/docs/Data-Encoding.html#t:Encoding"><code>encoding</code></a> library; conversion failures should be handled at those callsites, though the correct behavior is often to throw an exception. This representation also allows for quick serialization and deserialization to C <code>char*</code> values, by extracting that <code>ForeignPtr Word8</code> and treating it as the memory address that it is. Similarly, we can choose to create that <code>ForeignPtr Word8</code> by copying from another source (like another <code>ByteString</code> or from a socket), or without copying by using unsafe <code>ByteString</code> operations (which can break referential transparency, but are sometimes necessary in extremely low-level code).</p>
<p>A memory and length pair, supporting O(1) length and indexing and O(n) concatenation, is pretty straightforward. More interesting is this type, the lazy <code>ByteString</code>. For the sake of clarity of examples, we’ll use a different type name than does <code>bytestring</code>, which uses the <code>ByteString</code> name for both lazy and strict variants, disambiguating via the module name (<code>Data.ByteString</code> for strict, and <code>Data.ByteString.Lazy</code> for lazy).</p>

<p>Rather than being a strictly evaluated pair of buffer and length, this is a lazy list, similar to what we would have were we to represent it with <code>[ByteString]</code>: <code>Empty</code> is like <code>[]</code> and <code>Chunk</code> is like the <code>:</code> operator. The only operative difference is that the first strict <code>ByteString</code> parameter is evaluated strictly, which slightly reduces its overhead in memory. The second parameter, a lazy <code>ByteString</code> representing the rest of the string, is <em>not</em> strict, since the whole point of this enterprise is to let the Haskell runtime manage the laziness associated with our lazy list of byte buffers. This sounds like a great deal: GHC’s evaluator is a finely-tuned instrument, and it’s unlikely that we can improve thereupon.</p>
<p>This lets us imagine how <code>ByteStream.Lazy.readFile</code> would work: given some chunk size N, the runtime would read <code>N</code> bytes from a source, placing them in the <code>!ByteString</code> parameter. The second parameter would then be a thunk that, if evaluated, would read another byte buffer of maximum length <code>N</code>. If that second parameter is never evaluated—in other words, if our calling code operates only on the first <code>N</code> bytes, the <code>Lazy.ByteString</code> parameter will never be evaluated, and the overhead of reading further bytes is never incurred. This, indeed, is more-or-less how that function <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.11.1.0/docs/src/Data.ByteString.Lazy.html#hGetContentsN">is implemented</a>.</p>
<p>Yet lazy <code>ByteString</code> values <em>don’t</em> work reliably when reading files lazily from disk. It violates the principle of deterministic resource cleanup: once a <code>Chunk</code> is read, reading beyond its embedded <code>ByteString</code> requires evaluating its second parameter, which entails further system calls to perform further needed disk I/O to build another <code>Chunk</code> (or an <code>Empty</code> if we’re at the end of the file). Should those system calls reference a socket or file descriptor that has since been closed, we’ll encounter a runtime crash. Even though <code>openFile</code> takes place in the <code>IO</code> monad, the resulting <code>ByteString</code> has <code>IO</code> hidden nefariously within, even when passed to contexts where it should be pure. I’ve seen this referred to as “pseudo-pure”: it may look like a pure computation, but it can incur I/O happening somewhere else, which, even if it works, is not the Haskell way. I/O is too important to be left implicit!</p>
<p>This has all been an exceptionally long-winded way to explain why no basic string type fulfills all our criteria in the presence of lazy I/O:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> and <code>Text</code> operations fail in the face of binary or non-Unicode data;</li>
<li>A strict <code>ByteString</code> is read all-at-once into memory, which violates both our need for laziness and constant resource consumption;</li>
<li><code>Lazy.ByteString</code> violates the princple of deterministic resource cleanup, unless you use Haskell’s experimental support for linear types, which prevent lazy bytestrings from outliving their associated file handle (though linear types are a bleeding-edge feature that have yet to see widespread adoption).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this may not always matter. Your program may deal only in small files, in which case you don’t need lazy I/O at all: you can just read file contents in as a strict <code>ByteString</code> and you’ll be okay. Computers have a <em>lot</em> of memory nowadays. But Haskell is a lazy language, and it excels at problems that can be phrased lazily. Should our business logic be a matter of lazy stream processing, we need some sort of abstraction that can lazily stream byte buffers from a source of data with constant memory consumption, minimal copying, and safe, deterministic resource cleanup. The trifecta of <code>streaming</code>, <code>streaming-bytestring</code>, and <code>resourcet</code> take care of this: let’s take a look and see how it works.</p>

<h2 id="the-important-types">The Important Types</h2>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> type <code>Stream (Of a) m r</code> represents a stream capable of yielding zero or more <code>a</code> values, performing effects in <code>m</code>, and returning a final <code>r</code> result type. We can see these capabilities in the definition of <code>Stream</code> itself: such a computation can yield a computed <code>Step</code>, embed a monadic <code>Effect</code>, or simply <code>Return</code> a pure value.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>module</span> <span>Streaming</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>data</span> <span>Stream</span> f m r</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>Step</span> <span>!</span>(f (<span>Stream</span> f m r)) <span>-- yield an item, and the rest of a stream, defined by the functor f</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>Effect</span> (m (<span>Stream</span> f m r)) <span>-- perform some monadic effect resulting in a further stream</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>Return</span> r <span>-- do nothing and return a final value</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The most common functor used as the value of <code>f</code> is the <code>Of</code> functor, which is identical to the tuple type <code>(,)</code>, but strict in its left argument, again to avoid the overhead of a lazy value when we know that the value in question has already been evaluated.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>module</span> <span>Data.Functor.Of</span> <span>where</span></span>

<p>The usual way to run a <code>Stream</code> is to call <code>Streaming.toList</code>, which returns an <code>Of</code>-pair containing a list of yielded <code>a</code> values and a final <code>r</code>. Note that <code>Of</code> is partially applied within the <code>Stream</code>, with its parameter <code>a</code> being the type of elements a stream yields.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>toList ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Of</span> [a] r)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s nothing here specific to bytestrings or I/O, which means that <code>Stream</code> is suitable for building streaming abstractions in any monad, not just <code>IO</code>. In contrast, <code>ByteStream</code> is concerned with holding chunked <code>ByteString</code> values, not with <code>Stream</code>:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>module</span> <span>Streaming.ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>data</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>Empty</span> r</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>Chunk</span> <span>{-# UNPACK #-}</span> <span>!</span><span>ByteString</span> (<span>ByteStream</span> m r)</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>Go</span> (m (<span>ByteStream</span> m r))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll notice that <code>ByteStream</code> is similar to <code>Lazy.ByteString</code>, with a few differences. Firstly, it has access to two type variables <code>m</code> and <code>r</code>: <code>m</code> represents a monadic context, with which chunked reads can perform side effects, using the <code>Go</code> constructor. This <code>Go</code> constructor is also new; it makes it explicit that reading further <code>ByteString</code> chunks can cause side effects, unlike <code>Lazy.ByteString</code>, which hid the fact that file I/O may occur when reading long strings from disk. By using <code>MonadResource</code> to clean up file handles, we can indicate, with the type system, that reading <code>ByteString</code> values out of a <code>ByteString</code> entails disk I/O, and thread that <code>MonadResource</code> constraint anywhere that file handles or ephemeral data must be cleaned up. Lastly, the <code>Empty</code> constructor takes an <code>r</code> argument, representing the final value, if any, of a given <code>ByteStream</code> computation.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>ByteStream</code> and the lazy <code>ByteString</code> might not seem seismic, but it represents something very profound about Haskell: often, we gain expressive power by treating <em>computations as data</em>. The fact that <code>ByteStream</code> has a <code>Go</code> constructor, which allows embedding arbitrary <code>m</code>-actions as long as they return a further <code>ByteStream</code>, gives <code>ByteStream</code> the ability to represent any kind of computation. In the case of <code>ByteStream</code> values yielded from the system, that <code>m</code> can be <code>IO</code>, or a monad transformer implementing <code>MonadIO</code>, or an effect stack implementing <code>Lift IO</code>. But if we were dealing with a <code>ByteStream</code> defined ahead of time, that <code>m</code> can be <code>Identity</code>.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>An interesting consequence of this is the <code>Show</code> instance for <code>ByteStream</code>, which requires the <code>m</code> parameter to be <code>Identity</code> and the <code>r</code> return type to be <code>()</code>, because the <code>Show</code> typeclass does not have access to the monadic context required to print out, say, a <code>ByteStream</code> that needs <code>IO</code> to perform its effects. (To print such a <code>ByteStream</code>, you’d pass it to the <code>stdout</code> eliminator, of type <code>MonadIO m =&gt; ByteStream m r -&gt; m r</code>, which evaluates that stream for its effects and prints to the console any chunks encountered while doing so.)</span></span></p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>ByteStream</code> isn’t just a computation, it’s a monad transformer, parameterized in terms of some parent monad <code>m</code>. This means we can use it in unexpected ways, such as the base monad in our <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/serving-http-content-with-fused-effects.html">quick-and-dirty web server</a>: in that case, having a <code>ByteStream IO</code> monad at the center of our effect stack gave us the capability to send streams of bytes down a network connection, using the <code>sendM</code> function. We farmed out the handling of <code>Request</code> values to the <code>Reader</code> effect, and a <code>State</code> effect took care of handling <code>Response</code> values, but for an HTTP handler to do anything useful, it must have access to a sink of bytes. Using <code>Lift (ByteStream IO)</code> allowed us access to such capabilities, without divulging the way in which these bytes are ultimately transmitted to the user (all we know is that it happens in <code>IO</code>, as indeed all network activity must).</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-bytestream">Creating a <code>ByteStream</code></h2>
<p>Examining the ways to construct <code>ByteStream</code> values makes the relationship between <code>ByteString</code>, <code>Stream</code>, and <code>ByteStream</code> clearer:</p>

<p>More interesting is the fundamental file-reading method, <code>readFile</code>. It is interesting in that it is the first time we see <code>MonadResource</code>, a typeclass provided by the <code>resourcet</code> package.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>readFile</span><span> ::</span> <span>MonadResource</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>FilePath</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>MonadResource</code> typeclass represents monads that are capable of managing the lifetime of critical resources, even in the presence of Haskell’s support for asynchronous exceptions. In a multithreaded Haskell program, any thread can send an exception to any other thread at any time, thanks to the fearsome <code>Control.Exception.throwTo</code>. <code>MonadResource</code>, and its corresponding <code>ResourceT</code> monad transformer, allow us a degree of durability in the face of this fact. Though <code>readFile</code> entails accessing a file on disk, we can be confident that even the most unluckily-timed of exceptions will not result in the associated file handle being orphaned or left unclosed. Additionally, the fact that this <code>MonadResource m</code> constraint is propagated, via the <code>m</code> parameter, to the resulting <code>ByteStream</code> makes it explicit that accessing the entirety of the associated <code>ByteStream</code> requires access to an associated resource, the lifetime of which is managed by the invoking <code>MonadResource</code> computation.</p>
<h2 id="running-extracting-and-converting">Running, Extracting, and Converting</h2>
<p>Since <code>ByteString</code> is the lingua franca byte-buffer type, it follows that we need to be able to run a <code>ByteStream</code> and assemble its constituent chunks into a <code>ByteString</code>, whether lazy or strict. However, because <code>ByteStream</code> computations have a return value, we must take it into account as well. We do so by using the <code>Of</code> type, again taking advantage of <code>Of a b</code>’s slight efficiency compared to <code>(a, b)</code>.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>toLazy ::</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Of</span> <span>Lazy.ByteString</span> r)</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>toStrict ::</span> <span>ByteStrean</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Of</span> <span>Strict.ByteString</span> r)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That <code>toStrict</code> function looks awfully tempting, and indeed it is, given how ubiquitous strict <code>ByteString</code> is in practice. We must be careful, however, not to lose constant-memory streaming here; if we create some infinite stream, and then immediately blow our memory by reading it aggressively into a buffer, then we haven’t accomplished anything. A safer approach is converting it back into a <code>Stream</code>:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>unpack ::</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> <span>Word8</span>) m r</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>toChunks ::</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> <span>Strict.ByteString</span>) m r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>unpack</code> and <code>toChunks</code> return their result in a pure context, not a monadic one, since converting between stream types doesn’t entail actually running the streams.</p>
<p>The interface boundaries between bytestrings and streams aren’t the only kind of eliminators that <code>ByteStream</code> supports. Indeed, familiar functions like <code>head</code>, <code>last</code>, and <code>length</code> are eliminators, consuming their input and running it for as long is as needed to return a result:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>head</span><span> ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Of</span> (<span>Maybe</span> <span>Word8</span>) r)</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>last</span><span> ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Of</span> (<span>Maybe</span> <span>Word8</span>) r)</span>

<p>Most of these eliminators have variant forms, suffixed with an underscore, that discard the <code>ByteStream</code>’s return value, returning only the left-hand side of the <code>Of</code>-pair; given how often one deals with <code>ByteStream m ()</code>, these functions can save many a pattern-match. Note that the only difference between these functions and their equivalents over strict or lazy bytestrings is the <code>m</code> effects parameter: because getting the constitient chunks of a <code>ByteString m ()</code> may involve monadic effects in <code>m</code>, these functions must have a monadic return type.</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>head_ ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Maybe</span> <span>Word8</span>)</span>

<h2 id="transformations">Transformations</h2>
<p>As with the above eliminators, there also exist familiar combinators for building new <code>ByteStream</code> values out of existing ones:</p>

<p>Again, it helps to start thinking in computations rather than in data. <code>take n</code> takes in a <code>ByteString</code> computation and returns the result of limiting that computation’s underlying byte stream to <code>n</code> characters. <code>map</code> promotes a function on bytes (<code>Word8 -&gt; Word8</code>) to a function operating over <code>ByteStream</code> computations. In promoting <code>ByteString</code> values to <code>ByteStream</code> computations, we’ve lost none of the vocabulary from <code>ByteString</code> with which we’re familiar, but that vocabulary becomes in turn more lyrical and powerful. Note that unlike the eliminators, these functions do not run in <code>m</code>: they merely describe modifiers to existing <code>ByteStream</code> computations, deferring the actual execution of the stream to an eliminator.</p>

<p>I enjoy the interplay between the types provided by <code>streaming</code> and <code>streaming-bytestring</code>, and in an effort to share why this is so, I’ve expressed the classic Knuth-McIlroy word-frequency classifier: given some input file, we are to process it word-by-word, keeping track of how many times a given word is encountered, and print the twenty-five most commonly-occurring words. This isn’t a <em>perfect</em> problem to express with streaming combinators, since to classify the occurrences of words we must retain them in memory (and thereby break streaming), but it’s a classic problem and the resulting code is quite handsome. Let’s build it, like so. First, we’ll need some imports.</p>

<p>Given a <code>FilePath</code> as input, we need to return an association list, mapping words to their frequency.</p>
<div id="cb15" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>classify ::</span> <span>MonadResource</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>FilePath</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m [(<span>Strict.ByteString</span>, <span>Int</span>)]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In classical Haskell fashion, we’ll express this with function composition. As is my preference when explicating compositions, I’m going to use the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operator, provided by <code>Control.Category</code>, to express said composition in a left-to-right fashion. Furthermore, I’m going to place, in the comments, the type of the computation at the given point. If omitted, it is the same as the previous stage. (We could do this in code with <code>id</code> and the <code>TypeApplications</code> extension, which has the advantage of checking our assumptions at each stage, but it gets a little noisy.)</p>
<p>We start off by calling <code>ByteStream.readFile</code>, yielding a stream with resource-based access, but no associated return type. We then normalize the input by converting everything to lowercase and ignoring.</p>
<div id="cb16" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs" data-padline="no"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>classify                          <span>-- FilePath</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>=</span> ByteStream.readFile           <span>-- ByteStream m ()</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.map Word8.toLower</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, we want to split this <code>ByteStream</code> up into individual words, so that we can eventually shove these words piece-by-piece into the actual classification stage. <code>ByteStream.splitWith</code> takes care of this for us, yielding a stream where the functorial type is itself <code>ByteStream m</code> (rather than the <code>Of</code> functor that we usually use). That <code>m</code> appears twice in the resulting type, since it’s propagated both to the <code>Stream</code> and the <code>ByteStream</code> yielded from each per-element chunk of the stream.</p>
<div id="cb17" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs" data-padline="no"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.splitWith Word8.isSpace <span>-- Stream (ByteStream m) m ()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Subsequently, we want to ensure that there aren’t any stray empty strings. The <code>denull</code> function operates on <code>Streams</code> of <code>ByteStreams</code>, removing any empty chunks that appear.</p>

<p>We now have a <code>Stream</code> containing <code>ByteStream</code> values, each of which we know to be all lowercase characters. We now need to build something capable of representing a histogram of their frequency of occurrence. At first glance, such a data type could be <code>Map (ByteStream m ()) Int</code>, but we run into a problem: <code>ByteStream</code> quantities have no <code>Ord</code> instance, being computations rather than bare values. Nor do we have a <code>Hashable</code> instance, so we cannot evade this with <code>HashMap</code>. What we must do instead is take a step that converts our functorial shape from <code>ByteStream m</code> to <code>Of Strict.ByteString</code>, element-by-element. <code>Streaming.mapped</code> is a combinator capable of changing the functorial shape in such a way, and to it we pass a familiar function: <code>toStrict</code>, the function that turns a <code>ByteStream</code> into a <code>Strict.ByteString</code>. (Though calling this function on a massive <code>ByteStream</code> could break streaming, we know the individual words are going to be fairly short, so we needn’t worry.) Subsequently, we can filter the stream to remove punctuation and other such non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
<div id="cb19" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Streaming.mapped ByteStream.toStrict <span>-- Stream (Of Strict.ByteString) m ()</span></span>

<p>Now we must build a <code>HashMap</code>-based histogram. Though we could pull in the <code>foldl-statistics</code> package rather than do this ourselves, it’s not painful to express with the <code>streaming</code> library’s <code>fold_</code> function, which takes a step function, a starting value, and an extraction function. Our starting value will be the empty <code>HashMap</code>, our extraction function will be its <code>toList</code> destructor yielding <code>(ByteString, Int)</code> pairs, and our step function will either insert <code>1</code> or add <code>1</code> to the value already contained therein.</p>
<div id="cb20" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>let</span> step m str <span>=</span> Map.insertWith (<span>+</span>) str <span>1</span> m</span>

<p>And now we can use the list primitives<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>A fun exercise for the interested reader is to use a less naïve method to extract the most common occurrences, avoiding the overhead of <code>Map.toList</code>.</span></span> <code>sortOn</code> and <code>take</code> to extract the twenty-five most common occurrences. (The <code>snd &gt;&gt;&gt; Down</code> invocation ensures that we compare each <code>(ByteString, Int)</code> pair based on its second field, in descending order.)</p>
<div id="cb21" data-tangle="../tangles/Streaming.hs"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fmap</span> (List.sortOn (<span>snd</span> <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Down</span>) <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> List.take <span>25</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Put all together, we have a pipeline that is aesthetically appealing, and around half as fast as do the optimized-over-decades tools that make up McIlroy’s pipeline (which is what we expect, given that Haskell programs run around half as fast as does handwritten C).</p>

<p>Here’s another example, extracted from some code I once worked on to interact with Git repositories. This code, given some <code>Blob</code> type carrying with it a pointer to some Git data on disk, summarizes its contents, retaining both the first line of the blob for display as well as the number of bytes found in the blob in total.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Result</span> (<span>Of</span> (<span>Maybe</span> <span>Lazy.ByteString</span>) <span>Int</span>)</span>
<span id="cb23-2"><a href="#cb23-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb23-3"><a href="#cb23-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>summarize ::</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4"><a href="#cb23-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  (<span>MonadMask</span> m, <span>MonadUnliftIO</span> m, <span>Git.MonadGit</span> r m, <span>Git.Libgit2.HasLgRepo</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb23-5"><a href="#cb23-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>Git.Blob</span> r m <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb23-6"><a href="#cb23-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>  m <span>Result</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first few lines are uninteresting, as they are concerned solely with coercing the <code>Lazy.ByteString</code> contents of this <code>Git.Blob</code> into a <code>ByteStream</code>. The only new function here is <code>mwrap</code>, an alias for the <code>Go</code> constructor, which promotes an effect returning a <code>ByteStream</code> into a <code>ByteStream</code> itself.</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>summarize <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2"><a href="#cb24-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  Git.blobToLazyByteString     <span>-- m Lazy.ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><a href="#cb24-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fmap</span> ByteStream.fromLazy <span>-- m (ByteStream m ())</span></span>
<span id="cb24-4"><a href="#cb24-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.mwrap         <span>-- ByteStream m ()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we must think a bit harder. The <code>ByteStream</code> contents of this blob have two purposes: we must count the number of lines therein, and we must retain their first line for display purposes. As such, we have two eliminating functions we want to use <code>ByteStream.head_</code> and <code>ByteStream.length</code>. Because <code>ByteStream</code> hews closely to a consumer-producer model, it won’t suffice simply to invoke these functions: we must copy the <code>ByteStream</code> input.</p>
<p>The copy operation on strict <code>ByteString</code> values has a pretty straightforward type signature:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>copy ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not rocket science: it takes in a byte buffer, copies it with <code>memcpy</code> or some equivalent formulation, and returns the copy. In contrast, the type signature of <code>streaming-bytestring</code>’s copy operation is subtzle:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>copy ::</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> (<span>ByteStream</span> m) a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Copying a <code>ByteStream</code> is <em>not</em> a process of <code>memcpy</code>. Indeed, we specifically don’t want to copy the byte buffers within the stream, because that can be expensive, and we’re not operating destructively upon them, since Haskell is a pure language. Instead, our <code>copy</code> will copy the <em>constructors</em>, rather than the <em>contents</em>, of <code>ByteStream</code>, wrapping them around the <code>m</code> parameter in <code>ByteStream m</code> and ultimately yielding a nested <code>ByteStream (ByteStream m)</code>. This nested datum represents our responsibility to handle those effects, whatever we do to them. In handling those effects, we will eliminate that nested <code>ByteStream</code> layer, returning it to an <code>m</code>, and ultimately acting on a stream of data in two ways without breaking streaming or incurring otiose buffer copies.</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.copy <span>-- ByteStream (ByteStream m) ()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two eliminators to call. Let’s start by specializing the type of <code>length_</code> so that it behaves as though we had passed in a <code>ByteStream (ByteStream m)</code>, using the <code>TypeApplications</code> extension to GHC:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>length_ <span>@</span>(<span>ByteStream</span> m)</span>
<span id="cb28-2"><a href="#cb28-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>  ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> (<span>ByteStream</span> m) r <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Computing the <code>length</code> of a nested <code>ByteStream</code> returning an <code>r</code> value returns another <code>ByteStream</code>, but paired up with more information. The resulting <code>ByteStream</code> now keeps track of the length of all the data that runs through it; when it finishes and returns an <code>r</code> value, that value is now associated with an <code>Int</code> representing that length. The fact that computing the <code>length</code> of that nested <code>ByteStream</code> entailed its elimination is made apparent by the fact that the resulting <code>ByteStream</code> is flat, its monadic parameter just <code>m</code>.</p>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.length_ <span>-- ByteStream m Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we’re set to compute the length of the input stream as a whole, we need to extract its first line. As with our previous examples, we’ll call <code>lines</code> to turn the input <code>ByteStream</code> into a <code>Stream</code>, then <code>Streaming.mapped</code> to yield a stream of <code>Lazy.ByteString</code> values (since the whole file contents could, concievably, be on one line, we must exercise caution). We’ll then call <code>head</code> to get the first line of the blob and its total length.</p>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ByteStream.lines <span>-- Stream (ByteStream m) m Int</span></span>
<span id="cb30-2"><a href="#cb30-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Streaming.mapped ByteStream.toLazy <span>-- Stream (Of Lazy.ByteString) m Int</span></span>
<span id="cb30-3"><a href="#cb30-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Streaming.head <span>-- m (Of (Maybe Lazy.ByteString), Int)</span></span>
<span id="cb30-4"><a href="#cb30-4" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>Result</span> <span>-- m Result</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>All together, this pipeline is remarkably concise, and it retains glorious type safety. We can be confident that, should we be provided some massive Git blob, our program will not chew through more memory than it should.</p>

<p>You may notice that these examples don’t deal exclusively with the tools provided by <code>streaming-bytestring</code>: idiomatic use of <code>streaming-bytestring</code> is inextricably connected with <code>streaming</code> itself. I pointed out earlier that <code>ByteStream</code> is like a version of <code>Lazy.ByteString</code> extended to encapsulate effectful computations, and that doing so gives us <code>ByteStream</code> instances for <code>Functor</code>, <code>Monad</code>, and <code>MonadTrans</code>. But the similarities don’t end there: because <code>streaming</code> depends on the <code>mmorph</code> package, these types also implement the <code>MFunctor</code> and <code>MMonad</code> classes, which represent functors and monads in the category of monads. (If your attention just wandered, I know, I <em>know</em>, but stay with me. I promise that this is pretty cool.)</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking a look at the <code>copy</code> operations for <code>Stream</code> and <code>ByteStream</code>.</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>Streaming.copy<span> ::</span> <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) m r <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) (<span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) m) r</span>
<span id="cb32-2"><a href="#cb32-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>ByteStream.copy<span> ::</span> <span>ByteStream</span> m r <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteStream</span> (<span>ByteStream</span> m) r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These functions both take in an action based in some monad <code>m</code> and return a new action in which that <code>m</code> is wrapped in a further type, <code>Stream (Of a) m</code> for the former and <code>ByteStream m</code> for the latter. For both of these, we can think of copying as a <em>nesting</em> operation. And as it happens, <code>MFunctor</code> and <code>MMonad</code> provide us vocabulary to handle monads within monads. We’ll cover <code>MFunctor</code> here, as it’s pretty simple.</p>
<div id="cb33"><pre><code><span id="cb33-1"><a href="#cb33-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>class</span> <span>MFunctor</span> t <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb33-2"><a href="#cb33-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>  hoist ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> old a <span>-&gt;</span> new a) <span>-&gt;</span> t old b <span>-&gt;</span> t new b</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>hoist</code> promotes a natural transformation from <code>old</code> to <code>new</code> to a function operating on <code>MFunctor</code> values, one that changes the type of the nested monad parameter <code>m</code>. We can see this in action if we speak in terms of <code>Stream</code> and <code>ByteStream</code>:</p>
<div id="cb34"><pre><code><span id="cb34-1"><a href="#cb34-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>hoist <span>@</span>(<span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a)) <span>::</span></span>
<span id="cb34-2"><a href="#cb34-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb34-3"><a href="#cb34-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> old a <span>-&gt;</span> new a) <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb34-4"><a href="#cb34-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) old r <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb34-5"><a href="#cb34-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>Stream</span> (<span>Of</span> a) new r</span>
<span id="cb34-6"><a href="#cb34-6" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb34-7"><a href="#cb34-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>hoist <span>@</span><span>ByteStream</span> <span>::</span></span>
<span id="cb34-8"><a href="#cb34-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb34-9"><a href="#cb34-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>  (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> old a <span>-&gt;</span> new a) <span>-&gt;</span></span>

<p>Thanks to <code>hoist</code>, we have a consistent vocabulary for speaking about nested <code>Stream</code> and <code>ByteStream</code> values, no matter how deeply nested they may be. It also gives us certain invariants for how we can expect our library to behave: for example, hoisting the <code>effects</code> eliminator into a nested <code>ByteStream</code> peels away the nesting, discarding all chunks and merely running the effects. From this we can deduce that <code>copy &gt;&gt;&gt; hoist effects</code> is equivalent to <code>id</code>, as is just plain <code>copy &gt;&gt;&gt; effects</code> itself. Whether we want to flatten a nested monad externally or internally with <code>hoist</code>, we have options: use whichever is more aesthetically pleasing at the time.</p>

      <title>Glenfiddich uses its own whisky waste to fuel its trucks</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                            Scotch whisky maker Glenfiddich has announced that it will convert its delivery trucks to run on low-emission biogas made from waste products from its own whisky distilling process.
                        </p><div>
                        <p>The company said it has installed fuelling stations at its Dufftown distillery in north-eastern Scotland which use technology developed by its parent company William Grant and Sons. It will convert its production waste and residues into an Ultra-Low Carbon Fuel (ULCF) gas that produces minimal carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions.</p>
<p>Glenfiddich said the transition to using fuel made from the distillery’s waste product is part of a “closed-loop” sustainability initiative. Stuart Watts, distillery director at William Grant, said traditionally Glenfiddich has sold off spent grains left over from the malting process to be used for a high-protein cattle feed.</p>
<p>However, through <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/05/the-unexpected-ways-in-which-factories-are-saving-energy/" target="_blank">anaerobic digestion</a> – where bacteria break down organic matter, producing biogas – the distillery can also use the liquid waste from the process to make fuel and eventually recycle all of its waste products this way.</p>
<p>“The thought process behind this was ‘What can we do that’s better for us all?’,” Watts said.</p>

<p>The distiller, which sells over 14 million bottles of single-malt whisky a year, said its whisky waste-based biogas is already powering three specially converted trucks that transport Glenfiddich spirit from production at Dufftown through to bottling and packaging, covering four William Grant sites in central and western Scotland.</p>
<p>Sixteenth-century English chronicler Raphael Holinshed wrote that, when consumed moderately, whisky’s many medicinal benefits include preventing the “head from whirling, the tongue from lisping... the hands from shivering, the bones from aching.”</p>
<p>Experts now add that its waste products could also benefit the environment. The biogas emitted by whisky&#39;s production process cuts CO2 emissions by over 95 per cent compared to diesel and other fossil fuels and reduces other harmful particulates and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 99 per cent, Glenfiddich said.</p>
<p>The trucks Glenfiddich is using are converted vehicles from truck maker Iveco that normally run on liquefied natural gas. Each biogas truck will displace up to 250 tonnes of CO2 annually, according to the distiller.</p>
<p>Glenfiddich has a fleet of around 20 trucks and Watts believes the technology could be applied throughout the delivery fleets of William Grant and Sons’ whisky brands. It could also be scaled up to fuel other company’s trucks.</p>
<p>The Scottish whisky industry hopes to hit carbon net-zero targets by 2040.</p>

      <title>Clock Synchronization (2020)</title>
      <link>https://signalsandthreads.com/clock-synchronization/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___signalsandthreads_com_clock-synchronization_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="000004">00:00:04</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p>

<h2 id="000115">00:01:15</h2>

<p>So, I guess the rough gist is something like you have some oscillator, a little crystal effectively that’s inside the computer that is oscillating at some frequency, and that’s driving an interrupt that the operating system is going to handle in some level – there’s probably lots of details here that I’m just skipping over – but that’s driving an interrupt that’s going happen in the operating system. And the operating system is using that to derive its notion of time, and so if you have a really high-quality oscillator, and those timer interrupts happen at the right rate so that you’re tracking real-time that might just happen, and if your oscillator’s very good, and very stable you could actually just be pretty close to the correct time just by virtue of that. But the truth is that most computers come with fairly bad oscillators and they change their frequencies for various reasons like heat, so if you are using your computer to compile the Linux kernel or something like that, that could change the heat profile, change the frequency of the oscillator, and actually change how well you’re doing of keeping real time.</p>

<h2 id="000205">00:02:05</h2>

<p>When we naively think of clock synchronization as people, we think of it as like, “I’m going to go set my clock”. I’m going to look at what time it is and adjust my clock to match whatever real-time is, but you’re actually talking about a different thing here. You’re talking not just about setting what the right time is right now but keeping that time correct, essentially keeping the rate at which time is going forward in sync.</p>

<h2 id="000224">00:02:24</h2>

<p>Correct. You’d love it if you could get like a really, really high-quality oscillator for super cheap in all your computers and then you wouldn’t need a lot of adjustment to get them to keep the correct time, but that would be really expensive. You can buy such things, they just cost a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="000237">00:02:37</h2>

<p>So, you say that heat and various other things that are going on in the computer will cause this rate at which time is appearing to march forward inside of your computer to drift around. How accurate are these? Can give me a kind of numerical sense of how far these things drift away?</p>

<h2 id="000253">00:02:53</h2>

<p>The stuff that we run, we capture some of these statistics, we see machines that have a frequency correction applied to them of, say, 50 parts per million, which is like microseconds per second, so that works out to roughly a couple seconds per day, is how you would wind up drifting off. But I’m sure that if you had a super old desktop under your desk, that you stole from your parents or something and you were trying to rebuild into a Linux box, you might have worse numbers than that. Like a sort of relatively current generation server from a well-known vendor, you’re talking somewhere around 50 to 100 microseconds per second that they can sort of walk-off out of alignment.</p>

<h2 id="000327">00:03:27</h2>

<p>Okay, so clock synchronization is the process of trying to get all of those clocks that you have across your whole data center and across multiple data centers to be in sync with each other. Is that the right way of thinking about it?</p>

<h2 id="000339">00:03:39</h2>

<p>I think so. “In sync”, is an interesting sort of thing to say, right? You kind of would like that if you were able to instantaneously ask two random servers on your network, what time it was at the same exact point in time, if you could somehow magically do that, that they would agree to some relatively small margin of error, and I think that that’s kind of what we mean by clock synchronization. That if you could somehow magically freeze time and go ask every single computer on your network, “Hey. What time do you think it is?” that they would all roughly agree to within some error bound that you can define.</p>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>Right. And this basic model actually assumes that there is a well-defined notion of what it means to be instantaneously at the same time, which isn’t exactly true because of relativity and stuff like that, but we’re going to mostly ignore that. So, I guess one property that you’re highlighting here is having the clocks agree with each other, and that’s part of it, but there’s another piece, right, which is having the clocks agree with some external reference. There’s some notion of like, what does the world think the time is? So, where does that external reference come from?</p>

<h2 id="000435">00:04:35</h2>

<p>I’m not an expert on this stuff, but I’ll give you the sort of 10,000-foot view. You have various physics laboratories all over the world, like NPL in the UK, and other places across the world. They all have measurements of what they think time is, using things like hydrogen masers and sort of very accurate atomic methods. They contribute all of that stuff to a single source who kind of averages it, or does some sort of weighting, to come up with what the correct time is, and then you kind of magic that over to the Air Force, who then sends it up to the GPS constellation. And GPS has a mechanism for getting time from the GPS satellites down to GPS receivers, and so if you’re a person who runs a computer network and you’re interested in synchronizing your clocks to a relatively high degree of accuracy with something like UTC, which is effectively Greenwich Mean Time, it is just sort of the current time without time zones applied. </p>

<h2 id="000557">00:05:57</h2>

<p>And for the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to treat those GPS receivers as the received wisdom as to what time it is, and our job is to figure out how, inside of a computer network, you make all of the different devices agree with each other and agree with that external reference.</p>

<h2 id="000611">00:06:11</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="000612">00:06:12</h2>

<p>Why is it important? What does having synchronized clocks help you do?</p>

<h2 id="000622">00:06:22</h2>

<p>If you put yourself in the shoes of a financial regulatory authority, and you have all these different participants out there doing stuff with computer systems, and something weird happens, and you’d like to come up with a total ordering of events of what led to this crazy thing – or what led to this good thing, who knows – but you want to have a total ordering of events. If people don’t have good clock synchronization, to some external source, you can’t compare the timestamp from participant A to the timestamp from participant B, so if you were to decree everybody must have time that is within some error bound, you know if these timestamps are within that error bound, well, then I can’t be sure about the ordering, but if they’re farther away than that then I can be sure about the ordering. I can know which one came first and which one came second, and that can be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="000655">00:06:55</h2>

<p>So that’s the motivation that’s very specific to our industry, but don’t people in other industries care a lot about clock synchronization, too? I would have thought that there are other reasons that would drive you to want to synchronize the machines on the network.</p>

<h2 id="000706">00:07:06</h2>

<p>Oh, sure. There’s lots of different things. I mean, just like a general sysadmin topic, a lot of times you want to gather logs from all the systems on your computer network, and you want to analyze them for various reasons. Maybe it’s because you’re concerned about intruders. Or maybe it’s because you’re just trying to understand the way things are functioning, and if your clocks aren’t synchronized it’s very hard to kind of understand things that might have happened on system B and how they relate to system A because the two timestamps are just not – you just can’t compare them if they’re not synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="000733">00:07:33</h2>

<p>And I suppose there are also some distributed systems, algorithmic reasons to want clocks. Certainly, some kinds of distributed algorithms end up using clocks as ways of breaking ties between systems, and so that requires at least some reasonable level of synchronization.</p>

<h2 id="000745">00:07:45</h2>

<p>For sure. There’s also other network protocols that are widely used that require clock synchronization, but much less precise levels of clock synchronization. Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol, and that requires that the clocks be synchronized to within five minutes, and the idea there is to thwart replay attacks, and stuff like that, making sure that somebody can’t obtain your credentials from a couple days ago and use them again, that kind of thing. So there, it’s like the error bars are very wide but there’s still some sort of synchronization necessary.</p>

<h2 id="000814">00:08:14</h2>

<p>Right. And I guess that’s a general theme when thinking about synchronization: different applications require different levels of synchronization, but more closely synchronized never hurts.</p>

<h2 id="000821">00:08:21</h2>

<p>There’s definitely tradeoffs as you start to get into the lower bounds, but yeah. If they were all free, sure, I’d like to have them exactly the same.</p>

<h2 id="000828">00:08:28</h2>

<p>How do people normally approach this problem of clock synchronization? What are the standard tools out there?</p>

<h2 id="000833">00:08:33</h2>

<p>Most people, you just kind of run whatever your distribution shipped as an NTP daemon. NTP stands for the Network Time Protocol, and it is a protocol that up until not that long ago, I just kind of assumed used some kind of magic, and it knows how to talk to some servers on the Internet or some local servers that you probably then having talking to servers on the Internet, and it synchronizes your clocks with those servers. It exchanges some packets, maybe it takes a little while, maybe a few minutes, maybe longer. You probably don’t understand exactly why, but eventually, your clocks are relatively in sync to within maybe tens, or so, of milliseconds.</p>

<h2 id="000905">00:09:05</h2>

<p>Can you give us a tour of how NTP actually works?</p>

<h2 id="000909">00:09:09</h2>

<p>Like I said, for a long time, I just kind of assumed it was magic and didn’t really think too hard about it, and then at some point, I got tasked, within Jane Street, to actually look at some of this stuff and try and meet some requirements that were a little bit harder than the sort of standard tens of milliseconds synchronization. So I actually went and just was like, “Okay. Well. How does NTP do this from first principles?” right? Like, let’s go read some of the papers from David Mills. Let’s just go see if we can actually reason this out ourselves. At the end of the day, it’s just four timestamps. There’s a lot more complicated stuff around it, but the sort of core of it is these four timestamps.</p>

<h2 id="001040">00:10:40</h2>

<p>Can you maybe explain what it is about the calculation that depends on the symmetry between the send time and the received time?</p>

<h2 id="001048">00:10:48</h2>

<p>Those delays are kind of what tie it together, right? You know that if the clocks were in sync you know that the timestamp that you took minus the timesstamp that I took should be equal to the delay of the packet to get to you, right? And vice versa. My timestamp, from the second one that I received, minus your timestamp should be equal to the delay that it took for the packet to get from you to me. And you’re like, “Well. What do I do with this information?” And you say, “What if I just assume that those two delays are equal?” and if I assume that those two delays are equal, then I can start rearranging the various pieces of the equation. And then that’s how you can actually solve for the delay and the offset.</p>

<h2 id="001122">00:11:22</h2>

<p>What’s the role of the two timestamps on the server-side? So, if you ask me what time it is, I write down when I receive it, and then I write down the time where I send it back. You could imagine a simpler protocol with just three timestamps. Then you just assume that that time that I wrote down happened in the middle of that interval, the interval between the time you sent the first method and received the second message.</p>

<h2 id="001146">00:11:46</h2>

<p>How do you know when in the middle is, right? There’s lots of vagaries that happen with operating systems like if you timestamp it on either end, as soon as you receive the packet you timestamp it, and then maybe you have to do some work, and then right before you send it back you timestamp it, and that’s sort of how you get closest to those differences I mentioned representing the actual network delay from one to the other.</p>

<h2 id="001204">00:12:04</h2>

<p>And I guess an extra assumption that you’re making here is that in that period between the first timestamp and the second timestamp you had better assume that the rate at which the clock is going forward is about right. I think that throws another error term into the equation. It’s, I think, typically extremely small, right? If you just, it certainly seems like something you can, in practice, ignore. Because if you just look at the number of parts per million, or whatever that you were talking about, in terms of how much drift there is in a real computer clock, I think that is, in fact, pretty tiny.</p>

<h2 id="001232">00:12:32</h2>

<p>Right, well you’ve got the correction being applied by the time daemon that’s running on the computer, which is keeping the clock in sync. Presumably, the server-side of this communication is also taking time from somewhere either reference clock or some sort of higher upstream stratum in NTP, like clocks that are better than it, something like a GPS receiver, and it has applied a sort of correction to the operating system to say, “Hey, I currently believe that the frequency is off by this much. Please correct that when you hand me back time.” So, I feel like your biggest – I guess to your point of being able to ignore in practice – your biggest concern would be if in between those two timestamps something massive changed, like the temperature rose or dropped by many, many degrees or something such that, that frequency correction was now just wildly incorrect.</p>

<h2 id="001315">00:13:15</h2>

<p>Okay, so we have now a network protocol. Put a timestamp, send a message, another timestamp, another timestamp, you get it back. Now the computer that started all this has some estimate for how much it’s clock is off. What does it do then?</p>

<h2 id="001327">00:13:27</h2>

<p>In the simple world, you could just set your time. You could just, you could just sort of say like, “And the time should be X,” but that’s not generally how most Network Time Protocol daemons work. What they’ll do is they’ll take a number of samples from a single server, but many times you have multiple servers configured so you’ll take many samples from multiple servers, and you’ll sort of apply different criteria to these things to decide if you should even consider them. I think the reference implementation of NTPD has this notion of a “popcorn spike,” where if your offset, you know, if you’ve gotten back 30 samples and they all kind of look about the same, but then you get one that’s wildly off, you just kind of say like, “I’m gonna ignore that one, because likely that was just due to some crazy queueing somewhere in the network or something like that.”</p>

<h2 id="001407">00:14:07</h2>

<p>You can sort of think of this as a kind of voting algorithm: You have a bunch of different oracles that are telling you things about what time is, you kind of bring them all together and have some way of computing an aggregate assumption about what the time currently is that tries to be robust to errors and drop outliers and the like.</p>

<h2 id="001423">00:14:23</h2>

<p>Yeah, I think that’s right. You try to pick out the people who are lying to you, right? Some of those servers you might be talking to upstream might just be telling you incorrect things. They’re generally referred to in sort of NTP parlance as falsetickers, and the ones who are not falsetickers are truechimers.</p>

<h2 id="001436">00:14:36</h2>

<p>Oh, that’s awesome.</p>

<h2 id="001438">00:14:38</h2>

<p>I’m not sure why exactly these are the names, but these are some of the names you might see if you’re looking around the internet. So you try and pick out the ones that are telling you the truth. You apply some other various heuristics to them to try and figure out which ones you think are the best, right? Which ones maybe have the smallest error bars – even though you might think that these are decent sources to use some of them might have wider error bars than others, right, like your samples may represent a sort of wider range than the other ones – so you try and figure out which ones are the best and then you use that to sort of tell your operating system to effectively speed up or slow down its frequency correction for how off it is, and try and sort of remove that error over time. You don’t just abruptly adjust the time that the system thinks it is. Most time daemons will not aggressively step the clock. The reason for that is that most applications do not enjoy when the time just changes drastically, especially not when it changes drastically in the negative direction.</p>

<h2 id="001526">00:15:26</h2>

<p>This highlights another property you want out of your clocks, which we haven’t touched on yet, which is: we said we want our clocks to be accurate. Your criterion for what it means for them to be right is you go to them and ask them what time it is, and they give numbers pretty close to each other. But there’s another property you want, which is you want the clocks to, in a micro sense, advance about a second per second and you especially want it to never go backwards, because there are lots of algorithms on a computer, which are making the assumption implicitly and you know, naively reasonably, that the clocks only go forward, and lots of things can get screwed up when you allow clocks to jump backwards.</p>

<h2 id="001600">00:16:00</h2>

<p>Right. So, a way that you can maintain that property that you just mentioned, while still correcting, is simply effectively tell the operating system like “Hey, slow down. I want to have time slow down effectively such that like this error gets removed, but I don’t have to actually step time backwards and make applications sad.”</p>

<h2 id="001614">00:16:14</h2>

<p>And I actually remember this, personally, from many years ago where the one place where I really intersected with clock synchronization in a serious way was, I was asked to look at Jane Street’s clock synchronization on its Windows machines. I wrote a small program that sent little NTP packets to the Windows machines, which knew the NTP protocol and responded appropriately. And they had the four timestamps on them, and instead of trying to compute the average I actually computed upper and lower bounds on how far the clock sync was off and generated a little graph to see what was going on. And I remember being quite surprised to discover that if you graphed how far off the clocks were you’d see this weird sawtooth behavior where the clocks would go out of sync, and then, bang, they would be in sync again, and then slowly out of sync and then in sync again. And that’s because the Windows NTP daemon we were running was configured to just smash the clock to the correct value and not do any of the kind of adjusting of the rate, which I think if I remember correctly, that’s called slewing, which is, I think, a term I’ve heard in no other context.</p>

<h2 id="001713">00:17:13</h2>

<p>Yeah, that is correct.</p>

<h2 id="001715">00:17:15</h2>

<p>Okay, so NTP lets you, in fact, do the slewing in an appropriate way so you can keep the rates pretty close to the real-time rates, but still, over time, slowly converge things back if they are far apart. In practice, how quickly can NTP bring clocks that are desynchronized back together?</p>

<h2 id="001731">00:17:31</h2>

<p>At least with some of the newer time daemons… so I don’t know what the default is for the reference implementation. I know with some of the newer daemons like chrony, the default is that it takes 12 seconds to remove one second of error. So depending on how far away you were you can sort of like work it out, right, 12 seconds to remove one second. So if you were a day, it’d be 86,400 times 12, which is a lot of seconds.</p>

<h2 id="001751">00:17:51</h2>

<p>So that’s actually quite fast, which means the rate at which the clock moves forward can be off by on the order of 10%, which is pretty aggressively pushing on the gas there.</p>

<h2 id="001801">00:18:01</h2>

<p>And these knobs are adjustable. If you really want to you can sort of change the max rate at which they will attempt to make these adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="001806">00:18:06</h2>

<p>So, we had clock synchronization working on our systems before you started in 2012, and yet you needed to redo it. What were we doing, and why did we have to redo it?</p>

<h2 id="001816">00:18:16</h2>

<p>So, we did what I’m sure lots of people do. We discussed GPS appliances before – so we have some GPS appliances, which are bringing us accurate-ish time, and then we pointed a bunch of time servers at those GPS appliances using NTP, and we pointed a bunch of clients at those time servers, and we sort of dusted our hands off and said, “Ah, done.” There was no real requirements around what is the maximum error. Are we trying to maintain anything? If you look at any given time can you tell us how far off any given system is from, say, UTC? And so that served us fine for a while. The main motivation for some of the work that was done was a bunch of different financial regulations that happened in Europe, but one of them specifically had to do with time synchronization, and what it said was that you have to be able to show that your clocks are in sync with UTC to within 100 microseconds. So the 100 microsecond number was the big change. At first, when we first heard this requirement. It’s like, “Well. Maybe we’re good. We don’t actually know at the moment like maybe we’re just fine.”</p>

<h2 id="001911">00:19:11</h2>

<p>Okay, and so we looked at it, and were we just fine?</p>

<h2 id="001913">00:19:13</h2>

<p>No, definitely not. So it was, I think I said it before, but like most systems were like a couple hundred microseconds out, but the real problem, or one of the real problems, was that they sort of would bounce all over the place. Like sometimes they could be relatively tight, say 150 microseconds, but various things would happen on the system that could disturb them and knock them, say, four or 500 microseconds out of alignment. If a bunch of systems all start on a given computer at the same time, and they all start using the processors very aggressively, that’ll fundamentally change the heat profile of the system. As the heat profile changes the frequency will change and then the time daemon might have a harder time keeping the correct time, because the frequency is no longer what it was before, and it has to sort of figure it out as it goes. </p>

<h2 id="002015">00:20:15</h2>

<p>What did you find?</p>

<h2 id="002017">00:20:17</h2>

<p>I definitely did the dumb thing, right, and I went to Google and I said, “How do you meet MiFID II time compliance regulations,” or something along those lines, and probably many different sort of combinations of those words to try and find all the good articles. If you just do that, what you find out is that everyone tells you should be using PTP, which is the Precision Time Protocol. It’s a completely different protocol. And if you go read on the internet, you’ll see that it is capable of doing “better time synchronization” than NTP, but nobody really tends to give you reasons. Lots of people will say things like “NTP is good to milliseconds. PTP is good to microseconds,” but without any sort of information backing that. So if you just do that, you’re like, “Well. We should clearly just run PTP. No problem. Let’s just do that.”</p>

<h2 id="002113">00:21:13</h2>

<p>Where does the precision of the Precision Time Protocol come from?</p>

<h2 id="002115">00:21:15</h2>

<p>Exactly. And what I found actually surprised me to some extent. The protocol is a little different. The sort of who sends what messages when is a little bit different. It involves multicast, which is different. But at the end of the day, it’s those same four timestamps that are being used to do the calculation, which I found a bit surprising. I was sort of like, “Now, if it’s the same four timestamps, more or less, what is it about PTP that makes it much more accurate?” And what I was able to find is, I think it’s basically three things. </p>

<h2 id="002326">00:23:26</h2>

<p>The idea is, I guess, you can do in some sense, the moral equivalent of what NTP does with the two middle timestamps. Where there are two timestamps in NTP that come from the server that’s reporting time. It’s like when it receives and then when it sends out and you get to subtract out from the added noise that gap between those two timestamps, and then the idea is you can do this over and over again across the network, and so delays and noise are introduced by, for example, queueing on the switch, would go away. Like you would essentially know how much those delays were and as a result, you could potentially be much more accurate.</p>

<h2 id="002401">00:24:01</h2>

<p>Yeah. I think that’s roughly the conclusion I came to, that that’s what makes PTP more accurate than NTP, which was surprising to me. And then I did a bunch of research and was talking to various people in the industry, and at various conferences and stuff, and there was some agreement that you can make NTP also very accurate you just have to control some of these things, so there are… in addition to being able to do hardware timestamping with PTP packets some cards, these days, support the ability to hardware timestamp all the packets, and if your machine is just acting as an NTP server and most of the packets it receives are NTP packets, well then you’re effectively timestamping NTP packets. Some cards also will timestamp just NTP packets. They can sort of recognize them and timestamp only those, but it was sort of like “Okay if we have the right hardware, we can get the timestamping bit of it. That’s kind of an interesting thing. With the different NTPD implementation, chrony being the other implementation I’m talking about as opposed to the reference one, you can turn that knob for how frequently you should poll your server, I think as much as like 16 times a second. There’s a bit of like diminishing returns there, it’s not always better to go lower… point being, you can tune it to at least match sort of what PTP’s default of once a second.</p>

<h2 id="002559">00:25:59</h2>

<p>It seems like in some sense, the design of PTP where it relies for its extra accuracy on these switches violates this old end-to-end property that people talk about as the design of the internet of trying to get as much of the functionalities you can around the edge of the system. And I think that is motivated by a lot of the kind of concerns you’re talking about: you have more control over the endpoints, and you want to rely on the fabric for as little as possible. I guess the other reason you want to rely on the fabric it’s not just that there are different groups, and like, “ Oh, it’s hard to work with people in different areas and coordinate.” It’s also in various ways, fundamentally harder to manage networks than it is to manage various other kinds of software, but the reality is, in many organizations, in many contexts, a lot of getting the network right involves an extremely good, extremely well trained, extraordinarily careful human being, just going in and changing the configs and not getting it wrong. It’s kind of a terrifying system, and the less complexity, you can ask the people who have to go in and do this terrifying thing of modifying the network, the less complexity you can ask them to take care of the better.</p>

<h2 id="002701">00:27:01</h2>

<p>I mean, that’s a very, very true point. And another aspect of it is having less black-box systems involved. So, chrony is an open-source project, we can sort of inspect the code and see what it’s doing and understand how it behaves. The GPS appliances are not but the idea of having less black-box systems where, “Hey, that’s really strange. Why did we see this spike? We have absolutely no idea.” The amount we can minimize that kind of stuff, the better.</p>

<h2 id="002722">00:27:22</h2>

<p>Right. The primary currency of the sysadmin is inspectability.</p>

<h2 id="002724">00:27:24</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2 id="002727">00:27:27</h2>

<p>You want to be able go in and figure out what the hell is happening.</p>

<h2 id="002730">00:27:30</h2>

<p>Yes. Huge proponent of things you can inspect and debug.</p>

<h2 id="002732">00:27:32</h2>

<p>You talked a bunch about hardware timestamping, and I have a kind of dumb and mechanical question about all this, which is you talked about essentially software processes keeping clocks up to date. You have this NTP daemon that knows how to adjust the rates of things and stuff, but then you talked about the NIC going in timestamping packets. So does the NIC have a hardware clock and the motherboard have a hardware clock, or the CPU? How are these clocks related to each other? What’s actually going on when you’re doing hardware timestamping?</p>

<h2 id="002801">00:28:01</h2>

<p>Yeah, the NIC also has a hardware clock.</p>

<h2 id="002803">00:28:03</h2>

<p>Is it a different time? Do you have to run NTP between the NIC and the host system?</p>

<h2 id="002808">00:28:08</h2>

<p>I think that would be challenging, but like yes, you can use a thing from the Linux PTP project to move time from a network card to the system. It’s called phc2sys. That’s just a thing you can do, You have time on your network cards, you can move that time to the system, you can move it from the system to another network card, you can kind of shift this time around in various ways. But yes, the cards themselves do also have a clock on them that you’re also keeping in sync.</p>

<h2 id="002830">00:28:30</h2>

<p>So another thing you mentioned about PTP is that it uses multicast. So, I’ve had the chance to sit down and talk at length with Brian Nigito, in a <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets/">previous episode</a> of this podcast, about multicast, and I’m curious what role multicast plays here in the context of PTP?</p>

<h2 id="002845">00:28:45</h2>

<p>The whole idea is that at the sort of root of this time distribution tree you have what’s known as a grandmaster, and you can have multiple grandmasters, and a grandmaster is just something that doesn’t need to be getting PTP, time from PTP. It’s like you know the GPS reference or something else. You have this grandmaster you can have multiple ones. There’s a thing called the best master clock algorithm for the participants of PTP to determine which of them is the best one to act as the grandmaster at any given time, and then the idea is that you multicast out these packets to say, “Here’s my first timestamp,” and it just makes it easier on the network. As a PTP client, you just have to come on and start listening for these multicast messages and then you can start receiving time, as opposed to you having to actually reach out and be configured to go talk to the server. You can just sort of have less configuration and start receiving these time updates from the grandmaster.</p>

<h2 id="002928">00:29:28</h2>

<p>Got it. So you think it’s mostly a kind of zero-configuration kind of story.</p>

<h2 id="002931">00:29:31</h2>

<p>It also makes it easier for the grandmaster. You don’t have to maintain these connections. You don’t have to have all these sockets open. You just sort of have like one socket there kind of multicasting out. It’s not 100% true, because there’s a delay request and a delay response message that’s involved in all this too.</p>

<h2 id="003037">00:30:37</h2>

<p>Yeah, the base behavior you’re describing sounds pathological, right? Essentially, quadratic. You get….</p>

<h2 id="003042">00:30:42</h2>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="003045">00:30:45</h2>

<p>Everyone sends a message to everyone. That is not usually a recipe for good algorithmic complexity.</p>

<h2 id="003047">00:30:47</h2>

<p>I’m not sure why it was designed that way. It could be that the original people were sort of thinking that you’d have these smaller domains where you have these boundary clocks. Or sort of you’re multicasting… you’re sort of limited to how many people you’re talking to. But I kind of agree the default behavior seems a little crazy to me, and that’s why in our case, where we are using PTP (we’re using it in a small area of the world) we have it configured to do that hybrid thing where the actual sync message comes in multicast, but the delay request and the delay response wind up being unicast. </p>

<h2 id="003212">00:32:12</h2>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<h2 id="003214">00:32:14</h2>

<p>It makes no sense whatsoever. The timestamp is off the charts. And we’ve had GPS appliances do things like that, and so part of my thinking through this was, you know, “Geez, at the end of the day I really don’t want to be pulled back to a single GPS appliance that is providing time to potentially large swathes of the network,” because if it goes crazy there’s no real provisions in PTP for finding the crazy person everybody will just follow those crazy timestamps wherever they lead.</p>

<h2 id="003241">00:32:41</h2>

<p>At least for a while. It sounds like there’s a way of eventually deciding someone else is the right one to pay attention to, but it means for short periods of time you may end up just listening to the wrong guy.</p>

<h2 id="003250">00:32:50</h2>

<p>I’m not an expert in exactly what’s involved in the best master clock algorithm, but I thought what was in the best master clock algorithm was simply about how good your clock was, and so if you were sitting there saying, “I have the best clock. It’s fantastic.” but then you’re telling people the completely wrong time because you had some kind of a bug or misconfiguration, you would continue to operate in that mode indefinitely.</p>

<h2 id="003309">00:33:09</h2>

<p>That’s fascinating. What it sounds like is despite the fact that PTP is newer, and, in some ways, shinier, and in some ways having fundamentally better capabilities for some aspect of what it’s doing, it also just threw out a bunch of the careful engineering that had gone into NTP over a long period, because NTP has significantly more robust ways of combining clocks than what you’re describing for PTP.</p>

<h2 id="003329">00:33:29</h2>

<p>Yes, that was my kind of interpretation of looking at all this stuff: it feels like we threw out a lot of the safety, and that makes me super nervous based on my experience with these devices.</p>

<h2 id="003337">00:33:37</h2>

<p>So here we are, we have an NTP solution that’s not working well enough, and a PTP solution that’s kind of terrifying. So, where’d you go from there?</p>

<h2 id="003347">00:33:47</h2>

<p>So, we’re trying to build a proof of concept. At the end of the day, we sort of figured, “All right. We have these GPS appliances.” We talked about hardware timestamping before on the GPS appliances, and how they can’t hardware timestamp the NTP packets, so that’s problematic. We thought, “How can we move time from the GPS appliances off into the rest of the network?” And so we decided that we could use PTP to move time from the GPS appliances to a set of Linux machines, and then on those Linux machines we could leverage things, like hardware timestamping, and the NTP interleaved mode to move the time from those machines onto machines further downstream. </p>

<h2 id="003509">00:35:09</h2>

<p>I see. And this was already built into existing NTP clients, this ability to take advantage of hardware timestamps by moving them to the next interaction. That’s not a thing you had to invent.</p>

<h2 id="003518">00:35:18</h2>

<p>Nope, it’s existed for a while, and it, I think given with the reference NTP implementation it can leverage timestamps taken at the driver level to do something similar, but chrony adds the ability to actually leverage hardware timestamps in the same fashion, sort of sending them in the next message so that they can calculate a more accurate difference.</p>

<h2 id="003534">00:35:34</h2>

<p>Because hardware timestamps are a relatively new invention of all of this, right? When NTP was designed I don’t think there was any devices that did hardware timestamping.</p>

<h2 id="003542">00:35:42</h2>

<p>I think that is true, and as I was saying before, when this all first came to fruition the things that supported hardware timestamping were PTP specific.</p>

<h2 id="003550">00:35:50</h2>

<p>Okay, so now you have an infrastructure where there’s a bunch of GPS devices, a layer of Linux servers, which get time via PTP from those GPS devices, and then act as NTP servers for the rest of the network.</p>

<h2 id="003605">00:36:05</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="003606">00:36:06</h2>

<p>So maybe I missed, why does that first layer have to use PTP rather than NTP?</p>

<h2 id="003611">00:36:11</h2>

<p>The major reason is that the GPS appliances… its apropos to what we were just talking about… The GPS appliances will hardware timestamp their PTP because they have dedicated cards for it, but they don’t hardware timestamp their NTP, so the quality of time that you’re getting off of the GPSes if you’re talking NTP to them – like, if you just remove the time servers and you have the clients talk directly to the GPS appliances, for example – it’s just going to be a lot lower quality. And to be honest, I don’t know if they support the interleaved mode of NTP, like it’s not something I ever really dug into. It sort of goes back to that black box thing of like, “Well, we can configure this thing in such a way that it spits out hardware timestamped PTP and be relatively confident that it’s doing that job.” But anything more esoteric gets a little dicey.</p>

<h2 id="003650">00:36:50</h2>

<p>Got it. And you solve the false ticker problem by basically having each Linux server that’s acting as a kind of NTP… marrying each one of those to an individual GPS device. So if that GPS device is crazy then the Linux server will say crazy things, but then things internally on the network are going to, in a fault-tolerant way, combine together multiple of these Linux servers and be able to use the high accuracy way of getting data from those servers.</p>

<h2 id="003715">00:37:15</h2>

<p>That’s exactly right. We constrain the servers that any given client can pick using various sort of knobs within chrony because we want to meet certain requirements, and so we would like to ensure that any given client is going to talk to his local NTP server as opposed to one that is, say, 600 microseconds away somewhere, because as soon as you go to talk to that one that’s 600 microseconds away, you introduce a lot of potential error. And so what we do is we force the NTP clients to talk to their local servers, and then we also configure them to talk to a bunch of other servers, which are sort of too far away to get very high accurate time, but we use them just as you described, to sort of call out and figure out if either of the two local ones have gone crazy. If both of the two local ones have gone crazy. Well, we’re kind of out of luck.</p>

<h2 id="003757">00:37:57</h2>

<p>How well did this all work in practice?</p>

<h2 id="003759">00:37:59</h2>

<p>It worked surprisingly well. So sort of designing the system coming up with a system that can do this stuff and remain fault-tolerant and all that is one thing, but then there’s also the other thing of show me, right, like show me that you’re within 100 microseconds of UTC. So that required understanding like, what are the errors? And that comes back to the sort of asymmetry question and understanding things like if the NTP daemon is not accepting updates from its server for whatever reason because maybe it thinks the server is crazy, or because it thinks that the samples it just took are incorrect like maybe you had a popcorn spike or something like that, it’ll do a thing where it’ll basically increment a number that represents its uncertainty about how much it might be drifting while not getting good updates from its server, and so you kind of have to add together all these different errors. </p>

<h2 id="003920">00:39:20</h2>

<p>It’s expensive in a few ways. It’s expensive in the physical hardware, you have to provision, but it’s also just expensive in the net complexity of the network, right? I think there’s a lot of reasons why we want to try and keep the network simple and having a whole separate network just sounds like a disaster from a management perspective.</p>

<h2 id="003934">00:39:34</h2>

<p>Agreed. Right. So I was like, “I really don’t want to go down that road.” So we sort of said, “Well. Let’s see what happens.” And so I was just saying, most of the time we can attest that we are better than 35 microseconds, you know, 35 mics of error worst case, but there are situations where you can cause that to fall over. You can… for example, we have some clients that don’t support hardware timestamping. They’re just older generation servers, they don’t have NICs with hardware timestamping. If on those things, you just saturate the NIC for five minutes solid you’re probably going to get your error bounds outside of 100 mics, just going to happen. But on newer machines that do support hardware timestamping you can do things like that, and still stay within 50 mics of UTC, which is pretty cool. </p>

<h2 id="004202">00:42:02</h2>

<p>So after all of this, not that I want to call this into existence, but imagine that there’s a new version of European regulations, MiFID III comes out and says, “Now you have to be within 10 microseconds.” Assuming that technology is still as it is now what would you have to do to get the next order of magnitude in precision?</p>

<h2 id="004222">00:42:22</h2>

<p>Not this. So I think probably you’d want to go to something like PTP, but probably not just PTP directly. There’s a thing called White Rabbit, which is kind of like some PTP extensions, basically. I think it might actually be completely formalized in the most recent PTP specification. But that is a combination of roughly PTP with synchronous ethernet. So synchronous Ethernet allows you to get syntonization across the network, so you can sort of make sure that the frequencies are the same.</p>

<h2 id="004248">00:42:48</h2>

<p>Can I ask you what the word syntonization means?</p>

<h2 id="004251">00:42:51</h2>

<p>It just basically means that those two, the frequencies are in sync. So it doesn’t mean that we have the same time, but it means that we are sort of advancing at the same rate.</p>

<h2 id="004258">00:42:58</h2>

<p>I see. So there are techniques, essentially, that let you get the rate the same without necessarily getting the clocks in sync first.</p>

<h2 id="004304">00:43:04</h2>

<p>Correct. And is my understanding that White Rabbit sort of uses this idea that you can have the rates the same, with PTP, to work out some additional constraints that they can solve and get sub-nanosecond time synchronization. I think we would have to put a lot more thought into the sort of reliability and redundancy story. I sort of discounted PTP because it didn’t necessarily have the best reliability/redundancy story. It’s not to say we couldn’t have figured out a way to make it work for us. We almost certainly could’ve. You could have two grandmasters, one sitting there as the primary doing its normal operation, one sitting there as a standby, and if the primary one goes crazy for some reason you, could have some automated tooling or something that an operator could use to take it out of service, and bring the secondary into service and only have maybe a minor service disruption. I can imagine us doing that work but given the problem, we were trying to solve it seemed not necessary. We can solve this problem using this existing technology, but I do think if we had to go much lower like you said an order of magnitude lower, we’d have to start looking at something else.</p>

<p>Well. Thank you, so much. This has been really fun. I’ve really enjoyed learning about how the whole wild world of clock synchronization is knit together.</p>

<h2 id="004414">00:44:14</h2>

<p>Well. Thank you, very much. It was a pleasure being here. It’s a pleasure talking about these things. It’s fun to try and solve these interesting, challenging problems.</p>

      <title>Tortured phrases: A dubious writing style emerging in science</title>

      <span>Abstract:</span>  Probabilistic text generators have been used to produce fake scientific
papers for more than a decade. Such nonsensical papers are easily detected by
both human and machine. Now more complex AI-powered generation techniques
produce texts indistinguishable from that of humans and the generation of
scientific texts from a few keywords has been documented. Our study introduces
the concept of tortured phrases: unexpected weird phrases in lieu of
established ones, such as &#39;counterfeit consciousness&#39; instead of &#39;artificial
intelligence.&#39; We combed the literature for tortured phrases and study one
reputable journal where these concentrated en masse. Hypothesising the use of
advanced language models we ran a detector on the abstracts of recent articles
of this journal and on several control sets. The pairwise comparisons reveal a
concentration of abstracts flagged as &#39;synthetic&#39; in the journal. We also
highlight irregularities in its operation, such as abrupt changes in editorial
timelines. We substantiate our call for investigation by analysing several
individual dubious articles, stressing questionable features: tortured writing
style, citation of non-existent literature, and unacknowledged image reuse.
Surprisingly, some websites offer to rewrite texts for free, generating
gobbledegook full of tortured phrases. We believe some authors used rewritten
texts to pad their manuscripts. We wish to raise the awareness on publications
containing such questionable AI-generated or rewritten texts that passed (poor)
peer review. Deception with synthetic texts threatens the integrity of the
scientific literature.

			              <p><span>Aleksandr Agapitov discussed the latest controversy surrounding his decision to lay off around 150 employees from Xsolla. He explained how exactly employee performance has been evaluated and what he thinks of people criticizing him.</span></p>
          <div>
			      <p><a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xsolla-logo.jpg"></a></p>
<p><span>An interview with Agapitov was</span><a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2021/08/06/my-formalno-esche-nikogo-ne-uvolili-my-skazali-kompaniya-vas-ne-tsenit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>published by Meduza</span></a><span> on August 6. Below is the summary of that interview.</span></p>
<h2><b>On Xsolla’s internal appraisal system</b></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The company’s decision regarding layoffs was inspired by Netflix, Harward, and other organizations that lay off 10% of the most unengaged and ineffective employees on a regular basis. However, Xsolla had no plans to fire these many people until it stopped growing by 40% year-over-year.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The performance rating system was implemented in early 2021. The company measures its employees’ efficiency on a 100-point scale, based on 30 characteristics. The list includes writing and reading articles in the internal Wiki, creating and closing task tickets, as well as dashboard activity and participation in internal meetings.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>According to Agapitov, writing and reading texts is way more efficient than making presentations. That’s why he thinks that every employee should read the information about the business and other companies in Xsolla’s Wiki. “Some people just didn’t really want to educate themselves or learn about the company’s plans. We offered them a generous severance pay,” Agapitov said.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Xsolla only tracks work logs, so the founder thinks that the company doesn’t violate employees’ privacy. He claimed that if a person’s “digital footprint” is not visible, they shouldn’t work at Xsolla.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The company also planned to implement the so-called “digital mirror,” so every employee could learn what AI thinks of their work and engagement. However, the development team wasn’t enthusiastic about this idea, so its rollout is pending.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Why did Xsolla lay off dozens of people at once?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The company analyzes its revenue twice a week, comparing figures year-over-year.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Xsolla’s revenue increased by 80% last year, thanks to the effect that the pandemic had on the games industry.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>However, the growth slowed down because the lack of offline events made it harder to attract new customers to the platform.</span></li>
<li><span>According to Agapitov, Xsolla stopped showing a 40% growth during the last six months, so he decided to reduce the staff.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>More details about the layoffs</b></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Roughly 150 laid-off employees account for a third of the company’s staff of around 500 people. The goal was to reduce the salary budget by ten percent, not to fire 10 percent of the employees. Agapitov was prepared to fire as many low-performing people from the bottom of the rating as necessary to achieve a 10% salary fund reduction.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Most layoffs happened in Perm, where Xsolla was initially founded. Agapitov fired six people from the US (out of 50 US-based staff) and two people from Asia (out of 12 employees working at the South Korean office).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The company laid off people specializing in different spheres. “Worst programmers, worst marketers, worst office managers, worst admins, and even worst accountants,” Agapitov commented.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Xsolla plans to cut 10% of its budget every 12 months until it starts showing at least a 40% growth again. The company is now looking for new talent in Asia and Europe.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Agapitov also admitted that his blunt statements could have scared a lot of employees. “I realize I’m having trouble with my emotional intelligence but I’m working on it,” he said.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Despite the mass layoffs, he isn’t afraid of possible investigations. He thinks that Xsolla hasn’t violated Russian labor laws and, formally, hasn’t fired anyone yet. “To all employees who received the letter, we said that the company doesn’t value you, so we will find you a better job with a better salary,” Agapitov commented. “Likewise, you aren’t interested in Xsolla’s future either. So here is your generous severance pay, good luck.”</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The Xsolla founder also realizes that some people might want to leave in the wake of this controversy. But he thinks that his company only needs engaged employees who care about their personal and professional growth.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Why does Agapitov think that he did everything right?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>He claimed that the US media would have seen the decision as quite positive, as Xsolla follows the “practices common for this region.”</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Agapitov went on to say how companies nowadays protect minorities and can be overly cautios if they have to fire their representatives, which can make these employees almost immune to layoffs. “Our algorithm-based solution is as unbiased as possible. Therefore, from the point of view of the US media and society, it is much better for us [to fire a person based on the algorithm] rather than some manager doing it, based on their own views,” he said.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>According to Agapitov, the whole controversy started because remote work in Russia is a huge problem. He claimed that some find it difficult to work from home, so if someone criticizes his decision, it is only because they realize that they are inefficient employees themselves.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The Xsolla founder also noted that the US PR firm he worked with doesn’t see this situation as a crisis for the company. “Whatever you tell the press, there are only two kinds of stories </span><span> —</span><span> stories of fear and stories of hope. Fear sells better, and this is a scary story that sells very well,” Agapitov said.</span></li>

      <title>Cleaning Up Git History</title>
      <link>https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/cleaning-up-git-history/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>A clean git commit history is often underrated and can be immensely useful to ease code reviews and understand changes in the future (potentially in the midst of an outage).</p>
<p>Of course we are talking about the final history here as committed to the shared repository, not the intermediate history while we are working on the code. Sometimes the intermediate history is good enough to be pushed directly, but this is actually fairly rare.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the history might seem tedious at first for marginal cosmetic benefits, but it gets much easier and faster with practice. Here I am collecting some tips for cleaning up a git commit history before publishing it to others, for example in the form of a pull request.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>Another good time to clean up the history is before merging, if we have added additional commits to address review comments. Don’t merge commits that just exist to address comments, fix the original bad commits.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-commit">What Makes A Good Commit?</h2>
<p>A clean commit history is one that is comprised only of good commits. But what makes a commit good? There are two parts to this, the content of the commit, and the commit description.</p>
<p>There are many standards for commit messages, but I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages">OTP commit guidelines</a> as the base. I then try to include any important technical and product consideration in the message, such as the motivation for the change, and maybe technical nuances such as alternative implementations considered and tradeoffs. See <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46">Dan Carley’s amazing example</a>.</p>
<p>The content of the commit is a bit more fuzzy, but here is what I am looking for:</p>
<p>Every commit should make sense by itself. There is a <em>just right</em> size for commits, where there is nothing to add and nothing to remove. We want to add/remove/change exactly one thing in each commit. If we are struggling to come up with a good commit summary, that is a hint that our commit is not well scoped. Ideally this means a reviewer can review our changes commit-by-commit. We try to tell a story in commits.</p>
<p>Every commit should be runnable, that is we should be able to <code>git
checkout</code> any commit and get a functional code base. This means no “<em>WIP</em>” commits or commit chains that only restore functionality at the end. This is important so that we can revert or rollback to any commit if things go sideways.</p>
<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
<p>Git is very flexible, and for many of the techniques described here there are faster ways of performing the same actions. I am describing multi-step methods which preserve several individual commits for longer, as it is much easier to combine two commits than to split a single commit.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Specifically I tinker a lot with the history, combining several of these techniques here, before I do the final interactive rebase to resolve all changes. This way I can change my mind halfway through without any trouble undoing anything.</span></span></p>
<p>We are also using the long version of all flags for educational purposes. Refer to the man pages for the short versions.</p>
<p>We will be making heavy use of interactive rebasing, which can be triggered with</p>
<div><pre><code><span>git</span> rebase --interactive <span>&lt;</span>ref<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Interactive rebase is incredibly powerful and can be used to perform many different operations. We can use it to avoid having to memorise many other commands that are specifically tailored to doing just one thing.</p>
<p>It is also usually used differently from regular rebasing, where we move one or several commits onto a different base (hence rebasing). When rebasing interactively we usually want to edit all commits between <code>HEAD</code> and <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> instead. Thus we need to chose <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> as the other end of the range we want to edit.</p>
<p>When you start an interactive rebase, a special file will be opened in <code>$EDITOR</code> with all commits in the rebase range and actions for them. Git will insert a guide below the list describing the available actions. Once we are happy with the actions, we confirm the plan and the actions resolve.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Think board games or <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Stack">card games</a>.</span></span></p>
<h3 id="rewriting-commit-messages">Rewriting Commit Messages</h3>
<p>While I encourage the writing of the full commit message directly at commit time, sometimes we can think of additions or changes to earlier commit messages. To change just the commit message of an existing commit, we can use:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>git</span> commit --fixup:reword=<span>&lt;</span>ref<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These commands create additional “fixup commits” which are appended to the end of our history. Each of them is linked to another commit via its title. To actually combine the two (or more), we use:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>git</span> rebase --interactive --autosquash <span>&lt;</span>ref<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This should setup the interactive rebase to do the right thing, so we just confirm the actions proposed by saving and closing the file.</p>
<h3 id="adding-to-existing-commits">Adding to Existing Commits</h3>
<p>Let us assume we have written a commit, and then notice a small change necessary that falls within the scope of this commit. Instead of writing a new commit, we want to just fix up the existing commit. This is done simply by running:</p>

<p>If we notice our error only after adding additional commits, and want to retroactively add a change to an earlier commit, this command becomes:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>git</span> commit --fixup=<span>&lt;</span>ref<span>&gt;</span>
<span># Could be a SHA, or also e.g. HEAD~2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just as before, this creates fixup commits that can be combined with an interactive rebase and the <code>--autosquash</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="combining-commits">Combining Commits</h3>
<p>If we have two already existing commits in our history that we would like to combine into a single one, we can use an interactive rebase, move the second commit after the first one if required, and select the <code>squash</code> option.</p>
<p>When resolving the rebase, git will stop at this point and open up a combined commit message for us. We definitely want to edit this one instead of sticking with the default concatenation of the two original messages.</p>
<h3 id="reordering-commits">Reordering Commits</h3>
<p>If we want to change the order of commits, you have guessed it, we can do this with an interactive rebase and just changing the order of the commits in the list.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-a-commit">Splitting A Commit</h3>
<p>If a commit turns out to contain several independent changes, we can opt to split the commit to isolate those changes. Again we use an interactive rebase, but this time we select the <code>edit</code> action for the commit we want to split. This will cause the rebase to pause when we reach this commit. At this point we want to use</p>

<p>and then start creating the new commits. We can use</p>

<p>to incrementally add sections of our files. This works best when editing existing files, as the patch interface is a bit lacking, but it works.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>Emacs users out there will probably be familiar with <a href="https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Staging-and-Unstaging.html">the vastly superior Magit interface</a>, which allows easy staging of individual lines.</span></span> We can then use</p>

<p>to create the new commits. Once we are done creating new commits replacing the old one, we can use</p>

<p>to finish the rebase.</p>
<h3 id="removing-a-commit">Removing A Commit</h3>
<p>If we find ourselves with a commit that we decide we just do not need anymore, we can simply remove it from the history. This could be a change that we made but later realised we did not need after all, or something like the GitHub “update branch” merge commit noise.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is just using an interactive rebase and selecting the <code>drop</code> action for the commit in question.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>The git man pages are split by command, so for documentation on <code>git
rebase</code>, check <code>man git-rebase</code>. The man pages are good, but more of a reference than a usage guide.</p>
<p><a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">Oh Shit, Git!?!</a> has a memorable domain and provides some information for how to perform self-rescue after a lot of git accidents.</p>
<p>As a parting note, when rewriting history and pushing frequently <code>--force-with-lease</code> is your friend.</p>

      <title>Revisiting Prechelt’s paper comparing Java, Lisp, C/C++ and scripting languages</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Revisiting Prechelt’s paper and follow-ups comparing Java, Lisp, C/C++ and scripting languages</h2>

<p>
A discussion on programming languages&#39; impact on productivity and program efficiency.
</p>
<p>Written on 24 Jul 2021, 02:54 PM  (Last updated on 31 Jul 2021, 04:34 PM)</p><p></p>

<p>In 1999, <a href="https://twitter.com/prechelt">Lutz Prechelt</a> published a seminal article on the COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM (October 1999/Vol. 42, No. 10)</p>

<p>In that paper, they analysed data from a study (which was run for another paper, as we’ll see later) where participants
were asked to solve a problem consisting of encoding phone numbers into a combination of
digits and words from a dictionary, presumably to make it easier for humans to remember phone numbers they might want
to recall later (this was in a time before mobile phones were widespread).</p>

<p>The same problem was later used by <a href="https://flownet.com/ron/">Ron Garret</a> (aka Erann Gat) in his short paper,
<a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/lisp-java.pdf">Lisp as an alternative to Java</a>,
henceforth <em>Lisp VS Java</em>, from the year 2000.</p>

<p>Both papers have been widely cited and continue to be <a href="https://arnuldondata.medium.com/julia-and-the-reincarnation-of-lisp-f60cacd5822c">linked to even today</a>.</p>

<p>In this article, I would like to revisit these papers, analyse their methodology and conclusions, and
try to find out whether anything has changed in the 21 years since those articles were published by writing my own
solutions to the problem as if I, myself, had participated in one of the studies.</p>

<p>I wrote a solution in Java without looking into any other solutions in order to find out how my solution (and Java 16)
would’ve done if it had participated.</p>

<p>After that, I analysed some other solutions and compared them against mine. Based on my findings and some comments by
Prechelt himself in his paper, I decided to write a second Java program to match a completely different strategy that
was commonly used in the more dynamic languages. I implemented the same algorithm also in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
in order to get an idea of how a very modern systems-language would do.</p>

<p>That should allow us to compare modern languages more directly by using
the same exact algorithm (to the extent possible), eliminating the potentially big differences that could arise from
the different algorithms chosen by the programmer.</p>

<h2>Overview of the studies</h2>

<p>All data used in Prechelt’s <em>Java VS C</em>, as well as the Java/C/C++ solutions used in <em>Scripting VS Java/C</em>, come from an
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2802132_A_controlled_experiment_on_the_effects_of_PSP_training_Detailed_description_and_evaluation">earlier study</a>
on a software development technique called PSP (Personal Software Process). This study actually ran between August 1996
and October 1998!</p>

<p>That means that some participants were actually using the very first release of the JDK!</p>

<p>The objective of that study had nothing to do with studying the differences between Java and C/C++, it was about investigating
how effective PSP was (the results indicated that, mostly, PSP practictioners had more predictable, stable performance
but also worked a bit slower).</p>

<p>55 graduate students participated in that study, 24 of which used Java, 9 used C, 13 used C++, and the other two used
Modula-2 and something called Sather-K! Most students came from either the PSP course or a Java Advanced Course.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this was the data the <em>Java VS C</em> paper was based on. It included 24 programs written in
Java, 11 in C++ and 5 in C.</p>

<p>The instructions given to participants of the study, slightly adapted for the <em>Lisp VS Java</em> article,
can be found at <a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/instructions.html">flownet.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a short description of the problem the participants had to solve:</p>
<pre>All programs implement the same functionality, namely a conversion of telephone numbers into word strings.

...

The conversion is defined by a fixed mapping of characters to digits as follows:

e j n q r w x d s y f t a m c i v b k u l o p g h z
0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9

The task of the program is to find a sequence of words such that the sequence of characters
in these words exactly corresponds to the sequence of digits in the phone number.
All possible solutions must be found and printed.
The solutions are created word by word and if no word from the dictionary can be inserted at some point
during that process, a single digit from the phone number can appear in the result at that position.
Many phone numbers have no solution at all.

which has instructions on how to easily add your solution to the current benchmark and run it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a nice problem, not too easy, but not very hard either. I found it interesting enough to want to participate
myself after I randomly stumbled upon it on the internet, 21 years after the study was published!</p>

<p>Apparently, I was not the only one. Ron Garret (who worked at Nasa at the time and later went to work at early Google)
found it interesting enough to run his own study (the already mentioned <em>Lisp VS Java</em> one), re-using the same
problem but asking only Lisp programmers to solve it. He got 16 solutions from <em>volunteers recruited from an Internet newsgroup</em>.</p>

<p>Even <a href="https://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>, who I consider a Computer Science celebrity, posted <a href="http://www.norvig.com/java-lisp.html">his own solution</a>
to the problem, written in <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a>, on his website.</p>

<p>What did they all find out?</p>

<p>Well, basically, that Java is slow, uses too much memory and that it takes at least as much effort as C or C++ to write
something using it. Also, at least in Prechalt’s case, that the difference between programmers is generally greater
than the difference between languages.</p>

<p>In their own words:</p>

<h3><em>Java VS C</em></h3>
<pre>As of JDK 1.2, Java programs are typically much slower than programs written in C or C++.
They also consume much more memory.
</pre>
<p>But also:</p>
<pre>However, even within one language the interpersonal differences between implementations
of the same program written by different programmers (bad/good ratio) are much larger
than the average difference between Java and C/C++.
</pre>
<h3><em>Scripting VS Java/C</em></h3>
<pre>... for the given programming problem, “scripting languages” (Perl, Python, Rexx, Tcl)
are more productive than conventional languages.

In terms of run time and memory consumption, they often turn out better than Java and
not much worse than C or C++.
</pre>
<p>And again:</p>
<pre>In general, the differences between languages tend to be smaller than the typical differences
due to different programmers within the same language.
</pre>
<h3><em>Lisp VS Java</em></h3>
<pre>... Lisp’s  performance is comparable to or better than C++ in execution speed ...
it also has significantly  lower  variability, which translates into reduced project risk.

Furthermore, development time is significantly lower and less variable than either C++ or Java.

Memory consumption is comparable to Java...
</pre>
<h2>Analysis of the experiments and their conclusions</h2>

<p>Prechelt describes in detail the setup of his experiments and the profile of participants, as well as the many caveats
involved in each study. I highly recommend skimming through the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2802132_A_controlled_experiment_on_the_effects_of_PSP_training_Detailed_description_and_evaluation">PSP paper</a>
that kicked off his later publications.</p>

<p>Notice that there were two different groups of students in the original study: PSP students, who had learned how to
use a technique (PSP) to explicitly increase the quality of their work, and the <em>control group</em>,
mostly students from a Java course who were obliged to participate in the study. Most of the C/C++ submissions
originated from the PSP group (17 VS 5), but the Java submissions were more evenly divided (14 VS 10).</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that PSP students had been conditioned to spend more time analysing the problem and attempting
to prevent defects in their programs, and that the most important requirement of the study was for programs to be
as reliable as possible.</p>

<p>This implies some difference in the <em>types</em> of students working in Java VS C/C++. In <em>Java VS C</em>, Prechalt even mentions
that <em>on average, the Java programmers had only half as much programming experience in Java as the C/C++ programmers
had in C/C++</em>, which is natural given that the study ran when Java had just barely been released for the first time.</p>

<p>Anyway, in both the PSP paper and <em>Java VS C</em>, Prechelt was very sincere about the limitations of the study and
his conclusions were pretty solid given the data (and the fact they were using Java 1.2, released in 1998).</p>

<p>However, things get murkier with <em>Scripting VS Java/C</em>. Notice that Prechelt uses the same data again for the Java and
C/C++ programs, but for the group of scripting languages, the participants were basically random people found on
early internet groups:</p>
<pre>The Perl, Python, Rexx, and Tcl programs were all submitted in late 1999 by volunteers after I had posted a 
“Call for Programs” on several Usenet newsgroups (comp.lang.perl.misc, de.comp.lang.perl.misc, comp.lang.rexx, 
comp.lang.tcl, comp.lang.tcl.announce, comp.lang.python, comp.lang.python.announce) and one mailing list 
(called “Fun with Perl”, fwp@technofile.org).
</pre>
<p>Notice also that the time taken to solve the solutions was self-reported and the script language participants were not
monitored in any way, quite unlike those who took part in the first study (many of whom had been conditioned to spend
more time thinking about the problem, as PSP encouraged).</p>

<p>Prechelt mentions that <em>the work times reported by the script programmers may be inaccurate</em>. Well, this is probably the
biggest understatement in all of his papers.</p>

<p>The paper finds that the scripts’ median time was 3.1 hours, compared to 10.0 hours for the non-script group.</p>

<p>Notice that depending on how you look at the data, you could also have concluded that the participants who self-reported
their times were 3 times faster than those who were actually monitored.
More than half of the students in the original PSP study spent more than a working day on the problem, and they were not
only using Java in that study, but basically whatever language they wanted to use (though Prechelt seems to have only
used the Java results in his later paper)!</p>

<p>There’s some more interesting findings, though. For example, the fact that scripts were two to three times shorter than
non-scripts, and that there’s conflicting results regarding differences in the reliability of programs, a finding that
has been puzzling many other study’s authors, specially in the area of static VS dynamically typed languages (as that
suggests that using static types do not actually result in more reliable programs).</p>

<p>If Prechelt was mostly forthcoming in pointing out caveats to his findings, Garret was much less so.</p>

<p>It’s unclear how the data was collected for his study as the procedure was not described at all apart from a note saying
that <em>to the extent possible we duplicated the circumstances of the original study</em>. Given that the participants were
recruited from internet groups, I doubt that the subjects were monitored in place, which makes me think that the
<em>Development time</em> data collected should be taken with a giant grain of salt. However, the reported times do seem
similar to the scripting group self-reported times in Prechelt’s study: 2 to 8.5 hours for Lisp users, 3 to 10 for
the scripting group in Prechelt’s study.</p>

<p>Prechelt makes an interesting observation regarding that:</p>
<pre>... an old rule of thumb, which says that programmer productivity measured in
lines of code per hour (LOC/hour) is roughly independent of the programming language.
</pre>
<p>He uses that reasoning to conclude that, if that’s true, the self-reported times should not be far from reality.</p>

<p>Anyway, Garret goes much further and claims in his conclusion:</p>
<pre>Lisp  is  superior  to  Java  and  comparable  to C++ in runtime, and it is superior
to both in programming effort and variability of results.
</pre>
<p>That’s quite a strong conclusion.</p>

<p>He asks himself in his paper:</p>
<pre>why, if Lisp is so great, is it not more widely used?
</pre>
<p>Based on a small study like Garret’s, I find that the premise that <code>Lisp is so great</code> is unwarranted. Sure, he may
be using his own experience and perhaps others’ testimonies to take that as a fact, but in a paper like that, you must
provide your sources when making swiping statements such as this one. Personal feeling is not good enough.</p>

<p>However, the data does suggest that Lisp is about as productive as the scripting languages of the day and has a speed
comparable to C and C++, which is indeed a remarkable achievement.</p>

<h2>My own experience solving the phone number problem</h2>

<p>I came across Prechelt’s phone number problem when reading an <a href="https://arnuldondata.medium.com/julia-and-the-reincarnation-of-lisp-f60cacd5822c">article about Julia</a>
in which the author said:</p>
<pre>My heart was broken because Common Lisp is such a fine fine language
and it is a joy to work in and hardly anyone uses it in industry.
The industry has a lot of code in Java even when it takes **much less time** to write code in Lisp.
What happened to the programmer’s time is more important than the machine’s?
</pre>
<p>The <em>source</em> for such statement was Garret’s <em>Lisp VS Java</em>. I was fascinated by the conclusion of that paper when
I first read it, so I decided to “participate” in the study to see if their conclusions had been realistic and if,
perhaps, Java 16 (latest version as of writing) improved at least a little bit compared to the greatness
of Common Lisp.</p>

<p>I read the instructions linked from Garret’s paper and immediately started working on it.</p>

<p>What follows is a brain dump I wrote just as I finished my solution.</p>

<h3>Working on the problem</h3>

<p>I managed to write all the boilerplate code (read input, clean it up, collect and print results, basic tests) in just
about 1 hour. Meanwhile, I was deciding the best strategy to make the solution efficient and decided to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> data structure, which was already familiar to me.</p>

<p>It took me another hour or so to write a basic solution to the problem with a few more tests based on the examples
given in the instructions… but actually finishing the
algorithm off, unfortunately, took me some more time (I don’t write algorithms like that every day), specially because
of a small bug that I couldn’t easily figure out how to fix (I was trying to
<em>inject</em> a digit when I could not find a word on any position, instead of only at the beginning of a potential word…
once the reason was found, it was trivial to fix).</p>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>All in all, I estimate <strong>my total time was around 3.5 hours</strong>. That’s almost twice as much as Norvig, but at least I can take
some comfort in knowing I managed to do quite well when compared with other participants in the study (again, those who
were actually monitored, and did not just self-report): <strong>3 to 25 hours for C/C++, 4 to 63 hours for Java</strong>.</p>

<p>The non-monitored participants reported between <strong>2 to 8.5 hours for Lisp</strong>, and <strong>around 1 to 10 hours for the scripting
languages</strong>.</p>

<h3>Lines of code</h3>

<p>My solution required <strong>167 lines of code</strong> using Java 16, compared with a range of <strong>51 to 182 for Lisp</strong>,
<strong>107 to 500+ for Java</strong>, <strong>130 to 500+ for C/C++</strong>, <strong>around 50 to 200</strong> for the scripting languages.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>To measure performance, I downloaded a few files from <a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/">this page</a>, including
<a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/dictionary.txt">dictionary.txt</a>, <a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/input.txt">input.txt</a>
and <a href="https://flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/output.txt">output.txt</a>.</p>

<p>Because computers have come a long way in the last 21 years, the original input file and dictionary were far too small
to make the programs run for more than a second! So I had to
<a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/prechelt-phone-number-encoding/blob/master/src/java/util/GeneratePhoneNumbers.java">generate some longer inputs</a>
in order to get a better sense of how performant my solution was.</p>

<p>Given that none of the studies seem to have published the solutions they collected, I used Peter Norvig’s CL
implementation as the baseline.</p>

<p>In <em>Lisp VS Java</em>, most Common Lisp solutions had very similar speed and memory usage, so I assume Norvig’s
implementation would also be close to the others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can read the full instructions to run the test yourself on this <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/prechelt-phone-number-encoding">GitHub Repository</a>,
which includes my solution, several others I found around the internet, besides the ports I did of Norvig’s
solution to Java and Rust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results of this analysis will be shown in the next section after we discuss the different strategies that can be
used to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Comparing solution strategies</h2>

<p>Prechelt noticed that there were basically two main approaches in the solutions he analyzed:</p>
<pre>Most of the programmers in the script group used the associative arrays provided
by their language and stored the dictionary words to be retrieved by their number
encodings.

The search algorithm simply attempts to retrieve from this array, using prefixes
of increasing length of the remaining rest of the current phone number as the key.
Any match found leads to a new partial solution to be completed later.

In contrast, essentially all of the non-script programmers chose either of the following
solutions.

In the simple case, they simply store the whole dictionary in an array, usually in both
the original character form and the corresponding phone number representation.
They then select and test one tenth of the whole dictionary for each digit of the phone
number to be encoded, using only the first digit as a key to constrain the search space.
This leads to a simple, but inefficient solution.

The more elaborate case uses a 10-ary tree in which each node represents a certain digit,
nodes at height n representing the n-th character of a word.
A word is stored at a node if the path from the root to this node represents the number
encoding of the word.

This is the most efficient solution, but it requires a comparatively large number of
statements to implement the tree construction.
</pre>
<p>This analysis is spot on in my opinion! My solution turned out to be the one he called <em>the most efficient</em> one (he’s describing
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> data structure), Norvig’s solution was exactly the one
<em>most of the script group</em> came up with, which was easier to implement.</p>

<p>This difference in strategy has obvious consequences to the length of each program, as well as its efficiency. So when
we compare programs that use widely different strategies, we cannot really extrapolate our conclusions to differences
in the languages being used. In other words, programs that used the trie strategy (most of the non-scripting ones)
are going to be longer than the ones that used associative arrays (most of the scripting ones) regardless of the
language used.</p>

<p>However, it is still quite interesting to note that the language seems to somehow guide programmers to use one or
another strategy.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>To see what would’ve happened if I had chosen Norvig’s strategy instead of using a Trie, I decided to port his CL code
as closely as possible to Java.</p>

<p>I did the same thing targeting Rust as well in order to get a baseline for how fast the algorithm could go
(or so I thought).</p>

</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Rust solution gets very slow with a higher number of inputs. I asked Rust developers on the Rust Discord Channel
for help figuring out why it was so slow, but after several suggestions, the results did not improve significantly
(the result shown above includes some suggestions). I even generated a
<a href="https://renato.athaydes.com/images/prechelt-study-analysis/flamegraph.svg">flamegraph</a> to profile the Rust code,
but was unable to find any quick fix.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT (2021-07-31): the Rust code I wrote for this benchmark has several issues, which I decided to discuss
at length in my <a href="https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/how-to-write-slow-rust-code.html">next blog post</a>!</p>

<p>Please consider reading that article once you’re done reading this one :).</p>

<p>If you don’t have time: Rust can run much faster, but so can the other languages, and it turns out that the
Java implementation might run faster than the Rust fastest implementation, according to the new benchmarks
I’ve run after many Rust developers came to assist in making Rust faster. Common Lisp may have fallen behind,
but that’s likely just because it was not nearly as optimised as the Java and Rust implementations were.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite unexpectedly, Common Lisp was the best language overall, running the fastest with all but the largest input size
(and even then, it was beaten only by a different algorithm implemented in Java) and consuming very little memory.</p>

<p>Java still appears to consume much more memory than low-level languages (Rust in this case) and, these days, even than
Common Lisp (see my remarks above about tweaking the JVM memory settings, which don’t really help). On the other hand,
it can be very fast.</p>

<p>The Rust solution shows how little memory can be necessary to run through any number of inputs (the memory is the same
for any input size, which is expected as most of the memory is taken up by loading the dictionary), but has some
unfortunate performance degradation with an increased number of inputs (see notes above).</p>

<p>This seems to indicate that even when speed is of the essence, using Rust may not give automatic wins.</p>

<h2>Language comparison</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/prechelt-phone-number-encoding/blob/master/src/java/Main2.java">Java port</a> (<code>Java 2</code>)
has 99 LOC VS 74 LOC for the <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/prechelt-phone-number-encoding/blob/master/src/lisp/main.lisp">original CL</a>.
Most of the extra lines in Java are actually from a couple of functions I had to implement by hand:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; append( List&lt;T&gt; list, T item )</code> - needed in order to recurse under each arm of the Trie without affecting
the current, partial solution.</li>
<li><code>char[] removeIfNotLetterOrDigit( char[] chars )</code> - CL has a nice way of doing this by combining existing functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two functions took 19 lines, so if we discount them, the Java LOC goes down to 80 lines, very close to the Lisp
solution! Notice also that Lisp programmers like to close <em>blocks</em> on the same line. If we did the same in Java, moving
all <code>}</code> into the previous line, we could remove another 23 lines, bringing the Java solution to 57 LOC.</p>

<p>That’s not surprising when you look at the code (with comments removed):</p>

<p>Java is definitely more awkward, but not really very different.</p>

<p>I am not mentioning this to make Java look better than it is, but to show how LOC measurements can be misleading and how
Java has actually come a long way since 1998.</p>

<p>The Rust port required 116 LOC (though it had to use libraries for things the other languages have in their standard libraries),
which is not bad for a lower level language.</p>

<p>For comparison with the Java and Lisp code shown above, here’s the most important function in the Rust solution:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>print_translations</span>(
    num: <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span>,
    digits: <span>&amp;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>char<span>&gt;</span>,
    start: <span>usize</span>,
    words: <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    dict: <span>&amp;</span><span>Dictionary</span>,
) -&gt; <span>io</span>::<span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span>()<span>&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> start <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span> digits.len() {
        print_solution(num, <span>&amp;</span>words);
        <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(());
    }
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> n <span>=</span> ONE.clone();
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> found_word <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> start..digits.len() {
        n <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>n <span>*</span> (<span>&amp;</span><span>*</span>TEN) <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span>nth_digit(digits, i);
        <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(found_words) <span>=</span> dict.get(<span>&amp;</span>n) {
            <span>for</span> word <span>in</span> found_words {
                found_word <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
                <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> partial_solution <span>=</span> words.clone();
                partial_solution.push(word);
                print_translations(num, digits, i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>, partial_solution, dict)<span>?</span>;
            }
        }
    }
    <span>if</span> <span>!</span>found_word <span>&amp;</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>!</span>words.last().map(<span>|</span>w<span>|</span> is_digit(w)).unwrap_or(<span>false</span>) {
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> partial_solution <span>=</span> words.clone();
        <span>let</span> digit <span>=</span> nth_digit(digits, start).to_string();
        partial_solution.push(<span>&amp;</span>digit);
        print_translations(num, digits, start <span>+</span> <span>1</span>, partial_solution, dict)
    } <span>else</span> {
        <span>Ok</span>(())
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The Rust code is less <em>noisy</em> than Java, mostly due to type inference and operator overloading, but otherwise it’s
also not very different from either Lisp or Java, discounting unimportant syntax differences.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the CL program runs faster than either Java or Rust and consumes much less memory than Java, and not much
more than Rust!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rust solution’s performance seems to scale very badly with the number of inputs. I am not a Rust expert, so
 unfortunately I could not pinpoint what’s going on there (I did try to improve it without success), but my suspicion
 is that the <code>num-bigint</code> crate is not implementing <code>BigUint</code> as efficiently as Java and Lisp do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Regarding the studies reviewed in this article, I think it’s fair to conclude the following:</p>

<h3><em>Java VS C</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>it was a great paper in general.</li>
<li>good discussions about its own weaknesses.</li>
<li>its conclusions were generally accurate but reflect the state of things in 1999.</li>
<li><em>Java programs are typically much slower than C and C++</em> seems to not be accurate today, at least if we accept that
the Rust results would be comparable to C and C++.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future work should definitely include C and C++ in the comparison, and implement the Trie approach also in those
languages as perhaps Rust cannot always be used a proxy to C and C++ performance as I had assumed.</p>

<h3><em>Scripting VS Java/C</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>very weak results due to the different methodology with which the participants were selected and monitored.</li>
<li>failed to sufficiently compensate for the fact that most of the Java and C/C++ participants were trained in
a specific software development technique that biased their results.</li>
<li>interesting observations regarding the LOC/time rate and how it tends to not vary between languages.</li>
<li>its conclusion that program reliability does not vary significantly by language seems persuasive.</li>
</ul>

<h3><em>Lisp VS Java</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>very strong claims that nevertheless appear to generally stand to scrutiny.</li>
<li>lack of rigour when describing methodology significantly weakens the paper’s standing.</li>
<li>the conclusion that Common Lisp has speed comparable to C/C++ (assuming Rust to be a good proxy) seems accurate,
at least for Prechelt’s problem.</li>
<li>the conclusion that it requires lower effort than Java is not nearly as strong as it was back in the year 2000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Garret’s paper would probably have benefited from feeling less of a Lisp-chill and being more based on hard evidence,
of which it did have some.</p>

<h3>Final remarks</h3>

<p>In general, I believe what we can take from this discussion is:</p>

<ul>
<li>LOC depends a lot on the specific algorithm used, so comparing languages based on all solutions combined is flawed.</li>
<li>Language choice impacts the algorithms programmers tend to choose (indirectly amplifying language effects on
program efficiency and effort required).</li>
<li>The variance in amount of effort between programmers (specially due to their <em>a priori</em> knowledge and ability to choose
appropriate solutions for a problem) far eclipses variance due to the language chosen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given all of the above, I think we have enough evidence to believe that the choice of a programming language has
less impact than the papers discussed here appear to imply. Still, it does have a significant impact on many factors
(e.g. Java is fast but requires a lot of memory,
Rust does not automatically make everything faster but does decrease memory usage by a good margin, Lisp and
scripting languages guide programmers to make use of higher level algorithms that are easier to implement and, at least
in some cases, perform as well as lower level languages).</p>

<p>Choosing the appropriate algorithm to solve a problem will generally have much more impact in both efficiency and amount
of effort required than using a particular language. Care must be taken, however, to avoid language choice guiding
programmers towards the use of less efficient (or more time-consuming, depending on the priorities of a project)
algorithms/patterns.</p>

<p>Languages with extensive libraries might help both by providing out-of-the-box algorithm implementations
(e.g. a ready-to-use <code>Trie</code>) that are highly efficient and require no effort by the programmer to use,
and by avoiding programmers having to even make decisions about algorithms in the first place (e.g. by providing a solution to a
higher level problem that might use different algorithms/implementations under the hood, unbeknownst to the programmer
using it, like sorting functions).</p>

<p>This might actually partially explain why Lisp never became mainstream (it makes libraries less necessary, but that
backfires in some cases where a library could’ve solved the problem better and faster than what the Lisp programmer
would’ve come up with), but a language like JavaScript, which has been heavily focused on library sharing, did
(ignoring the heads-up it has had due to being the only choice in front-end web development for a long time).</p>

<p>Finally, when choosing a language at a larger company where many developers must work on the same code base,
the factors considered in the discussed papers and in this article may be much less relevant than the factors impacting
the ability of the language to facilitate large scale code bases.</p>

<p>Therefore, choosing a programming language requires
taking into consideration not only factors such as its speed, <strong>single</strong> developer effort and its resource usage
(the factors discussed here) but also things like its type system (which may help reason about code or just make
everything too hard to change), modularity (separation of concerns), simplicity (code is easier to read when it’s simple),
expression power (more concise code can be a benefit or a curse) and so on.</p>

      <title>Why WebAssembly is innovative even outside the browser</title>
      <link>https://www.tetrate.io/blog/wasm-outside-the-browser/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_tetrate_io_blog_wasm-outside-the-browser_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>WebAssembly (Wasm) has many applications in the cloud-native world today – WASI, edge cloud computing, Proxy-Wasm, and cloud-native runtime for serverless functions, to name a few. The question is, why has WebAssembly become so popular? </span><span id="more-33308"></span></p>
<p><span>To answer this, let’s begin by looking at the basic properties of WebAssembly.</span></p>
<p><span>WebAssembly is a safe, portable, and low-level binary instruction format. To elaborate on a few of the key properties of WebAssembly, it’s:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Safe: </b><span>It can safely run untrusted codes in a sandbox environment.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Open: </b><span>This means that it is embeddable. It has a customizable interface with external environments. For example, in WASI, WebAssembly can run on abstracted operating system platforms. Another example is Proxy-Wasm: the Wasm module communicates with external proxy applications to manipulate or handle traffic such as HTTP, UDP, or TCP traffic.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Portable:</b><span> It is usable across environments and is architecture-independent.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Polyglot: </b><span>It can be compiled from many programming languages.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It’s also fast.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There are clearly other existing solutions to achieve goals similar to what WebAssembly does, but as we will see, each of these solutions has certain limitations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>NaCI</b><span> is Google’s software fault isolation (SFI) solution. It is safe, embeddable, and polyglot. It can run untrusted codes with the application of SFI techniques. However, since NaCl is based on native binary, it is not a portable solution.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>eBPF</b><span> is a safe, embeddable, and portable program primarily used for kernels. However, due to its strict limitations, it is hardly polyglot.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Lua</b><span> is a powerful embeddable scripting language, but it’s not polyglot either.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Native Library Formats</b><span> are embeddable. However, they are not safe or portable.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Java</b><span> is a versatile language that runs anywhere. The downside is that isolated entities are not Java’s first-class citizens.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Accordingly, none of these alternative solutions demonstrates all the properties embodied in WebAssembly. On the other hand, WebAssembly is as portable as Java, as safe as NaCl or Seccomp, as embeddable as Lua, and as polyglot as Native Library. Compared to existing solutions on the market, WebAssembly is an excellent new solution with a well-rounded design that aims to meet multiple goals simultaneously. While other existing solutions are lacking in some respect, WebAssembly emerges as a successful solution to achieve what the others cannot. To sum up, WebAssembly’s unique strengths help it stand out among the crowd in the cloud-native world.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Strengthening application extensibility and security with WebAssembly</strong></h2>
<p><span>Like Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), the object format of the executable file in Linux, WebAssembly is an object format. As Linux defines what APIs an executable file can use, the external Wasm embedded interface defines the functions and symbols imported/exported by a Wasm module. This gives rise to various interface types for WebAssembly.</span></p>
<p><span>Embedding WebAssembly in applications is important for the following reasons. First, WebAssembly provides secure extensibility mechanisms for applications. Second, application and Wasm modules communicate through bi-directional ABI and API. Lastly, WebAssembly allows users to install extensions securely, portably, and in any language.</span></p>
<p><span>Two prime examples of a Wasm embedded interface are: WebAssembly for Proxies (Proxy-Wasm), and the WASI executable interface. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How Envoy’s extensibility evolves with Proxy-Wasm</strong></h2>
<p><span>For the purpose of this article, let’s focus on the secure extension mechanism of Proxy-Wasm. Powered by WebAssembly, Proxy-Wasm is an extensibility interface for proxy servers. Envoy serves as the reference implementation. Proxy-Wasm provides a secure and portable way to manipulate proxy traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Before WebAssembly, Envoy offered the static C++ library as its extension mechanism. No isolation was provided, and C++ was the only language that was supported. Therefore, updating an extension used to always require a rebuild.</span></p>
<p><span>Ever since its adoption of WebAssembly, Envoy’s extension has been able to run securely in an isolated environment. This approach has the distinct advantage of being language-independent, and there is full support for dynamic loading extensions.</span></p>
<p><span>WebAssembly brings secure extensibility mechanisms to cloud-native applications. Envoy and Istio provide a secure extensibility mechanism for application meshes powered by Proxy-Wasm. With WebAssembly, you can write your Envoy extensions, such as custom authorization and authentication, as well as logging.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Recap</strong></h2>
<p><span>WebAssembly’s unmatched strength of being embeddable, safe, polyglot, and portable all at the same time have led to the development of various Wasm interfaces. As we have seen, a secure extensibility mechanism is typically found in these interfaces. The extensibility mechanism for proxies, Proxy-Wasm, is an excellent example that allows users to extend their application meshes securely. With its unique set of advantages, WebAssembly is sure to continue to bring about new secure extensibility mechanisms to the cloud-native landscape.</span><span><br/>

      <title>What Irony Is Not (2020)</title>
      <link>https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/what-irony-is-not/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___thereader_mitpress_mit_edu_what-irony-is-not_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A handy guide to distinguishing the notoriously slippery concept from its distant cousins coincidence, satire, parody, and paradox.</p><figure></figure><p>“Irony” is a term that everyone uses and seems to understand. It is also a concept that is notoriously difficult to define. Much like Winona Ryder’s character in the 1994 rom-com “Reality Bites,” whose inability to describe irony costs her a job interview, we know it when we see it, but nonetheless have trouble articulating it. Even worse, it seems as if the same term is used to describe very different things. And following your mother’s advice — to look it up in the dictionary — is liable to leave you even more confused than before.</p><p>Uncertainty about irony can be found almost everywhere. An American president posts a tweet containing the phrase “Isn’t it ironic?” and is derided for misusing the term. A North Korean dictator bans sarcasm directed at him and his regime because he fears that people are only agreeing with him ironically. A song about irony is mocked because its lyrics contain non-ironic examples. The term has been applied to a number of different phenomena over time, and as a label, it has been stretched to accommodate a number of new senses. But exactly how does irony differ from related concepts like coincidence, paradox, satire, and parody? <strong></strong></p><h3><strong>Coincidence</strong></h3><p>In everyday conversation, the term “coincidence” is often used as a synonym for situational irony. For example, someone might rhetorically exclaim, “Isn’t it ironic that the rain stopped just as I was finishing my morning run?” In many such instances, “coincidence” would probably be a better descriptor, particularly when no greater meaning or import connects the two events. Things happen all the time, and sometimes things happen at the same time. But does that make such juxtapositions ironic? And does it truly matter what we call them?</p><p>Referring to coincidences as ironic raises the hackles of prescriptivists, who regard such usage with clear distaste. For them, it represents a form of imprecision that debases the language — an unforced error that one should scrupulously avoid. From a family resemblance perspective, we might say that the concept of coincidence overlaps to some degree with the irony concept, but the number of attributes the two share is low. Coincidences involve juxtaposition and incongruity, but they aren’t counterfactual and don’t involve pretense. They may allude to failed expectations, but they aren’t explicit echoes. Coincidences may involve victims, humor, or criticism, but they are rarely truly humorous or poignant. In short, the family resemblance between coincidence and irony makes them more like cousins than siblings.</p><p>The battle over equating irony and coincidence has been raging for some time. The first edition of “Fowler’s Modern English Usage” (1926) claims that “a protest is needed against the application … of ‘irony’ … to every trivial oddity.” Seventy years later, the third edition admitted that “this weakened use looks as if it has come to stay,” and the fourth edition, published in 2015, refers darkly to “vague, watered down newer meanings” of irony.</p><p>The 2015 edition of The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage states that “the looser use of <em>irony</em> and <em>ironically</em>, to mean an incongruous turn of events, is trite. Not every coincidence, curiosity, oddity and paradox is an irony, even loosely.” It is interesting to note that in the 1999 edition there followed another sentence that has been omitted from the current edition: “And where irony does exist, sophisticated writing counts on the reader to recognize it.” Perhaps the editors of the guide realized they were fighting a losing battle on that point?</p><figure><blockquote><p>Equating irony with coincidence is still viewed — at least in some quarters — as a semantic transgression, although attitudes appear to be softening.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Other disapproving voices have weighed in on this issue. The American Heritage Dictionary provides a usage note for “ironic” that addresses this distinction: “Sometimes, people misapply <em>ironic</em>, <em>irony</em>, and <em>ironically</em> to events and circumstances that might better be described as simply <em>coincidental</em> or <em>improbable</em>, with no particular lessons about human vanity or presumption. Resistance to such uses remain strong.” The usage note is buttressed with data from the dictionary’s usage panel, a group of nearly two hundred journalists, creative writers, and scholars who complete annual surveys on the “acceptability” of word senses and grammatical constructions. The panel has been asked repeatedly to weigh in on the acceptability of a sentence that describes a woman from Ithaca, New York, who moves to California, where she meets and marries a man who is also from upstate New York. The sentence uses the word “ironically” to describe this outcome. In 1978, 78 percent of the panel rejected this usage. A survey from 2016 that contained the same sentence was deemed problematic by 63 percent of the panel, a figure that is lower than the earlier one but still a majority. Clearly, equating irony with coincidence is still viewed — at least in some quarters — as a semantic transgression, although attitudes appear to be softening. However, the shift may also have to do with the changing composition of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/books/23word.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Heritage’s usage panel</a> over time.</p><p>To explore this debate more fully, let’s consider a larger question: what exactly <em>is</em> a coincidence, anyway? As might be expected, different dictionaries take different approaches, but Merriam-Webster defines it as “the occurrence of events that happen at the same time by accident but seem to have some connection.” Needless to say, this formulation leaves plenty of room for interpretation, since a perception of “some connection” is inherently subjective.</p><p>A good example of this subjectivity can be found in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Droppings-George-Carlin/dp/0786883219" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brain Droppings</a>,” by the comedian George Carlin. He argues that the concept of irony has to do with opposites and has “nothing to do with coincidence.” He provides a number of examples to make his point, including the following: “A diabetic, on his way to buy insulin, is killed by a runaway truck. He is the victim of an accident. If the truck was delivering sugar, he is the victim of an oddly poetic coincidence. But if the truck was delivering insulin, ah! Then he is the victim of an irony.” At first blush, Carlin’s argument appears persuasive: A diabetic being hit by a truck delivering insulin does seem more ironic than a truck delivering sugar. It’s likely, however, that many people would characterize the “diabetic–sugar truck” juxtaposition as ironic as well: There clearly exists “some connection” between diabetes and sugar that seems to elevate such a pairing past mere coincidence.</p><p>Other examples, however, appear to be more straightforward. In “The Gift of the Magi” (1905), O. Henry tells the story of Jim and Della, a young couple seeking the perfect Christmas presents for each other (spoiler alert!). Both of them sacrifice prized possessions to be able to afford their gifts. Della has her lustrous tresses shorn so that she can afford a platinum pocket watch fob for Jim. Jim sells his pocket watch to buy ornamental combs for Della. Their actions thus destroy the value of the gifts that they exchange. The story is best described in terms of situational irony, with a dash of dramatic irony as well, since the reader is aware of the poignant outcome before Jim and Della meet to celebrate Christmas. It would be strange to describe the story’s outcome as merely a coincidence; this would seem to undercut the peculiarly symmetrical results of Jim and Della’s sacrifices. But does “The Gift of the Magi” rise to the level of providing “lessons about human vanity or presumption,” as dictated by the American Heritage definition? Perhaps, although it’s difficult to imagine widespread agreement on the necessary and sufficient criteria for vanity and presumption.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It is worth asking oneself, before describing such occurrences, whether a juxtaposition is mundane (that is, coincidental) or more surprising, consequential, or significant — and therefore ironic.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Both situational irony and coincidence are used to refer to states of affairs that may be difficult to classify as clearly belonging to one concept or the other. And attempts to cleanly differentiate between them may be a fool’s errand. The most we can say is that some people care about the distinction a great deal, and it is worth asking oneself, before describing such occurrences, whether a juxtaposition is mundane (that is, coincidental) or more surprising, consequential, or significant — and therefore ironic.</p><h3><strong>Paradox</strong></h3><p>As with coincidence, irony is often conflated with the concept of paradox. Once again, the two concepts overlap to a certain degree, since both irony and paradox can involve juxtaposition, sometimes jarring incongruity, and deviation from expectations. Paradox, however, goes a step further and entails self-contradiction as an essential element.</p><p>Paradox, like irony, has a long tradition in Western thought, but principally in the realm of logic as opposed to rhetoric. In her <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/paradox" target="_blank">book on paradox</a>, the philosopher Margaret Cuonzo notes three principal uses of the term. The definition most relevant for our purposes is “an argument with seemingly true premises, seemingly good reasoning, and an obviously false or contradictory conclusion.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>Paradox, like irony, has a long tradition in Western thought, but principally in the realm of logic as opposed to rhetoric.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The crucial issue that separates verbal irony from paradox is that the apparent contradiction can, in fact, be resolved. If someone mutters, “What lovely weather we’re having!” as they crouch in a tornado shelter, the statement would appear to stand in stark contrast to the true state of affairs. However, as we saw in the previous chapter, conversational participants implicitly assume that a cooperative principle is always in effect. This seemingly absurd remark, therefore, must make sense in some way. The contradiction leads the listener to make a context-specific inference — an implicature — that can resolve the apparent inconsistency. Someone who hears such a remark can draw on cultural expectations regarding the weather and conclude that the speaker intends some related proposition, such as its exact opposite. So what appears to be a contradiction can be bridged with a little world knowledge.</p><p>As with coincidence, the shared family resemblance between paradox and irony is low. Once again, we see the common element of incongruity, but little else. That is not to say that philosophers and literary critics haven’t muddied the waters with regard to paradox and irony. Friedrich Schlegel, the German poet, philosopher, and literary critic, declared that “irony is the form of paradox. Paradox is what is good and great at the same time.” The meaning of this fragmentary idea, however, is obscure. Cleanth Brooks, the scholar who helped establish the New Criticism movement, wrote in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Well-Wrought-Urn-Studies-Structure/dp/0156957051" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Well Wrought Urn</a>” that “the language of poetry is the language of paradox.” Brooks meant that the underlying meaning of a poem can be contradictory to its surface form, although he did not use the term “irony” to refer to this contradiction. Finally, Norman Knox proposed a category of paradoxical irony in which “everything is relative. … Author and audience fuse, or oscillate between identification and detachment.” However, this seems to be more of a restatement of romantic irony than a new use of the term.</p><div><figure><a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/what-nihilism-is-not/"></a><figcaption><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/what-nihilism-is-not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Nihilism Is Not</a>: In order to preserve nihilism as a meaningful concept, it’s necessary to distinguish it from pessimism, cynicism, and apathy.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To the degree that nonscholars use the term “paradoxical irony,” it seems to function as a mere intensifier for the concept of irony or coincidence. The phrase is not common: It appears only twice in a 14-billion-word sample of 22 million web pages provided in a searchable corpus known as iWeb. The first appears in a review of Sheryl Crow’s album “Be Myself”:</p><p>It seems the title is a reminder, but there’s paradoxical irony in having to remind yourself to be yourself.</p><p>The second case also occurs in the context of a review, in this case the book “Jacques Derrida’s Aporetic Ethics”:</p><p>The paradoxical irony began with Socrates being the wisest man in Athens because he alone knew he could know nothing.</p><p>One could argue that, in both instances, the word “paradoxical” is doing little of the heavy lifting. And neither example suggests the element of self-contradiction that paradoxes typically involve. As in many instances of situational irony, the phrase “paradoxical irony” could be replaced with “it seems strange that” or “it’s odd that” with no loss of meaning.</p><h3><strong>Satire</strong></h3><p>Satire works best when it hews close to the line between the outlandish and the possible — and as that line continues to grow thinner, the satirist’s task becomes ever more difficult.</p><p>Satire may feel like a relatively new and subversive form of humor, but in reality it has existed for millennia. It appears as early as the fifth century BCE in the Old Comedy of ancient Greece and the plays of Aristophanes. It was fully developed as a genre by Roman authors such as Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal. The goal of satire — social criticism by shaming the powerful, the foolish, or the corrupt — can make even ancient examples of the form seem startlingly contemporary.</p><p>To appreciate a particular work as satiric, an audience must keep in mind two distinct mental representations simultaneously: the literal meaning of a message and an awareness of a discrepancy between that message and the intention of its author. Richard Roberts and I have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327868ms0802_2?journalCode=hmet19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that this duality gives satire its distinctive character and accounts for satire’s effectiveness as a vehicle for social commentary. The audience has to construct the author’s intentions for themselves by recognizing and accounting for this apparent discrepancy. In this way, satire may represent the ultimate form of the admonition “show, don’t tell.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The goal of satire — social criticism by shaming the powerful, the foolish, or the corrupt — can make even ancient examples of the form seem startlingly contemporary.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The satirist has many weapons at her disposal, including parody, a form that I discuss separately. She may also employ outlandish exaggeration, blatant falsehoods, and sly innuendo. And virtually all satirists use verbal irony and sarcasm extensively, since these devices are especially well suited to the twin goals of being humorous and critical at the same time.</p><p>An important component of irony is pretense, and it is essential for satire as well. The audience of the satirist needs to recognize the pretense of its creator, or else the satire fails as such. When Jonathan Swift made his “modest proposal” that the poor sell their children as food for the rich, it was so extreme that hardly anyone could have perceived it as a serious suggestion. But satire can be much subtler, and in such cases the pretense becomes less clear. For some, it may become invisible.</p><p>A prime example can be seen in “The Colbert Report,” in which Stephen Colbert played the role of a bloviating conservative pundit, rarely breaking character. Progressive audiences enjoyed his outlandish claims and proposals as a sophisticated rebuke of perceived excesses by pundits of the far right. However, some conservatives also enjoyed the program and believed that Colbert genuinely meant what he was saying. For those viewers, there was no recognition of Colbert’s pretense. A study conducted by Heather LaMarre and her collaborators <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1940161208330904" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">showed</a> that a viewer’s political ideology predicted whether or not he or she perceived the program as satiric. Both liberals and conservatives thought that Colbert was funny, but only politically liberal members of his audience were in on the joke.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Both liberals and conservatives thought that Colbert was funny, but only politically liberal members of his audience were in on the joke.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Another essential ingredient of both verbal irony and satire is the existence of common ground. Common ground involves a presupposition of knowledge that two parties share. To understand a work as satiric, audience members use this shared knowledge to recognize that something is not quite right. Common ground can be ephemeral, and if enough time has elapsed, a work of satire may no longer even be recognized as such.</p><p>A potential example of this phenomenon is the “Historia Augusta,” which has been the subject of scholarly debate for many years. This Latin manuscript, which purports to be the work of six authors writing in the third century, consists of 30 biographies of Roman emperors, their corulers, and usurpers who reigned from 117 to 285 CE. It also contains nearly 150 extracts from letters, speeches, and Senate proceedings such as decrees and proclamations. It would seem to be a document of considerable historical value, and scholars like Edward Gibbon drew on it when writing their own histories. Over time, however, researchers have found that the manuscript contains a host of inaccuracies and outright falsehoods. As a historical chronicle, there is something seriously wrong with it. This has led to considerable debate about who composed it, when it was written, and, most important, why it was compiled in the first place.</p><p>Scholars today believe that the “Historia Augusta” is the work of a single author. It was probably written several decades after its purported date of composition, given the numerous anachronisms that do not fit with the time period being described. Most, if not all, of the letters, speeches, and Senate extracts are thought to have been fabricated. And as a history of the period, it is peculiar, to say the least. Scholars Justin Stover and Mike Kestemont <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2041-5370.2016.12043.x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">note</a> that the manuscript contains “bizarre details and puzzling omissions, as well as [a] lurid focus on emperors’ peccadilloes and personal habits to the detriment of their political accomplishments.” In short, the “Historia Augusta” does not appear to be the factual account it claims to be.</p><p>Opinions about the purpose of the author have run the gamut from political propaganda to a pagan attack on Christianity. Some classicists, such as Ronald Syme, have emphasized its puns and wordplay, suggesting that the work was simply the musings of a “rogue grammarian.” Shawn Daniels, however, has made <a href="https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0045915/00001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a convincing case</a> for the “Historia Augusta” as a work of satire. The “Historia Augusta” may have been intended for a contemporary circle of readers who would have immediately recognized the exaggerations, gaps, and outright fabrications as clever social commentary. Because this audience shared common ground with the author, they were able to appreciate an intent now obscured by the passage of time. It is not hard to imagine archaeologists of the future stumbling across a cache of issues of the The Onion and scratching their heads over headlines like “Obama under Fire for Playing T-Ball during Vietnam.”</p><p>Finally, sharing common ground is essential for appreciating the <em>purpose</em> of satire. A satiric critique may be perceived as humorous by members of one community but as offensive or even blasphemous by members of another. The 2015 Al-Qaeda attack on the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo is a tragic example of what can happen when satire is perceived as sacrilege.</p><p>Recognizing pretense and sharing common ground are essential for understanding both verbal irony and satire. As a result, the two terms are sometimes used synonymously. But not all irony is satiric, and not all satire employs irony. To complicate matters further, satire is often confused with parody, our next topic.</p><h3><strong>Parody</strong></h3><p>Satire is a lesson, parody is a game.</p><p>As we have seen, pretense is an essential component of many forms of irony, and this holds true for parody as well. At its heart, a parody is an intentional imitation of something else, although the goals of the parodist vary. At one extreme, the intent may be to gently poke fun at the original work or its creator. At the other extreme, however, it may involve full-throated condemnation. The more aggressive forms of parody liberally use exaggeration, satire, and sarcasm to ridicule the authentic work and, by extension, the person who produced it. The overlap of these figurative forms and genres can lead to confusion and cause them to be mistaken for one another.</p><p>As a literary genre, parody, like satire, dates back to the Old Comedy of ancient Greece. Its first practitioner may have been Hegemon of Thasos, who lived during the fifth century BCE. The form has been popular in Western literature for several centuries. Examples run the gamut from parodies of chivalric romance (Chaucer’s Sir Thopas in “The Canterbury Tales”) and heroic narratives (Pope’s “Rape of the Lock”) to gothic novels (Austen’s “Northanger Abbey”). Parody is also commonly employed in the visual arts and music. And many radio programs, films, and television shows are parodic in nature. Comedy programs like “The Daily Show” and the “Weekend Update” segment of “Saturday Night Live” extensively use the conventions and trappings of network newscasts, such as news anchors’ desks, reports from correspondents “in the field,” and faux interviews. Sitcoms like “The Office” and “Modern Family” are classified as “mockumentaries”: parodies of documentaries.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A parody succeeds as a parody only if the audience is able to recognize the original work being lampooned.</p></blockquote></figure><p>As with satire, the consumer of a parody must maintain two distinct mental representations at once. In this case, however, these are the literal meaning of the work and an awareness of what is being imitated. A parody succeeds as a parody only if the audience is able to recognize the original work being lampooned. Many cartoons on television employ parody, but the imitation is often lost on children because they have not yet encountered the original. Later, as parents, they may watch the same cartoons with their kids and discover a whole new layer of meaning: the clever imitation that went over their heads the first time around during their own childhoods.</p><p>Ironists and parodists share the same occupational hazard: the danger of being taken literally. Those who choose to criticize public figures, however, have legal precedent on their side. In a 1988 Supreme Court ruling (<em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell</em>), the televangelist sued the publication after being depicted as an incestuous drunkard in a parody of a liquor ad. The Court unanimously overturned a lower court’s verdict and ruled in favor of Hustler. No reasonable person, the Court declared, would have interpreted the magazine’s depiction of Falwell as factual. Therefore satires and parodies of public figures do not entitle such individuals to damages for emotional distress.</p><p>Parodists who choose to imitate well-known artistic works, on the other hand, have to contend with thin-skinned and litigious authors and musicians who may take umbrage at having their creations exploited in this way. In their defense, parodists can invoke the principles of artistic expression and fair use. However, the original creator can claim that the parody infringes on a copyright or trademark. One such case, <em>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc.</em>, was argued before the Supreme Court in 1994. At issue was 2 Live Crew’s 1989 song “Pretty Woman,” which was alleged to have “substantial similarities” to “Oh, Pretty Woman,” released by Roy Orbison and William Deese in 1964. In that case, the Court ruled that the parody fell within the scope of fair use. Despite this protection, some parodists, such as “Weird Al” Yankovic, always seek permission from the original artists before lampooning their work.</p><p>A caricature can function as a satire or a parody, but it is perhaps best thought of as a separate entity. The essence of caricature is exaggeration, typically for humorous effect. Political cartoonists, for example, will overemphasize specific features of their victims, such as Richard Nixon’s nose, Jimmy Carter’s teeth, Barack Obama’s ears, or Donald Trump’s coiffure. However, if the caricature is based on a prior representation that is well known, as in the case of Shepard Fairey’s “Hope” poster, then an exaggerated drawing of Obama could be described as both a caricature and a parody.</p><p>The lack of shared context in online communities makes users less likely to recognize nonliteral language as such. Online works of satire, in particular those involving heavy irony, may be mistaken for genuinely held beliefs or attitudes. This problem was recognized in the 1980s, even before the emergence of the web, by users posting to newsgroups on Usenet. In 1983, Jerry Schwarz observed that “a sideways smile, : – ) … has become widely accepted on the net as an indication that ‘I’m only kidding’. If you submit a satiric item without this symbol, no matter how obvious the satire is to you, do not be surprised if people take it seriously.”</p><p>Parody can also be difficult to express online, since it requires an audience to recognize that some prior work is being imitated. This phenomenon was given a name by Nathan Poe, who <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Internet-Critical-Thinking-Digital/dp/1978505698" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lamented</a> that “without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that <em>someone</em> won’t mistake for the genuine article.” His observation, now referred to as <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/06/poes-law-troll-cultures-central-rule/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Poe’s Law</a>, refers more generally to any controversial topic that is debated online.</p><p>Neither satire nor parody requires irony to accomplish its particular ends, however. Parody, in particular, can be highly effective when it closely resembles the original. And in some cases, the goal may not be mockery at all. It may simply be a tribute from one artist to another, as when a musician covers another artist’s song. The lines that separate homage, parody, and outright plagiarism are murky at best.</p><hr/><p><em><strong>Roger Kreuz</strong> is Associate Dean and Director of Graduate Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Psychology at the University of Memphis.

                <p>
                  You can use it like any other domain, however a .forever domain will NEVER expire.  Unlike other domains, you completely control your .forever domain and no one can ever take it from you or censor your access to the domain.  You can register [your family name].forever and pass it down from generation to generation.  
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

                <p>
                   .forever is a top-level domain in the <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a> root zone, so you will need a Handshake resolver in order to view .forever domains.  We created <a href="https://impervious.com/fingertip.html">Fingertip</a>, an easy to use menubar app to simplify this. It uses <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/HIPs/blob/master/HIP-0005.md">HIP-5</a> to delegate subdomain management to our fork of ENS.
                </p>

            </div>

              <div id="collapseFour" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour" aria-expanded="true">
                <p>
                  To make this easy, we&#39;ve created <a href="https://impervious.com/fingertip.html">Fingertip</a>, an open source menu bar app that uses <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd">hnsd</a> (an SPV resolver daemon for the Handshake network) + Ethereum to resolve .forever domains.

                <p>
                  An advantage of Handshake is that it doesn&#39;t require trusting Certificate Authorities (CAs) for SSL.  HTTPS is done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DANE</a>, a DNS-based authentication, which requires no trust or centralized control over SSL certificates.  It is more secure than https on traditional domains because you don&#39;t have to trust CAs.

                <p>
                  The management of .forever domains is done with a fork of ENS which includes an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1185.md">EIP-1185</a>, which allows DNS on ENS.  Our contracts have been verified on etherscan and you can <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x24bf911ebF9cc5Ce5d65041b9343D7c5F9565509#code">view them here</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/imperviousinc/forever-contracts">on github</a>.

                <p>
                  Of course!  Since .forever uses DNS, you can set up a .well-known directory on your domains, using <a href="https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0002/">HIP-2</a>, to publish a wallet address for your domain.  An advantage of this in comparison to .eth or .crypto is that you can dynamically create a new address for each request without paying gas fees.  Hooray!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Nope!  We do have an ENS reverse registrar deployed, which helps to map the .forever domains you own to your Ethereum wallet address.  This is so that you can easily see and manage the domains you own from the <a href="https://app.foreverdomains.io">app.foreverdomains.io</a> website, or other apps and integrations.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div id="collapseNine" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingNine" aria-expanded="true">
                <p>
                  Yes, every .forever domain is issued as an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC-721</a> token. Building on this standard makes it easier for developers to integrate with .forever domains and it lets users manage their domain ownership from any compatible wallet, exchange, or marketplace.

BioNTech will assess multiple vaccine candidates featuring known Malaria targets such as the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), as well as new antigens discovered in the pre-clinical research phase. The most promising mRNA vaccine candidates will be selected for clinical development. The start of the clinical trial for the first vaccine candidate is planned for the end of 2022. The Malaria vaccine development program is an extension of BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine efforts. Building on two decades of mRNA research and its clinical stage mRNA platform, BioNTech has co-developed the first mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine together with its partner Pfizer.</p>  <p>The second objective is the development of sustainable vaccine production and supply solutions on the African continent. BioNTech is exploring possibilities to set up state-of-the-art mRNA manufacturing facilities, either with partners or on its own. The facilities are expected to manufacture various mRNA-based vaccines upon approval to ensure sustainable supply operations. BioNTech plans to co-locate its African manufacturing capabilities with the technology transfer hubs under development by the WHO, in alignment with the African manufacturing strategy created by the Africa CDC. This strategy aims to expand the capacity of low- and middle-income countries to manufacture contemporary vaccines end-to-end, and scale up production to increase global access.</p>  <p>“The response to the pandemic has shown that science and innovation can transform people&#39;s lives when all key stakeholders work together towards a common goal. We are committed to bringing our innovations to those who need them most,” said <strong>Prof. Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech</strong>. “We are more than grateful to be part of the joint efforts of the Eradicate Malaria project. Together with our partners, we will do whatever it takes to develop a safe and effective mRNA-based Malaria vaccine that will prevent the disease, reduce mortality and ensure a sustainable solution for the African continent and other regions affected by this disease. Our efforts will include cutting-edge research and innovation, significant investments in vaccine development, the establishment of manufacturing facilities, and the transfer of manufacturing expertise to production sites on the African continent and wherever else it is needed.”</p>  <p>BioNTech has undertaken comprehensive antigen discovery processes to identify antigens for various vaccine candidates. Since 2019, the Company has collaborated with the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to develop Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Tuberculosis programs and provide affordable access to vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. For Tuberculosis, BioNTech plans to begin clinical trials for testing a vaccine candidate in 2022, just about two years after the program was initiated. The antigen discovery processes for Malaria and Tuberculosis are being conducted by specialized teams at BioNTech’s headquarters in Mainz. Currently, BioNTech and its partners are developing vaccines against nine different infectious diseases, and the Company continues to develop 15 oncology programs at clinical stage based on four different drug classes, including mRNA.</p>  <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), European Commission and other organizations have been involved in the early planning phase of BioNTech’s Malaria project and have offered their support to identify and set up the necessary infrastructure. Collaboration with the African Union and the Africa CDC under the partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing programme will ensure that the enabling factors such as regulatory alignment and policy transfer, as well as country coordination are in place to get the vaccines from factories to the citizens of the African Union.</p>  <p>BioNTech’s Malaria project is part of the ‘eradicateMalaria’ initiative, led by the kENUP Foundation, to accelerate the eradication of Malaria. The kENUP Foundation is a non-profit public benefit foundation supporting research-based innovation in the wider health industries for societal benefit.</p>  <p><strong>About Malaria</strong> <em>(source WHO)</em> </p>  <p><strong>About Tuberculosis</strong><em> (source WHO) </em></p>  <p><strong>About BioNTech</strong></p>  <p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>  <p>For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see BioNTech’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

<p>Earlier this year, I published a post showing our results of the <a href="https://destevez.net/2021/03/interferometric-imaging-with-allen-telescope-array/" data-type="post" data-id="9784">interferometric imaging of Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A at 4.9 GHz with the Allen Telescope Array</a>. Near the end of July, I decided to perform more interferometric observations of Cygnus A at a higher frequency, in order to obtain better resolution. I chose a frequency of 8.45 GHz because it is usually a band clean of interference (since it is allocated to deep space communications), it is used by other radio observatories, so flux densities can be compared directly with previous results, and because going higher up in frequency the sensitivity of the old feeds at ATA starts to decrease.</p>



<p>This post is a summary of the observations and results. The code and data is included at the end of the post.</p>



<h4>Observation set up</h4>



<p>For these observations, I used 6 antennas that have recently entered into service. The configuration of the USRPs is the same as I described in my <a href="https://destevez.net/2021/03/interferometric-imaging-with-allen-telescope-array/" data-type="post" data-id="9784">post from March</a>, so only one baseline can be correlated at a time and the set of baselines that can be formed is limited to those obtained by choosing one of the antennas available for USRP1 and one of the antennas available for USRP2, as follows:</p>



<ul><li>USRP1: 2c, 2e, 3l, 5b</li><li>USRP2: 2j, 2m</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, only 8 baselines can be formed with these 6 antennas.</p>



<p>The sources observed in these observations are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>3C286 as polarization calibrator, flux density scale calibrator, and backup phase calibrator</li><li>J2007+404 as primary phase calibrator; this is a 2.85 Jy source <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/observing/callist">listed as a VLA calibrator</a></li><li>3C84 as bandpass calibrator and backup phase calibrator</li><li>Cygnus A as science target</li></ul>



<p>Cygnus A is located at only 1.59 degrees separation from the calibrator J2007+404. The image below, taken from the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/">VLASS</a> 2-4 GHz VLA sky survey shows both of them. Cygnus A is inside the black box, since VLASS excludes very strong sources, and J2007+404 can be seen towards the left of Cygnus A, showing large sidelobes in this <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/vlass/data-access/vlass-epoch-1-quick-look-users-guide">quicklook image</a> due to its rather high flux density (compared with the sensitivity of this survey). This image has been obtained with the web interface to the <a href="http://archive-new.nrao.edu/vlass/HiPS/VLASS2.1/Quicklook/">VLASS2.1 HiPS data</a>, which allows us to explore the radio sky easily.</p>

<p>I used the same GNU Radio software correlator as back in March. This is contained in the <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_interferometry/">ata_interferometry</a> Github repository. The observed bandwidth was 40.96 MHz, using the X and Y polarizations. All the polarimetric autocorrelations and cross-correlations were computed in real time, and phased in post-processing and reduced to UVFITS files with 64 frequency channels and 1 second integration time.</p>



<h4>Observation scheduling</h4>



<p>The observations were carried out during three consecutive days: 23, 24 an 25 July. The first day was a full track observation of 3C286 only. The goal of this observation was to gather as much data as possible for polarization calibration, and additionally to serve as a check of the system.</p>



<p>The second day, the observation of all the targets was carried out, following this order:</p>



<ul><li>3C286 was observed as soon as it rose, and until Cygnus A rose</li><li>When Cygnus A and J2007+404 rose, they were scanned alternatively, with infrequent scans of 3C286</li><li>When 3C84 rose, the pattern of scanning Cygnus A and J2007+404 continued, but the infrequent scans of 3C286 were replaced by infrequent scans of 3C84</li><li>When Cygnus A and J2007+404 set, 3C84 was observed for an hour more, with the goal of using this final segment for bandpass calibration</li></ul>



<p>Unfortunately, there was a problem with the observation script throughout the night, before Cygnus A rose, so several hours of data were lost. The third day the same schedule was followed, with the observation script already corrected, so all the data was gathered.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the calibrated visibility amplitudes of the whole three days. Colouring is by field, with 3C286 in black, J2007+404 in pink, Cygnus A in orange, and 3C84 in green.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amplitudes.png"></a><figcaption>Calibrated visibility amplitudes coloured by field</figcaption></figure>



<p>The plot shows the great differences in brightness of the sources, with Cygnus A being by far the brightest. It is often not easy to get calibrators close to the science target that have a flux density of at least a few Jy, which is necessary for good results with the ATA 6.1 m dishes observing with only 40 MHz of bandwidth and one baseline at a time. Therefore, the presence of J2007+404 so close to Cygnus A is a happy coincidence.</p>



<p>3C84 is by far one of the strongest compact calibrators, so it is quite useful for bandpass calibration and other calibrations that benefit from high SNR.</p>



<h4>Calibration</h4>



<p>Calibration and imaging was performed in <a href="https://casa.nrao.edu/">CASA</a> 6.2.0. First, some flagging of interference was done with <code>tfcrop</code>. Then data that was visibly bad when examining the amplitudes or phases with <code>msview</code> was manually flagged.</p>



<p>Two separated bandpass calibrations were performed using the scans of 3C84 at the end of the second and third day, after Cygnus A had set. The calibration from the second day turned out to be much better because there was some unknown problem during the third day that caused a loss in sensitivity. The amplitude of the cross-correlations decreased suddenly, while the amplitude of the autocorrelations wasn’t affected. Moreover, the variance of the visibilities increased significantly. Therefore, the bandpass solution from the second day was chosen to be applied to all the data.</p>



<p>The figures below show the bandpass solutions. As I remarked in my post from March, it is not possible to use CASA for a delay calibration because of the baseline-by-baseline scans. Therefore, the delays, which are small, are absorbed by the bandpass phase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bandpass_amplitude.png"></a><figcaption>Bandpass amplitude solution (both polarizations)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is interesting that the reference antenna, 2j, has a noticeable delay difference in the X and Y polarizations, whereas the rest of the antennas have more similar delays.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bandpass_phase_Poln0.png"></a><figcaption>Bandpass phase solution (X polarization)</figcaption></figure>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bandpass_phase_Poln1.png"></a><figcaption>Bandpass phase solution (Y polarization)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides calibrating the bandpass, these scans of 3C84 are used to perform a time-independent phase calibration, which is then used as the phase offset between the X and Y polarizations. This allows all further phase calibrations to be performed in a polarization-independent way, which increases the SNR.</p>



<p>Next, a polarization-independent phase calibration is done on each compact calibrator. The solution intervals are chosen manually during most of the observations in order to fit well with the 8 baseline cycle.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the results of applying this phase calibration, together with the bandpass and X-Y phase offset to the three compact sources 3C286 (black), J2007+404 (pink) and 3C84 (green). The decrease in sensitivity at some point during the third day is apparent in the noise in the phase of J2007+404.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/calibrators_phase.png"></a><figcaption>Calibrated phase for compact sources</figcaption></figure>



<p>After phase calibration, amplitude calibration is done. This is carried out in a polarization-dependent way, since the gains of the two channels can change independently. The idea is to use 3C286 as the flux density calibrator and to transfer the flux scale to the other calibrators. However, there are the following two quirks to handle.</p>



<p>On the second day there is a long gap without data, separating 3C286 and the other sources. This means that the amplitude scale from 3C286 can’t be transferred to the other sources, since the gains can have changed somewhat during that gap (and in fact the correct amplitude transfer shows that it has changed). Therefore, what we do for this day is to use 3C84 as the amplitude scale, forcing the flux measured on the third day during calibration.</p>



<p>On the third day we have the problem with the change in sensitivity, that causes a sudden decrease of visibility amplitudes. The segments before and after the change are calibrated and transferred separately, and this seems to work well.</p>



<p>The figures below show the calibrated amplitudes of each of the calibrators. There is perhaps a slight difference in amplitude for 3C84 comparing the second and third days. This is caused by the peculiar calibration process explained above, but it is something minor.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/calibrators_amplitude_Field3C84.png"></a><figcaption>Calibrated amplitudes for 3C84</figcaption></figure>



<p>For each of these sources, the bandpass and X-Y phase offset from 3C84 on the second day and the amplitude and phase calibration from itself are used. For Cygnus A, the bandpass and X-Y phase offset are also taken from 3C84 and the amplitude and phase calibration is taken from J2007+404.</p>



<h4>Imaging</h4>



<p>Imaging is done using multi-scale cleaning and roughly the same parameters as in my post from March. A pixel size of 4 arcseconds is used. In contrast to that post, an image size of 512×512 pixels is used to image the whole primary beam, though we don’t expect to see any other objects away from the phase centre in each field.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the UV coverage for Cygnus A. There is coverage between approximately 0.2kλ to 7λ, which corresponds to resolutions between 30 arcsec and 17 arcmin.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cyga_uv.png"></a><figcaption>UV coverage for Cygnus A</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next figure shows the amplitude versus modulus of (U,V). We can see that several baselines are probing the first nulls of the visibility of Cygnus A. In some of the  baselines we see that the line is double. There are somewhat different gain calibrations on each of the two days. This will be fixed with self-calibration after imaging.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cyga_uvwave_amp.png"></a><figcaption>Amplitude versus |(U,V)| for Cygnus A</figcaption></figure>



<p>For the compact sources, first an image is done without many clean iterations to generate a model, then phase and amplitude self-calibration is made, and a second image is cleaned with more iterations. The images are not very interesting, since the sources are unresolved, but imaging is a good way to check that everything is working correctly.</p>



<p>For Cygnus A, first an image is cleaned, then a phase self-calibration is done, a new clean image is done, and finally a phase and amplitude self-calibration is done with the new image, thus producing a final self-calibrated image.</p>



<p>The SNR for each of the images is shown below. This is computed as the quotient of the maximum pixel brightness and the RMS in an area that does not contain the object. We can see how the SNRs of 3C84 and Cygnus A increase greatly after self-calibration. Since these objects are very bright, the image SNR is mainly limited by calibration errors.</p>



<pre>3C84.image SNR: 163.43
3C84_selfcal1.image SNR: 406.75
3C286.image SNR: 409.76
3C286_selfcal1.image SNR: 474.12
J2007+404.image SNR: 182.80
J2007+404_selfcal1.image SNR: 189.06
CygA.image SNR: 168.43
CygA_selfcal1.image SNR: 230.08
CygA_selfcal2.image SNR: 539.46</pre>



<p>The images for the three calibrators are shown below.</p>

<p>The next figure shows the image for Cygnus A. We can clearly see the double source structure.</p>

<p>A zoom to this image and the addition of a contour plot reveal more detail. The contours are set at 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90% levels.</p>

<p>In the central part between the two lobes there is a flux of around 3 Jy/beam. This is significantly higher than the noise floor, which is a fraction of a Jy/beam. It provides evidence that we are detecting the small central component, that corresponds to the supermassive black hole in the active galaxy. The figure below, taken from <a href="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~ccarilli/cyga.shtml">this page</a>, shows an image done with VLA at 5 GHz that has 60 times more resolution and shows the central component clearly.</p>

<p>The total flux density in the image of Cygnus A is 201.6 Jy,  and the maximum brightness is 79.7 Jy/beam.</p>



<h4>Polarimetry</h4>



<p>I hoped to use these observations to study the polarization of Cygnus A. This is the reason why the first day was devoted to a full track observation of 3C286. However, I have not been able to obtain a satisfactory polarization calibration. It is difficult to detect the polarized signature in the cross-hands due to the large leakages and low SNR. Moreover, the changes in the relative amplitudes of the parallel-hands do not seem so consistent between different baselines, for some unknown reason.</p>



<p>I have even been following the <a href="https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=3C286_Polarization">CASA tutorial for polarimetric imaging of 3C286 with ALMA</a> (since ALMA also uses a linear polarization basis, unlike the VLA), trying to improve my techniques. However, after trying to do something with the data for a while, I think that it is not good enough, and better data needs to be gathered.</p>



<h4>Code and data</h4>



<p>The code used in this post for correlation and phasing is the usual GNU Radio FX software correlator pipeline from the <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_interferometry/">ata_interferometry</a> repository. The calibration and imaging in CASA was done with <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/ata_interferometry/blob/main/CASA/CygA_2020724.py">this script</a>.</p>



<p>The data has been published as the dataset “<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5170601#.YRAS2pLtaCg">Cygnus A 8.45 GHz interferometric observation with Allen Telescope Array</a>” in <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Forty years ago, on 10 August, a tall and wiry old man died at Kensington Palace, aged 94. He had been a cultivated chap — a former Director of the Midland Bank, Secretary of the Literary Society and Director of the Royal Academy of Music. He read Shakespeare on the Tube as he travelled to meetings at the bank, and wrote amateur poetry. Occasionally royalty stopped to chit chat on their way past, as Princess Margaret once did with her new baby. In later retirement, he had become something of a hermit, looking like “a pot-bellied old beaver”, to use his own words, and growing an ungainly beard.</p>
<p>This man was Alan “Tommy” Lascelles, former Private Secretary to George VI and Queen Elizabeth II, and the Assistant Private Secretary to Edward VIII when he was Prince of Wales. He had lived, grace-and-favour, at the Old Stables at Kensington Palace (he thought it was one of the nicest houses in England) since he retired in 1953. Having been a courtier, on and off, from 1920-1953, he gives a fascinating insight into how to preserve a monarchy in a democracy.</p>

<p>Lascelles gets caricatured as a stiff-arsed, hard-bristled, curmudgeonly enforcer of horrible rules in <em>The Crown</em><em>, </em>forever thwarting true love’s course. As well as playing a role in Edward VIII’s abdication, Lascelles is seen as one of the Establishment men who decided Princess Margaret couldn’t marry Peter Townsend. But despite this crucial role in modern Royal history, the real Lascelles remains slightly out of sight to us. There is no biography. His archives in Churchill College, Cambridge are largely closed — especially material relating to the monarchy. Edward Owens, who recently wrote a book about the royal family and the mass media, was denied access to them. His diaries, although excellent, were selectively edited by his friend Rupert Hart-Davis; they reveal a much more emotional, sensible, likeable man than the popular image.</p>
<p>There is no consensus, then, on Lascelles’s true character. To Edward VIII, living in exile as the Duke of Windsor, Lascelles was always “that snake”. The feeling was mutual. When Harold Nicolson had lunch with Lascelles three days after the Abdication, the courtier said the former King was “like a child in the fairy stories who had been given every gift except a soul”. He was also spitting with rage about the fact that Edward VIII was not patriotic enough: “He never cared about England or the English.” Ferdinand Mount <a href="https://www-lrb-co-uk.lonlib.idm.oclc.org/the-paper/v40/n01/ferdinand-mount/always-the-same-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remembers</a> Lascelles visiting his school, where Mount “was startled by his explosion of venom against the Duke of Windsor … He was memorably unpleasant.”</p>

<p>But Lascelles wasn’t just a stickler for arcane and snobbish standards, nor did he take a cruel pleasure in enforcing them. He stood for fair play and pragmatism. When Noël Coward was recommended for a knighthood, Lascelles advised George VI against. The King was constantly approving court martials against young RAF officers who had written dud cheques, and Coward had recently been fined for cheating his Income Tax. It would have been wrong for those young men to be punished while Coward was honoured.</p>
<p>Essentially honourable, then, despite being memorably unpleasant. Lascelles understood that although monarchy must be staged, that doesn’t mean it can be fake. The public spectacle has to be a true enough expression of the values it upholds. That is why the knighthood had to be refused, and why Wallace Simpson couldn’t be Queen. (In one of his more venomous moments, Lascelles wrote that the King’s subjects would not tolerate “a shop-spoiled American, with two living husbands and a voice like a rusty saw”.) That is why, after the abdication, Lascelles went to some lengths to keep Edward out of the country, to try and eradicate the whole affair from the public mind. It is also why, irrespective of the way it happened, Lascelles came to believe the abdication was inevitable. Edward, he said, was “habitually ready to sacrifice truth to his personal likes or dislikes”; Edward’s celebrity wasn’t enough to maintain the monarchy.</p>
<p>Lascelles believed in the institution but said, “I have never idealised any member of the House of Windsor”. When Harold Nicolson was commissioned to write George V’s biography, Lascelles told him it would be the biography of an institution, and that there would be no need to “descend into personalities”. This isn’t just bluster. The night the abdication was announced, Lascelles walked round and round St James’s Park, thinking about James II. The stability of the monarchy mattered to him. He described the abdication as “a real tragedy in my life”.</p>

<p>And yet for someone with such strong principles, Lascelles lacked a sense of direction. As a young graduate, he was rather louche. Although he was skittling around London dining with what Bertie Wooster would call some of the better elements, his diary never comes alive like it does when he shoots his first stag, or when he’s riding a horse. (He gives thanks that he inherited the “long, flat Lascelles thighs.”) His main interest as a young man — just like Edward VIII’s — was to be active. A series of possible careers — Foreign Office, stockbroker, journalist — were tried, hated, failed or simply never started. Without the war, he would have been edging towards becoming a drifter. Instead, despite a somewhat inactive war, he was awarded the Military Cross.</p>
<p>After the Armistice, he worked for his brother-in-law, the Governor of Bombay. Writing to his uncle <a href="https://commonreader.substack.com/p/what-kind-of-ordinary-the-sad-but" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adolphous Liddell</a> (another slightly lost soul) he said: “there is much in all the flummery and ceremonial which, even after a long course of military discipline, irritates me profoundly.” We might be surprised at this lack of admiration for imperial flummery. This is, after all, Alan Lascelles: reactionary, establishment stalwart, slayer of marriages, arch defender of the old order. But it was precisely this slightly detached view that made him such a good courtier.</p>
<p>Lascelles believed in the substance of royalty, not just the display. The day after George V died, nearly 20 years after that complaint about imperial flummery, the King’s body was taken to a little church at the end of the garden at Sandringham for a small private ceremony ahead of the large, public spectacle:</p>
<p><em>“The guardsmen, with scarcely a sound, slung the coffin on their shoulders and laid it before the altar; and there, after a very brief service, we left it, to be watched for thirty-six hours by the men of the Sandringham Estate. I daresay when all the tumult and shouting dies, that little ceremony will remain in my mind as the most impressive of all.”</em></p>
<p>Lascelles was not the sort of Royalist who was in it for the memorial plates and days out at the park. He was a genuine believer. He could talk of the King as a Deity with little exaggeration. He was burying the head of his tribe. This is why there was such a kerfuffle with the new King. Edward VIII wanted to run a very different sort of tribe.</p>

<p>Lascelles’s history with Edward VIII is essential to understanding later events. When he returned from India in 1920, his friend Letty Elcho brought him a letter offering a job with Edward VIII, then Prince of Wales. Lascelles was attracted to the job partly because St. James’s Palace was half a mile from his house and a quarter of a mile from his club, but mostly because “I have got a very deep admiration for the Prince, and I am convinced that the future of England is as much in his hands as in any individual”. Remarkably, had this job not come along, he would have signed on as an apprentice to a printing firm.</p>
<p>This deep admiration would not last, and Lascelles’s ability to see the ridiculous in the Royal was important to his role as a courtier. After nine years of watching the Prince drink, gamble, womanise, neglect his duties, be rude to members of the British establishment, and — shockingly for the feudal Alan — show very little interest when there was a scare that George V might die, he stormed out in 1929, in the sort of resignation so many of us have dreamed of making:</p>
<p><em>When he asked me why I wanted to leave him, I paced his room for the best part of an hour, telling him, as I might have told a younger brother, exactly what I thought of him and his whole scheme of life, and foretelling, with an accuracy that might have surprised me at the time, that he would lose the throne of England.</em></p>
<p>Most of us, after such an exit, would never go back. And Lascelles had only drifted into the role. Quitting it, he called himself “an inverted Falstaff” (because he was thin, just as thin in middle age as when he was young), leaving Prince Hal to “work out his own damnation”. But, after two years of reading and gardening with his family in the country, and a stint working for the Governor General in Canada, he was asked to re-join the Royal staff.</p>
<p>At first, he refused. The job was with George V, who he once described as “the godhead” — but Lascelles had said in his resignation letter: “Very few men can go on being private secretaries all their lives, and I am not one of them.” And besides, he pointed out, when the king died, he would be in a very difficult position, to put it mildly, having told the next-in-line exactly what he thought of him. Clive Wigram, George V’s Private Secretary — who was hiring Lascelles to be his assistant — told him not to worry. The King was in splendid health and had years left in him. Lascelles wrote to his wife Joan saying he was going to take the job: “It is no use going about the world singing ‘God Save the King’ if one isn’t prepared to assist the Deity when called upon.”</p>

<p>And so, in January 1936, he travelled to Norfolk to start his new job. He had found a first-class carriage reserved for him at Liverpool Street. Once the journey was underway, “a young man appeared in the doorway of my carriage. I was about to tell him to go away when I recognised him as the Duke of York.” It was a good thing he recognised him. The young man would accede as George VI within 12 months, and Lascelles would become his Private Secretary in 1943. The Duke of York said to him halfway through the journey, “What’s all this about the King not being well?” George V died within four days. The soulless Edward was king.</p>
<p>And so, from a combination of lassitude, duty, and blue-blooded patriotism, Lascelles ended up as Assistant Private Secretary to a man he was morally repulsed by. Gentlemen do not just drop out of Royal service because they dislike the new King. It is perhaps surprising that Edward kept Lascelles on. But it seems obvious from this distance — as it seemed to Lascelles then — that Edward had never planned to make it that far and wasn’t going to stay long.</p>
<p>The royal family is meant to bring spectacle to our lives by displaying theirs: a glittering pageant of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. As the monarchy lost power through the nineteenth century, they replaced it with performance. Public engagement became Queen Victoria’s way of maintaining her relevance. And this new mode of royal existence is part of what made Edward VIII such a star as Prince of Wales: his tours of America, Canada, and South Africa were massive successes. But by the end of George V’s reign, British royalty had consolidated a new covenant with the people: “private probity, public spectacle.”</p>
<p>Lascelles was the high priest of the Georgian model and had seen first-hand that Edward was all public spectacle and no private probity. A courtier out of duty (and because he found nothing else to do), he realised that unless the royal family stuck to its principles — to the principles forced on it by a changing world — it would suffer. To the extent that he was a propagandist, an enemy of Edward VIII, a reactionary, and everything else he is claimed to be, it was because he realised the royal family had very little choice. Much of what Lascelles is said to have brought about may well have been inevitable as monarchy adjusted to democracy.</p>
<p>He had always been a slightly unwilling courtier. (He told his daughter long after he retired that, if he could have his life again, he would breed horses. “Racehorses, or cart-horses: any sort of horses.”) He was good at it, though. It remains to be seen whether he will eventually be remembered as the last of the old school who helped the monarchy transition to its modern function — or as a crusty old reactionary who needlessly destroyed a clutch of happy lives. But when his archives are eventually dusted off, I doubt we will find any dark secrets in there. We already know the fundamentals. He was a man who believed in royal morals underpinning royal spectacles.</p>

<p>What would he make of the modern monarchy? In his 1990 review of Philip Ziegler’s <em>Edward VIII</em>, Christopher Hitchens <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/For_the_Sake_of_Argument/bJbCBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+magic+of+the+throne+is+now+inextricable+from+Charles+and+the+Annenbergs,+Diana+and+Donald+Trump+%E2%80%93+the+extension+of+Edward%E2%80%99s+international+white-trash+habit+into+modern+showbiz+and+celeb+culture.%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PT255&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed</a> that “the magic of the throne is now inextricable from Charles and the Annenbergs, Diana and Donald Trump — the extension of Edward’s international white-trash habit into modern showbiz and celeb culture.” This line might stand as a eulogy for the Lascelles’s school: that there is little point in having a Royal Family unless they adhere to certain difficult and sometimes out-of-date principles. For Lascelles, as for the public at that time, those principles were about marriage. One of the last things he did was sit in the garden of Kensington Palace to watch the firework celebrations of Charles and Diana’s wedding. The next day, he asked for news about the event every few minutes, anxious it should all be going well. He died two weeks later.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the sort of revelations we have heard about the Royal Family since would have been anathema to his sense of decorum. But Tommy didn’t speculate. A young man from the BBC once tried to persuade him to appear in what Lascelles called “a television orgy on The Future of the British Monarchy”. Lascelles gave a forthright reply: “I told him I would as soon walk stark naked down Piccadilly.” We might find it easy to dismiss him as an old fogey. But how confidently can we say that we are beyond his concerns about private probity? Are we above worrying about what makes an acceptable royal spouse?</p>

<section data-css="tve-u-16f805e6958"><h2>When dissent is misinformation, fallacies become facts</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>“Whoever practices this prophylaxis will experience the pleasure, not from time to time to lose every third or fourth patient from puerperal fever, but perhaps lose only one in four hundred”<br/>
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/dmckenty">Doug McKenty</a>, who does <a href="https://theshiftnow.com/">The Shift podcast</a> was just suspended by Mailchimp. He’s been getting more vocal about what he calls healthcare freedom (read: vaccine passports), and something about that coloured outside the lines.</p>
<p>Mailchimp, an email list provider, is known for doing this. You effectively pay Mailchimp to curate what you can or cannot say to your own email subscribers.  You’re using their mailservers, and in their mind that’s what gives them the right and the moral authority to monitor <em>the content</em> of your communications to your own audience.<span id="more-2580"></span></p>
<p>In my book <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">Unassailable: Protect Yourself From Deplatform Attacks, Cancel Culture and other Online Disasters</a> (the e-book version has been <a href="https://axisofeasy.com/aoe/the-missing-manual-for-defending-yourself-against-deplatforming-and-cancel-culture/">available for free</a> for some time now) I devote an entire chapter to the machinations of the Big Tech and how they overstep the bounds of rationality when it comes to deciding what is within their purview and what isn’t, or shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>No tech company should be enforcing their Terms of Service based on what they <em>think</em> their users have done or <em>might do</em> off of their own platforms. Yet Twitter, Facebook, Patreon and who knows who else do that.</p>
<p>A mailer company like Mailchimp has no business even parsing the content of their paying clients, let alone summarily judging whether it is misinformation or not. Mail providers should care about two things and two things only:</p>
<ol>
<li>The list is clean (opt-in and confirmed)</li>
<li> The mailings aren’t infected with any kind of malware.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. Beyond that it really isn’t their business and it’s the height of grandiosity and hubris to think that it is.</p>
<p>Patreon’s CEO Jack Conte <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmcK6GvgVPs">describes how</a> their Trust and Safety Team remove all subjective elements from the decision to demonetize somebody’s content by evaluating them based on “Manifest Observable Behaviour”:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Manifest observable behavior is to remove personal values and beliefs when the team is reviewing content. It’s a review method that’s <strong>entirely based on observable facts</strong>: <strong>what has a camera seen</strong>, <strong>what has an audio device recorded</strong>. It doesn’t matter what your intentions are, your motivations, who you are, your identity, your ideology. The trust and safety team only looks at Manifest Observable Behaviour. We get rigorous and specific because we’re talking about removing a person’s income. The authority to take away a human being’s income is a sobering responsibility. It is not something to be done on a whim.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What does this process resemble? It actually sounds a lot like a legal proceeding, albeit one that’s entirely one-sided, devoid of any semblance of due process or legal protection under the law, and probably carried out by teams of purple-haired Millennials with nose hoops and personal pronoun mood-rings.</p>
<p>When tech companies take it upon themselves to arbitrate what is or isn’t misinformation, or taking action based on events that occur outside of their own platforms what they are doing, at its core, is adjudicating international law. Do you really want your domain registrar or your web host doing that?</p>
<p>These companies think they’re the patricians of internet discourse. The reality is they’re the plumbing.</p>
<h2>Fact Checks, Fallacies and Misinformation</h2>
<p>“Fact Checks” are another entirely subjective catch phrase dolled up to look like objective truth. These days a fact check is more likely to be a logical fallacy and the reality is, most people don’t even know what logical fallacies<em> are.</em></p>
<p>When the <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/late-stage-globalism-when-anything-that-is-not-censored-is-a-lie/">Associated Press “fact checked” US Senate testimony on the efficacy of Ivermectin</a> claiming <em>“there is no evidence that Ivermectin is a ‘miracle drug’ against COVID” </em>and they labeled it <em>false</em>, they committed a logical fallacy called “appeal to ignorance” (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).</p>
<p>The vast majority of all media narrative around COVID-19, on masks, lockdowns, Ivermectin, HCQ and yes, vaccines, can be categorized into <em>five</em> logical fallacies:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority"><strong>Appeal to Authority:</strong></a> whatever experts and unaccountable technocrats say is objectively true. If you disagree with the experts you are disputing science itself (even the ones who were neck deep in funding the gain-of-function research that quite possibly led to the lab release that caused the pandemic).</li>
<li><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon"><strong>Bandwagon:</strong></a> Because everybody else believes something, you have a moral obligation to believe it too. Anything you’ve come across or read that contradicts what everybody else believes to be true is “misinformation”.</li>
<li><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem"><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong></a> is not an argument at all, it’s an attack. “Covidiots”, “Deniers” these are not rational counter-arguments, they’re slurs. Anybody employing them is not  engaging in discourse but rather bigotry and prejudice. This is as inexcusable as racism. Over the past few years many have been challenged to examine their own biases and privilege, in certain contexts for perfectly valid reasons. Anybody engaging in this type of othering toward skeptics and contrarians lacks self-awareness and empathy to the same degree as a racist.</li>
<li><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-emotion"><strong>Appeal To Emotion:</strong></a> Corporate media thrives on fear. Social media platforms on anger. It’s why every time CNN says “Delta variant” it is “highly contagious” instead of “less fatal”. If everybody knew that <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf">recent data out of the UK</a> (among others) indicates the Delta variant has a fatality rate that’s even lower than the already quite low Alpha variant, basically the same as seasonal flu, then they may just calm down. And we can’t have that.</li>
<li><a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/special-pleading"><strong>Moving the Goalposts</strong>:</a> 15-days to flatten the curve became #NoJabNoJob in about 18 months. You’re still supposed to wear a mask if you’re fully vaccinated, the media has already decided that a fourth wave will occur in the fall and the really forward looking thinkers are gearing us up for climate lockdowns.  “We’re all in this together” turned into that Dr. Seuss story about the Sneeches. Also, Dr Seuss got canceled.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p>There are those that believe there is no subjectivity involved in any of this. They think, as Jack Conte does, that there are standalone objective truths, like Manifest Observable Behaviour. Realms where nuance, uncertainty and conflicting data are banished. All right thinking people grok The Truth and only wrong thinking people dispute it.</p>
<p>Triggernometry’s Konstantin Kissin recently put out a Twitter thread on vaccine hesitancy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">You’re struggling to understand why some people are vaccine hesitant. The “let me help you” megathread:</p>
<p>Imagine you’re a normal person. The year is 2016. Rightly or wrongly, you believe most of what you see in the media.</p>
<p>— Konstantin Kisin, wrong opinions within (@KonstantinKisin) <a href="https://twitter.com/KonstantinKisin/status/1422181544161128450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>


<p>It lays out the case, fairly cogently, why the general public may just simply be confused, distrustful and hesitant as opposed to being morally reprobate monsters. Further, it enumerates, in painstaking detail, multiple pillars of official canon which turned out to be, misinformation, for lack of a better word (unless that word is <em>“lies”). </em></p>
<p>We see Fauci removing his mask the moment the cameras stop rolling. We see AOC sitting amongst a fairly close knit crowd put one on for the express purpose of a photo op and then take it off again. But if you send an email to your own subscribers via Mailchimp wondering out loud if masks are nothing more than performative theatre, you’ll get shut down.</p>
<p>How does any of this establish the credibility and public trust required to mobilize that last 20% to 30% needed to (purportedly) achieve herd immunity? It doesn’t.</p>
<p>From WMD in Iraq being a “slum dunk” through “Subprime is Contained” to “Tapering will be like watching paint dry”, anybody who has actually been keeping track of the expert authorities track records <em>over the past 20 years</em> has legitimate reason to believe that experts don’t know anything. At least nothing of <em>predictive </em>value.</p>
<p>Another chapter in <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2019/10/22/unassailable-the-book-that-protects-you-from-cancel-culture-and-deplatform-attacks/">my boo</a>k asks the question ‘Does Deplatforming Even Work?’ Short answer is: it doesn’t. Over the long haul suppression of material amplifies it. If you want fewer unhinged conspiracy theories circulating about COVID, stop deplatforming anybody who isn’t mindlessly parroting Fauci.</p>
<p>What is really needed is a society-wide <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/cracking-the-contrarians-code/">crash course in critical thinking</a>, and not to be incessantly hectored and told what <em>not </em>to think. The Davos crew, the entrenched elites of late stage globalism think we’re headed toward a world managed by expert technocrats. But they haven’t exactly put up a string of successes and this approach to public policy has arguably failed its most important test.</p>
<p>We’re headed toward a decentralized world governed by consensus as expressed through open source protocols and smart contracts. The battle is not about left vs right, conservative vs liberal where either side would have you believe that content cleanly bisects into Truth and Misinformation. The defining tension of the next 20 years will between decentralization vs bureaucracy, platforms vs protocols and nation states vs networks.</p>
<p>As for the opening quote of today’s piece? Semmelweis lived a tragic life. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/01/12/375663920/the-doctor-who-championed-hand-washing-and-saved-women-s-lives">battle to convince the medical establishment</a> of his day that <em>washing ones hands </em> after performing an autopsy and before delivering a baby would prevent the spread of  “cadaverous particles” from corpses to mothers and newborns was seen as delusional. Surely AP would have “fact checked” it as <em>false.</em> Politifact would have rated it <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/21/politifact-quietly-retracts-fact-check-of-covid-19-wuhan-lab-theory/">“pants on fire”</a>. After all, that there was no such thing as <em>germs</em> was settled science.</p>
<p>The stress of the scorn and demonization took a lot out of Semmelweis. He apparently aged the equivalent of decades in just three years since he commenced his writing campaign in 1857 promoting his theories until the publication of his Aetiology in 1860.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He died alone and in ignominy, having been committed to a mental institution by his medical peers.</p>

            <p>
            Recently while searching for a book on <a href="https://bookshop.org/">Bookshop.org</a>, I was interrupted by a popup apparently generated by Microsoft Edge advising me of an alternative:
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            Excuse me? The assumption that I need help buying a book is the biggest insult I’ve encountered on Windows since the days of Clippy.
            </p>
            <p>
            A further insult is the implication that I make buying decisions based solely on price. There might be numerous reasons why I choose one retailer over another for my book purchases. I might prefer a retailer that focuses solely on books, or a retailer that is not a large chain. More generally, I might make a decision based on the company’s carbon footprint, or perhaps their reputation in paying fair wages, or what political candidates and movements they support, or whether the CEO uses his wealth to launch himself into space.
            </p>
            <p>
            Of course, these concepts are entirely beyond the scope of Edge’s braindead algorithm that apparently knows only whether one number is larger than another.

      <title>The macOS Sandbox File Limit</title>
      <link>https://buckleyisms.com/blog/anecdotes-about-the-macos-sandbox-file-limit/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  
  <p><em>As always, this post reflects my own opinions, and not anyone else’s.</em></p>
<p>There has recently been some <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1422631677000617985">renewed discussion on Twitter</a> about the limitation that the macOS sandbox places on the number of open files an app can access at once. Apps are still running into problems because of this limitation, and there is not a lot of technical detail available on it outside of Apple, so I’d like to share my understanding of it.</p>
<p>macOS only allows sandboxed apps to access a limited number of files at a time, but there is no way for an app to query how many files it can open, or if it’s close to the limit. In fact, this limit is dependent on the amount of RAM installed in the computer and the number of files open by other apps. Because this limit only affects apps that can batch process thousands of files, and users that want to do so, many users—and developers—remain unaware of it, despite the fact that it has affected some of Apple’s own apps.</p>
<p>I first became aware of the limitation in early 2012. I was working on an app that could activate font files, and although most users only used it for a handful of fonts at a time, we very quickly got support requests from users after the limitation was introduced in an update to OS X 10.7. In this case, however, it wasn’t obvious what was causing the issue. Font activation would start failing with a generic error code after the first few hundred activations. The system log reported that the sandbox was denying <code>file-read-data</code> for our app, but our app wasn’t sandboxed, so this appeared to be a bug.</p>
<p>Although we attempted to fix the problem, both by ourselves and with the help of Apple’s Developer Tech Support, it wasn’t until WWDC 2012, a few months later, that we were able to get answers on why this was happening. At WWDC, I lined up for the labs as soon as I could and was eventually able to talk with an engineer who worked on font activation. After sharing some code with him that demonstrated the problem, he was able to find exactly where in the font daemon the failure was occurring. When attempting to open the font file, the daemon was receiving a generic error that the file could not be opened. However, he wasn’t sure exactly who to talk to about that problem, so he gave be a page of detailed notes, along with suggestions of other engineers to talk to, and which labs they would be in.</p>
<p>All of the engineers were helpful and wanted to get to the bottom of this mystery, but they all had to suggest other engineers to speak with, until ultimately, I was referred to an engineer in the security lab. It was late in the day, and labs were about to close. I distinctly remember running across the room to the section blocked off for the security lab, laptop under my arm. There, I met an extremely helpful engineer who was able to solve the mystery.</p>
<p>macOS uses security-scoped bookmarks to grant apps access to files they normally wouldn’t have access to. In order to facilitate this, macOS must keep a mapping of which apps are allowed to access which file paths, and for security reasons, this mapping has to live in kernel memory. Kernel memory is wired: The kernel has no access to virtual memory. A quarter of physical RAM is reserved for the kernel, and within that quarter, the kernel allocates a percentage for the file mapping.</p>
<p>He never said it outright, but I got the impression that the security team had just learned that this was causing problems for apps recently, and only because they were notified by the iPhotos team, but they were unaware it was causing problems with the font daemon. Our radars, DTS tickets, and emails with our Apple rep had failed to get the problem through to the security team. As an aside, this is why WWDC labs are so important and valuable. It is often impossible to get issues noticed by the proper engineers inside Apple. Even if they can’t fix the issues, engineers in the labs can often provide information and workarounds.</p>
<p>The engineer stayed late to help me file radars on the issue for both the security team and the fonts team, but cautioned that the underlying problem would probably not get fixed any time soon. It would be up to app developers and other teams within Apple to work around the problems the limitation created. It was foundational to how the macOS app sandbox was designed, and could only be fixed if they found a safe and performant way to store this mapping in userspace, which was unlikely. Apple was not going to throw out the sandbox or compromise its security to remove this limitation. Considering that it remains a problem to this day, he was right.</p>
<p>From outside of Apple, it appears that very little has changed in the app sandbox since its debut in 2011. Many exception entitlements are still “temporary”. When these temporary exceptions were introduced, Apple encouraged developers to file radars explaining why they needed the exceptions, indicating that Apple would, in the future, expand the sandbox to cover use cases that necessitated these exceptions, then remove the temporary entitlements. As far as I am aware, although security holes have been patched in the sandbox, and new entitlements added, the sandbox has never been expanded to include these use cases, and no temporary exception has ever been removed, making “temporary” somewhat of a misnomer.</p>
<p>Having never worked at Apple, I will refrain from uneducated guesses as to why this is. Considering that this limitation <a href="https://twitter.com/Schwieb/status/1238538962710323200">still affects high-profile apps like Microsoft Office</a>, I don’t think Apple is unmotivated to fix this, but considering how long it has remained a problem, until Apple announces otherwise, we can’t assume it’s going away any time soon. It’s on app developers to work around it as best as possible.</p>
<p>There are two ways to deal with the issue. The first is to <strong>relinquish security-scoped bookmarks as quickly as possible</strong>, and the second is to <strong>prompt users to open folders, not files</strong>.</p>
<p>Security-scoped bookmarks can be relinquished using <code>NSURL</code>&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurl/1413736-stopaccessingsecurityscopedresou"><code>stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource</code></a> method. This method frees the entry for the file in the kernel. If your app only needs to access a few files at a time, you can call this method immediately when you are done with each file.</p>
<p>In cases where this does not work, you can prompt users to open folders instead of files. When a folder is opened in an <code>NSOpenPanel</code>, only one entry is added in kernel memory, but your app will still be able to access the files within that folder. However, you may need to limit yourself to APIs that access those files using string paths, rather than <code>NSURL</code>s. After opening the folder, your app will need to enumerate the contents of the folder and provide its own file listing for users to select files. Any files opened through <code>NSOpenPanel</code> will consume kernel memory.</p>
<p>In my case, thanks to the help I received at WWDC 2012, I was able to learn that the font daemon properly relinquished bookmarks when fonts were activated using the CoreText API, as opposed to the newly-deprecated ATS API we were using. We were able to switch over to CoreText, but Carbon apps, which all used ATS, wouldn’t be able to see all of the activated fonts. It appeared that these apps, upon being notified of font activations, would communicate with the font daemon to get the font data using ATS functions, which were still not relinquishing the bookmarks quickly enough. As far as I know, this has never been fixed, but since Carbon was never fully ported to 64-bit, Carbon app usage declined until 32-bit support was removed in macOS 10.15, making the problem moot.</p>
<p>At the time, however, many popular apps were written using Carbon, or at least contained enough Carbon code to be affected by this issue, including Microsoft Office and parts of the Adobe Creative Suite. We had to add an alert to our app when users attempted to activate a large number of fonts, explaining that not all fonts would be available in these apps. Some users complained bitterly, but we had a compelling demo to prove that the problem was not our app’s fault. If users simply moved all their font files into <code>~/Library/Fonts</code>, they could confirm that the fonts were all available in TextEdit, but not in Word.</p>

      <title>Summer 2021 has changed our understanding of extreme weather</title>
      <link>https://theconversation.com/how-summer-2021-has-changed-our-understanding-of-extreme-weather-165268</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A succession of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c59ca047-082e-48fb-a479-df1b2818a66c">record-breaking natural disasters</a> have swept the globe in recent weeks. There have been serious floods in China and western Europe, heatwaves and drought in North America and wildfires in the sub-Arctic.</p>

<p>An annual <a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.7285">report</a> on the UK’s weather indicates extreme events are becoming commonplace in the country’s once mild climate. August 2020 saw temperatures hit 34°C on six consecutive days across southern England, including five sticky nights where the mercury stayed above 20°C. In the future, British summers are likely to see temperatures greater than 40°C regularly, even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C.</p>

<p>The Canadian national temperature record was shattered in June 2021 meanwhile, with 49.6°C recorded in Lytton, British Columbia – a town that was all but destroyed by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57678054">wildfires</a> a few days later. </p>

<p>Many of these events have shocked climate scientists. The Lytton temperature record, for example, was head-and-shoulders above those set during previous heatwaves in the region. Some scientists are beginning to worry they might have underestimated how quickly the climate will change. Or have we just misunderstood extreme weather events and how our warming climate will influence them?</p>

    </strong>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/>


<h2>Everything is connected</h2>

<p>Floods and wildfires are not discrete events: they are the result of numerous interconnections and feedback loops in the climate system. Take the mid-July <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/25/thunderstorms-leave-cars-and-buses-stranded-in-london">flash floods in London</a>. These were caused by summer rainstorms, which were in turn driven by warm air rising from the Earth’s surface that built up during the preceding heatwave, stacking the deck for the downpours that were to follow. The wildfires raging in the western US, meanwhile, are a catastrophe whose stage was set by <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-north-american-heatwave-shows-we-need-to-know-how-climate-change-will-change-our-weather-163802">long-term drought</a>.</p>

<p>The Earth’s climate is complex, dynamic and chaotic, involving interactions and energy fluxes between the land, ocean and atmosphere. The idea that scientists can study one part of this system in relative isolation is flawed. But it was not always possible to model or understand all of these complexities, so scientists had to break them into manageable pieces in order to fit them into linear systems and models. These were often split across the scientific disciplines that most of us are still somewhat confined to today, such as atmospheric sciences, hydrology, Earth systems sciences, or engineering. </p>

<p>As a result, we are used to treating each natural hazard independently from another. But it takes more than rain to create a flood, and more than a spark to start a wildfire. All of the elements of our climate system – and the hazards it produces – are connected in one way or another. </p>

<figure>
            
            <figcaption>
              <span>Recent flash floods in London were triggered by the sudden end of a heatwave.</span>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>It’s not that these interactions and combinations are new, it’s just that we haven’t always thought about them in such a joined-up way. It may seem shocking when disaster follows disaster, seemingly in increasingly quick succession. This is because we are trained to think about weather hazards singularly, focused on one type – a drought or flood, for example – at a time. Just about all risk assessments underestimate the risks associated with interconnected events.</p>

<p>But as our climate continues to warm, its baseline is shifting. How these hazards and their causes interact is therefore also changing fast, challenging the very definition of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>The interconnections between extreme weather events have, until recently, been largely overlooked by the science community. But there is now growing <a href="http://damocles.compoundevents.org/">international research</a> tasked with mapping these complex relationships.</p>

<p>Compound events – a term only adopted by the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/managing-the-risks-of-extreme-events-and-disasters-to-advance-climate-change-adaptation/">IPCC in 2012</a> – describe the outcomes of a combination of causes that ultimately surpass the capacity of an underlying system to cope. These include <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0060-z">events</a> where a hazard like a wildfire was made worse by something which had preconditioned the environment, like drought.</p>

<p>Wariness of these compound events should influence the way we live our lives in a warmer world. More research across disciplines is needed, as well as new approaches to disaster risk assessment and climate change adaptation that look across all weather-driven hazards and their complex and changing interactions. Improvements in <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2021/hadley-centre-work-program-2021">climate modelling</a> mean we can do more of this type of science – the climate crisis dictates that we must.</p>

      <title>Show HN: Yet another Homebrew Video Game Console, this time FPGA-based</title>
      <link>https://internalregister.github.io/2021/08/08/Another-Homebrew-Console.html</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
<p></p>

<p>Over two years after my first post on a Homebrew Video Game Console, I’m writing another one on a new Homebrew video game console.</p>

<p>I’m horrible on posting updates to my projects, so this is another monstrous post, showing my newest project.</p>

<p>As I’ve done in other posts, I’ll try to explain what made me build another console, the decision process while designing and building it as well as the final result.</p>

<p>Along the way I’ll try explain some concepts (or at least how I understand them) that may be simple or well known to some, but maybe it’ll helpful for others. 
I will also use my other homemade console as a comparison (link <a href="https://internalregister.github.io/2019/03/14/Homebrew-Console.html">here</a>). 
There’ll be links on topics that I feel could be worthy of further exploration by the reader.</p>



<p>I do have a tendency to start many different projects, I’m constantly thinking of other possibilities and ways to improve and change current projects, even before I finish them. 
And while I was finishing the other console I was already thinking on how I could do better or at least do different.</p>

<p>I really like my first video game console, but is has a few drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updates the screen at 25 frames per second</li>
  <li>Has a one frame delay between updating and rendering</li>
  <li>No color palettes</li>
  <li>Resolution of 224x192 (a bit less than I was hoping for)</li>
  <li>It’s a really complex design with a lot of different components</li>
</ul>

<p>Added to this, a friend of mine told me: “hey, I would really like to own one of those”, and being so complex and huge made it very hard and expensive to replicate.</p>

<p>So, I set off to make a video game console which improves in some aspects, but it’s not necessarily an evolution over the first one.</p>



<p>Having this in mind, I had some must-haves for the new console, some new and some I brought over from the previous project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the game logic there must be an 8-bit CPU</li>
  <li>It must have sound</li>
  <li>Graphics
    <ul>
      <li>Resolution of 256x224 pixels, a more standard resolution when comparing to other retro systems</li>
      <li>Tiled background</li>
      <li>Multiple sprites on top of the background</li>
      <li>Possibility of using palettes for the background and sprites</li>
      <li>Ability to change some graphical configurations mid-frame</li>
      <li>50 fps (PAL frequency) with no frame delays</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It must be able to load programs through an SD Card</li>
  <li>Have support for two game controllers</li>
  <li>There must be few components and a small form factor</li>
  <li>Is cheaper to make and easier to put together than the first one</li>
  <li>There must be no software emulation and there must be no components too powerful that they would need to be extremely underused or slowed down to keep it retro-styled</li>
</ul>



<p>After this I started to research what components I could use so that I ended up with the fewest possible but enough to make everything work, of course. 
And a constant in these kinds of projects, nothing too overkill, no software emulation, no mini-pc boards, nothing like that.</p>

<p> 
(the console when in breadboards)</p>

<h3 id="fgpa">FGPA</h3>

<p>This project gave me the opportunity to work with a kind of component I’ve always wanted to work with: <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array" target="_blank">FPGAs</a> (Field Programmable Gate Array).
FPGAs are versatile components that can be configured to behave as different circuits. 
Most video game consoles back in the day had specific chips for things like video and sound and for most hobbyists building their own <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIC" target="_blank">ASICs</a> is simply not an option, so using FPGAs are a great alternative to this. 
Besides, all “the cool kids” are using it and I wanted to use it as well.</p>

<p>In my last console I’ve used something similar, a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_device" target="_blank">PLD</a> (Programmable Logic Device) to help with some of the glue logic and save on 7400 series ICs that needed to be used.</p>

<p>FPGAs however have some differences in comparison to PLDs or CPLDs, in most cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>they don’t support 5V logic (most retro systems from the 80s and early 90s are 5V)</li>
  <li>their configuration is saved in an external component and loaded into the FPGA when powered on (there’s a slight delay when turned on)</li>
  <li>they generally support greater speeds and more complex circuits configured</li>
  <li>they have internal RAM usable by the configured circuits</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a design for an FPGA usually means using a high level design language such as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL" target="_blank">VHDL</a> or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" target="_blank">Verilog</a> (there are others as well) and defining each component, inputs, outputs, behavior, etc.</p>

<p>An FPGA would enabled me to save on the number of components used as I could design many of them inside of it. 
I didn’t want however an FPGA that was way too powerful for what I was trying to accomplish (again, a personal rule for my “retro” projects: I can use current technology, but I have to make sure it’s not overpowered).</p>

<p>I also knew that I was not going to be able to design a board that would use an FPGA directly as I lack the experience in electronic circuit design to do it, so I had to pick a pre-made FPGA development board to use in the console, something cheap with an FPGA just powerful enough for the project, with a lot of available pins and no extra hardware or connectors (common in FPGA development boards).</p>

<p>I found just the board:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It retails for $12 to $15 and it can be found in several vendors such as AliExpress and Ebay at the time of writing, it has 143 Input/Output pins (not all of them available) and holds an Intel (formerly Altera) <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/cyc2/cyc2_cii5v1.pdf" target="_blank">Cyclone II EP2C5 FPGA</a>. 
(right now there are cheaper boards with more recent FGPAs, however when I bought it a few years ago it seemed to be the best and cheapest option)</p>

<p>The Cyclone II series of FPGAs is a now discontinued series although it is still widely available.</p>

<p>This model in particular has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>119.808 bits of internal RAM (known as Block RAM)</li>
  <li>4.608 logic elements</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of logic elements determines the complexity of the circuit that an FPGA can hold and 4608 is enough for a lot of the console but not amazing, FGPAs can easily have many more logic elements available.</p>

<p>It is not easy to know how many logic elements are needed for a certain circuit design until you’ve actually designed it, it’s hard to predict how a circuit is converted into an FPGA configuration, furthermore depending on the FGPA vendor, logic elements can have different meanings (they can be more or less complex) and even slightly different names making it harder to compare them.</p>

<p>The block RAM was going to be extremely useful, I knew I wanted the FGPA to at least do the video and graphics, and the interface between the CPU and graphics circuit was going to be RAM like in the previous console. 
And the block RAM can easily be configured as dual-port SRAM, which is a great way to interface two components.</p>

<p>Ultimately the circuit design I ended up with holds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80" target="_blank">Z80</a> CPU <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_core_(synthesis)" target="_blank">soft-core</a> (I used a pre-made core, the <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/t80" target="_blank">T80</a>)</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910" target="_blank">YM2149/AY-3-8910</a> audio chip soft-core (I used a pre-made core by <a href="https://opencores.org/users/mikej/profile" target="_blank">MikeJ</a> from January 2005 originallly used in an FPGA version of Bomb Jack)</li>
  <li>a custom video and graphics circuit (that I named the named Video Signal Processor and Video Display Processor)</li>
  <li>a custom <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive" target="_blank">Sega Genesis</a>-compatible controller reader circuit</li>
  <li>custom glue logic</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I mentioned above, FPGA design is usually done in a high level design language, usually <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL" target="_blank">VHDL</a> or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" target="_blank">Verilog</a>, I chose VHDL for no particular reason, simply because I found more examples on it and found some pre-made cores in that language that I could use.</p>

<p>For the development of the FPGA design, as mentioned above, I used 2 cores made by someone else, the core for the Z80 CPU and for the sound (YM2149), the rest was designed by me, including the graphics and video processing.</p>

<p>I’m still not very confident in my ability with VHDL, but it is improving. It’s easy to mistakenly start using a design language as a regular programming language, but they’re two very different things with different concepts, also it’s very hard to debug these designs as opposed to regular software, so the design went through several iterations until I was confident enough that it would consistently work in all situations.</p>



<p>Having 119.808 bits or 14.976 bytes of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" target="_blank">RAM</a> in the FPGA is great but not really enough to store all the data, code and graphics for a program to run in the console. 
So I added my trusty AS6C1008 memory IC, it has 128KB of SRAM at 55ns and it can work with either 3.3V or 5V voltage levels. 
This means I could interface it directly with the FPGA board as it interfaces with 3.3V but not 5V.</p>

<p>The usage of the memory available in this IC is split into two. 
The first 64KB is accessed exclusively by the CPU and it serves to store the code and data for the programs. 
The second 64KB is what I call the Character RAM (CHRRAM) and it stores graphics, this is accessed by the CPU through the IO port and by the VDP to render frames.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="sd-card-reader">SD card reader</h3>

<p>As one of the requirements is the ability to load programs from an SD Card, I needed a way to read them. 
I could design a circuit in the FGPA for this, but the FPGA ended up pretty much full without this, so I felt I could sneak in my also trusty Atmega microcontroller to do the trick and save on the FGPA “real estate” (the number of logic elements used).</p>

<p>Originally I used an Atmega324 just like in the previous console and also reused most of the code to access the SD Card. Although I thought I could do a little better, so I ended up swapping it for an Atmega328, the same used in the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank">Arduino Uno</a>. 
This one has less pins (it’s smaller) and it’s a lot cheaper. The only drawback is that with the lack of pins, I would only be able to interface with the CPU with an address bus of 6 bits instead of the 8 bits I used in the other console. That meant I had only 64 read and 64 write instructions available, but, it was actually more than enough.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="video-encoding">Video encoding</h3>

<p>For video, to minimize the space used in the board I opted for composite video output only, instead of RGB video out. This way it would only need a small video output connector. 
To do this I needed a video encoder to generate the composite video signal. 
In the previous console I had used a vintage chip for this which is no longer manufactured, a Sony CXA1645 (???). This time I went for a modern IC, an AD724. 
It’s package is not very hobbyist friendly, but I managed to solder it to an adapter board and use it just fine.</p>

<p>The FPGA produces 8-bit RGB color signals and a Sync signal and the AD724 converts this to a composite signal.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="audio-amplification">Audio amplification</h3>

<p>And for audio I used an LM358 as an audio amplifier, I believe it’s not the best IC for this, but it does the job. 
This IC amplifies the audio signal output by the FPGA.</p>

<h3 id="final-look">Final look</h3>

<p>This is the console’s final look, the FPGA’s development board is plugged into the console’s board.</p>

<p></p>



<h3 id="general-architecture">General Architecture</h3>

<p>Here are all the components, physical and in the FPGA design:</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="cpu-and-ram-and-io-mapping">CPU and RAM and IO mapping</h3>

<p>The soft-core CPU in the FPGA is a Z80 compatible CPU running at 16.66Mhz. 
As explained in previous posts one of the Z80’s advantages is that it has a 16-bit memory space as well as a 16-bit IO space. 
Althought they can’t be used in parallel, it enables me to use the full 16-bit of memory for the program and leave acessing other components to the IO space.</p>

<h4 id="memory-space">Memory space</h4>

<p>The code that is first executed when the console is turned on is located in 4KB of RAM inside in the FPGA.</p>

<p>The CPU has access to a full 64KB of RAM, the first 4KB of RAM can be switched between the first 4KB of the 128KB RAM chip and 4KB of RAM (Block RAM) in the FPGA.</p>

<p>A special address IO space can be used to switch between the internal 4KB RAM and external RAM.</p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="io-space">IO space</h4>

<p>Through the IO space it’s possible to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communicate with the IO IC (Atmega328) which is used to access data from the SD Card</li>
  <li>Read and write to the VDP RAM which defines the scene to be rendered</li>
  <li>Send commands to the YM2149/AY-3-8910 soft-core (audio processor)</li>
  <li>Switch the first 4KB of RAM from internal to external RAM</li>
  <li>Read game controller status</li>
  <li>Read and write to Character RAM in two 32KB banks</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3 id="video-and-graphics">Video and Graphics</h3>

<h4 id="video">Video</h4>

<p>For the video I went for what I’m already used to, a 50Hz <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL" target="_blank">PAL</a> analog video signal, since it’s the standard here in Portugal. 
The resolution is 256x224 and each pixel has one of 256 colors in the color space RGB 332, the same as in the previous console.</p>

<p>
(available colors)</p>

<h4 id="graphics">Graphics</h4>

<p>The graphics are located in the Character RAM, which is 64KB of the external RAM.</p>

<p>They are arranged (like with the last console) in 8x8 pixel tiles each in 64 consecutive bytes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Originally I wanted to only have 4bpp graphics (4 bits per pixel or 16 colors per pixel) and use color palettes to map each of the 16 colors to the final color in RGB332 space. 
However I found that not using palettes is much easier and palettes are not always necessary.</p>

<p>For this reason I made it possible to choose between using 4bpp with color palettes or 8bpp graphics, both for the background plane and sprites, making the VDP more complex as a consequence, but it works.</p>

<p>This way the number of characteres/tiles available in the 64KB of CHRRAM depends on the use of 4bpp or 8bpp graphics. It can hold up to 1024 8bpp characters or up to 2048 4bpp characters or a combination of both.</p>

<h4 id="video-display-processor-vdp">Video Display Processor (VDP)</h4>

<p>The VDP is capable of combining a background with multiple sprites.</p>

<p>As in the first console and like in many retro consoles of the 80s and early 90s, the background is a virtual screen composed of 8x8 pixel tiles. The virtual screen has 64x64 tiles (in a total of 512x512 pixels) and can be scrolled horizontally and vertically.</p>

<p>The background can also be 8bpp or 4bpp, if it’s 4bpp (16 colors) than it will use any of the available 16 palettes for the colors. 
It’s possible to use 4 different palettes in the same background at a time, each tile can only use one at a time.</p>

<p>The VDP can render 128 sprites, each one 8x8 or 16x16 pixels in size, they can also be flipped horizontally and/or vertically. 
Each sprite can also be 8bpp or 4bpp in color. And in case of the latter, one of the 16 palettes can be set for each sprite.</p>

<p></p>

<p>One of the things I wanted this console to have was a second background layer that could sit behind or above sprites, I had to let this go as I was having problems including this in the FPGA because of the amount of logic elements I had available and also because of timing, every horizontal line in a frame has to be rendered in 64 microseconds, the time it takes for the TV to show a horizontal line in PAL.</p>

<p>Because I couldn’t do this, I managed to add another feature. If the background is in 4bpp mode, then it’s possible to set each sprite above or behind the 8 last colors of the palette of the background. 
It’s not the same but it’s a nice addition and can do the trick for the most part.</p>

<p>In this example, the background is using this palette:
</p>

<p>And so each individual sprite can be controlled to be “hidden behind” the pixels using any of the last 8 colors of the palette (index &gt;= 7):</p>

<p></p>

<p>Every horizontal line of the frame is rendered independently and the VDP reads the scene configuration from the VDP RAM to know what to render:</p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="hdma">HDMA</h4>

<p>Another feature of the VDP is HDMA (H-Blank Direct Memory Access, I chose this name because the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">Super Nintendo</a> had a similar feature). 
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA" target="_blank">DMA</a> (Direct Memory Access) are usually systems that allow access to memory without the CPU’s assistance or interference. 
In video game consoles they’re usually used to transfer data blocks from the several types of memory (main memory, graphics memory, sound memory, etc) faster than doing it by software, this can happen at the end of a frame or, for example, after rendering to the screen a certain horizontal line of the frame.</p>

<p>In this case I wanted to change the VDP RAM after rendering a horizontal line which could be used for some cool tricks, such has changing the palette of colors (underwater effects, etc), changing the scrolling values (split-screen, parallax effects, etc) and others. 
So in the VDP RAM there is a section for HDMA, in which you can configure a set of blocks of bytes to be copied to somewhere else in the VDP RAM after a given horizontal line.</p>

<p>
(In this example the HDMA is changing the palette colors at the end of a frame’s horizontal line, that line is then being changed every frame by the program)</p>

<h3 id="drawing-and-rendering">Drawing and Rendering</h3>

<p>For the Video Display Processor and the Video Signal Processor to work simultaneously I used a line-buffer as opposed to a frame-buffer as in the last console. With this technique I can have both systems work together and there won’t be a 1 frame delay between drawing and showing the frame.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Each frame has 256x224 pixels, so each horizontal line has 256 pixels and since in the end, with or without palettes, the color resolution is always 8bpp (8 bits per pixel or 256 colors), I needed two 256 byte buffers.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, The graphics processor needs to render an entire line of a frame in the time it takes a line to be sent to the TV, which in PAL is 64 microseconds.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-graphics-ram-between-vdp-and-cpu">Sharing Graphics RAM between VDP and CPU</h3>

<p>Unlike in my previous console, the CPU and Graphics processor use the same RAM IC simultaneously and it’s not a dual-port RAM IC, so access to it needs to be managed as only one component can use it at a time.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this was to disable the CPU when the RAM is being used by the Video Display Processor, which is not always active.</p>

<p>Every frame in progressive PAL has 312 lines, not all of them are visible. 
The VDP is only active when rendering the visible lines.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The VDP renders each frame in 224 of these lines, in which it needs to access the RAM IC, so when the VSP is sending to the TV the line before, a BUS request is sent to the CPU for it to halt and surrender access to the memory bus. 
When the 224 lines are rendered, the request ends and the CPU can resume work.</p>

<p>So the CPU only works about 27.8% (87 out of the 312 lines) of the time. 
Which may not seem like much, but it’s enough.</p>

<p>This strategy of halting the CPU while the graphics processor is using the same RAM IC was used in other systems before, like the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_spectrum" target="_blank">ZX Spectrum</a>, for example.</p>

<p>In my previous project, the CPU didn’t have direct access to the Character RAM and had to use the graphics component as an intermediary to move information into this RAM.</p>

<p>In this console the CPU can actually change the graphics in run-time, although it can’t move much data because of its processing power and only running 27.8% of the time.</p>



<h3 id="programs--games">Programs / Games</h3>

<p>Developing programs for this console is very similar to the last one, even though software is not compatible between them as the graphical and sound capabilities are different and the IO memory mapping is different as well.</p>

<p>Once again the choice can be made between <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">assembly language</a> and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/C" target="_blank">C</a>. 
C provides more productivity, so apart from early testing programs, all the software was written in this language.</p>

<p>For the C programs I reused the same toolchain I already had since the CPU is the same and the way graphics are stored is very similar as well.</p>

<p>For the C programs I still use the <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SDCC</a> compiler. The only quirk about this compiler is that it expects code to be in a ROM and data to be in a separate RAM. 
This means that in some cases such as initialized global variables it creates unecessary code. 
The console runs all its code in RAM. So to go around compile all my C files to assembly than run a custom python script to rearrange the assembly code a bit and only then I compile the resulting code together to form the final binary.</p>

<p>Just like in the previous console, in C, like the former console, I changed the crt0 of the programs so that two functions are required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>main: where the start code</li>
  <li>nmi: code that gets executed everyframe, Z80 NMI interrupt</li>
</ul>

<p>One difference from the first console is that this one doesn’t have any predefined graphics (Character ROM, like I called it), so you always need to provide some graphics with the program or write them dinamically to the Character RAM.</p>

<p>
(example of the toolchain process to produce a file that can be placed in the SD Card to be read by the console’s program loader, the binary for the program is produced and combined with the graphics binaries to produce the file that is put into the SD Card)</p>

<h3 id="bootloader">Bootloader</h3>

<p>The bootloader is the program that is first executed when the console is turned on.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This program is located in the internal RAM in the FPGA as the console boots up. 
It takes up a maximum to 4KB of RAM.</p>

<p>The bootloader loads a program from the SD Card into memory, it loads the program in file “program.pr2”.</p>

<p>This function can be accessed by any program as it sits in a specific address of the internal 4KB RAM.</p>

<p>This means that any program can load another program into memory and use the full 64KB of RAM for code and data.</p>

<p>The Bootloader was developed in C but it has a custom crt0 to expose the function described above in a specific address.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, the logo in the bootloader (you can see it in the image above) has 14x14 tiles and 5 colors and in order to fit into the 4KB together with the other code, it had to be stored as half its size and using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" target="_blank">RLE</a> in 666 bytes and it’s decoded on runtime. I decided to make the decoding visible as it serves as a cool effect.</p>

<h3 id="pr2">PR2</h3>

<p>A new console means a new file format for programs to be stored in. 
In the previous one I had the PRG file format, and this one naturally uses the PR2 file format.</p>

<p>This is structure of the file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“PRG”,2,0</li>
  <li>Program Name (24 bytes)</li>
  <li>Author (24 bytes)</li>
  <li>Icon (256 bytes, 4 8x8 pixel tiles 8bpp)</li>
  <li>Program size (2 bytes)</li>
  <li>Characters size (2 bytes)</li>
  <li>Program</li>
  <li>Characters</li>
</ul>

<p>The changes to the format are the introduction of metadata: the name of the program, name of the author and a 16x16 pixel icon.</p>

<h3 id="program-loader">Program Loader</h3>

<p>I decided to make the first program that is loaded by the bootloader the Program Loader.</p>

<p>This program uses the bootloader function to load programs into memory mentioned above.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="emulator">Emulator</h3>

<p>Just like I did for the previous console I decided early on to create an emulator to make it easier to develop for this console. 
Originally it was a separate and standalone emulator, but later I decided to rebuild it merging the emulators for both consoles into a single one.</p>

<p>The emulator was done in C++, using the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">imGUI</a> libraries.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="porting-games-from-other-systems">Porting games from other systems</h3>

<p>Because this console has a larger video resolution (256x224), it’s more viable to port games from other systems, particularly from the <a href="http://uzebox.org/index.php" target="_blank">Uzebox</a> project even though in terms of processing this console is slower that the Uzebox.</p>

<p>No need to change the game logic or graphics, just to code a layer replacing the Uzebox “system calls” to convert them to this console’s graphics, controller, sd card and audio management.</p>

<p>The sound needed some extra work as the sound chip on this console is less powerful and I made a convertion tool with less than perfect results most of the times, but it worked for the most part.</p>

<p><a href="http://uzebox.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong" target="_blank">Donkey Kong</a> ported to this console</p>

<p></p>

<p>and <a href="http://uzebox.org/wiki/Alter_Ego" target="_blank">Alter Ego</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>In a time when you can get cheap and powerful laptops and mini-PCs and other boards such as raspberry PIs where you can have complex games running on them natively or emulate tons of retro systems, why would anyone want to keep building custom underpowered retro-style game consoles?</p>

<p>Well actually I don’t really know the answer to that, although I do ask myself that question from time to time. 
All I can say is that it’s fun for me.</p>

<p>I enjoy building the whole thing from scratch and then getting to play with homemade software running on homemade hardware, there’s a sense of accomplishment in that. 
And even though everything is retro and somewhat outdated, I feel there’s still a lot of valuable knowledge to be gained from projects like this.</p>

<p>I haven’t posted the source code and schematics for this project or the last one yet and the reason is because I feel the quality might not be the best, things are developed to a point where they “work” but there’s a lot of room for optimization and making things more presentable. 
Something I never found the time to do, between my daytime job and other things in my life.</p>

<p>I do hope, though, that someone finds this interesting and useful and even if no one pursues a similar project, I hope it encourages and motivates someone to build their own “ambitious” projects.</p>

<p>I still have one last video game console I would like to build, a 16-bit CPU based console with better sound and graphics, I do have most of the components I need, I’m just not sure I’ll ever get around to do it, but we’ll see.</p>

      <title>Embarrassed by Your Olympic Javelin: Did Cavemen Do It Better?</title>

      <p>Stronger, faster, fiercer, finer. That&#39;s what the Olympics promise us — higher performance, new world records. But not if you throw things.</p>   <p>The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908. Since then, great athletes, mostly Swedes, Norwegians and Germans, kept throwing spears farther and farther until the extraordinary moment in 1984 — not at the Olympics, it was at a track and field meet in Berlin — when German Uwe Hohn threw so high, so far, he not only broke the previous world record, he scared the bejeezus out of the security people. You&#39;ve got to see this.</p>   <div id="res157493180">

            <p>Track and field 1984 Javelin World Record - Uwe Hohn DDR. 104.80 Meters</p>

                </b>
        </p></div>
</div>
   <p>Uwe&#39;s throw broke the 100-meter barrier. No one before him had thrown anywhere near that far. Maybe he got a lucky breeze; maybe he was that good. But his spear landed 104.8 meters (343.8 feet) away, and the folks who build track and field stadiums got worried. They could imagine, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/commentary/spear-a-thought-for-freakish-uwe-hohn/2006/03/25/1143084057832.html?page=fullpage">says sportswriter Steve Waldon</a>, &#34;an unsuspecting spectator [with] ... a slender, body-length metal spear between the ribs.&#34; Not a nice thought, especially to liability lawyers.</p>   <p>Also, javelins were increasingly landing flat, instead of poking upright into the turf, making distance-marking difficult, so in 1986 the <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/">I</a><a href="http://www.iaaf.org/">nternational Association of Athletics Federations&#39;</a> technical committee authorized a new javelin design. The center of gravity was moved 1.6 inches forward, the tip was modified to make the javelin <em>less aerodynamic, </em>meaning it would nose down earlier and land sooner, reducing average flight distance by about 10 percent.</p>      <p>In other words, here&#39;s an event that celebrates how far people can throw, and the officials said, &#34;Don&#39;t throw that far. Throw shorter.&#34;</p>   <div id="res157492469">

   <p><strong>&#34;Eternal&#34; World Record </strong></p>   <p>And that&#39;s what happened. Uwe Hohn&#39;s world record has been frozen. It is now </p>   <p>Actually, it&#39;s worse than that. We all know that javelin throwing is an ancient Olympic event. &#34;It&#39;s one of the few that remains from those times,&#34; says sportswriter Waldon, &#34;with discus, the marathon and sprinting, and has a certain purity because of this. You can&#39;t say the same thing about mountain bikes, for instance.&#34;</p>   <p>And people have been throwing long, skinny sticks for much, much longer. The original Olympics began around 2,700 years ago. But the original spear throwers go back another 400,000 years — that&#39;s 150 times older than the Olympics. Instead of Greeks running naked across a playing field, imagine some forest people, much hairier, probably with slightly protruding skulls, dashing through the forest with sticks that measure, behave and look like modern javelins.</p>   <p>In the mid-1990s, a team of researchers in Germany led by Professor Hartmut Thieme <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/abs/385807a0.html">found a bunch of 400,000-year-old spears</a> buried in ancient mud. They were made of spruce, carefully carved, a little shorter than modern javelins, around seven feet instead of eight, but they are clearly meant to be thrown. Whoever made them, kept them wide close to the front for better lift.</p>   <div id="res157492084">

   <p>Replicas were made and given to some modern athletes, who threw them for fun and got them to fly for up to 70 meters — a very respectable distance. But the irony is, back in prehistoric days, when forest javelin throwers used them, they often added a little booster in the form of a leather thong, called an <a href="http://www.coloradomesa.edu/shared/facprofiles/documents/EfficacyoftheAnkyleinIncreasingtheDistanceofthe.pdf">ankyle</a>, that would set the javelin spinning, getting it to fly further.</p>      <p>Greek Olympians used this thong too, so their throws, presumably, were also enhanced, leaving me to think — and isn&#39;t this embarrassing? — that if we could invite a caveman or an original Olympian to watch modern men throw modern javelins, they&#39;d stand there, watch, see these sticks fly up, then down, and think ... what&#39;s their problem? We did it better.</p>   <p>That&#39;s a puzzlement. I understand the need for safety, but still — how must it feel to vie for a championship that in your heart of hearts you know won&#39;t measure up to those who&#39;ve gone before you?</p>   <p><strong>Best Ever?</strong></p>   <p>Lots of athletes come to the Olympics hoping to be the Best Ever. But not javelin throwers. They&#39;ve been told to dream smaller dreams (&#34;Best Since 1984!&#34;) and I think that&#39;s a bum deal.</p>   <p>Why not take this event away from crowded arenas, go someplace safe, design the best flying spear possible, throw it as far as you can, and then whoever breaks the record can say to all spear throwers going back over the ages, &#34;Now I&#39;m Number One, in the truest sense — mine flew further than all of yours!</p>   <p>That would be true Gold.</p>      <p><em>Professor Hartmut Thieme&#39;s co-authored paper on ancient throwing spears can be <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/abs/385807a0.html">found here</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Apps Getting Worse</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/07/Apps-Get-Worse</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Too often, a popular consumer app unexpectedly gets worse: Some combination of harder to use, missing
    features, and slower.  At a time in history where software is significantly eating the world, this is nonsensical. It’s also
    damaging to the lives of the people who depend on these products.</p>

<p>First, a few examples to clarify the kind of thing I’m talking about.  These are just the ones I’ve had personal experience
    with.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>iPain</span> · 
One super-obvious example is the long, sad story of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhoto">iPhoto</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMovie">iMovie</a>.</p>

<p>For years after the introduction of iMovie ’08, you could still get
    and use the ’06 version and lots of people did, because it was simple, straightforward, and the obvious things you needed to do
    were always within reach. I was using the program back then and since I’m a tech geek updated to the newest and greatest, then
    was reduced to inchoate screams of rage by ’08.  I couldn’t figure out how to do lots of obvious things, everything was klunky.
    There wasn’t a single dimension along which ’08 was better.</p>

<p>As for iPhoto, I never used it much, but my eighty-something mother did, and took lots of great photos with the Sony RX100 I
    gave her when I gave up on pocket cams. She’s not geeky but has a Bachelor’s in the sciences and is really smart. At some
    point they broke iPhoto so she couldn’t figure out how to do anything, and when she asked me for help she had tears in her
    eyes. I tried to get her fixed up, but she doesn’t take pictures much any more. I miss them.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span><cite>Economist</cite> pain</span> · 
I was still a Developer Advocate in the Android group when <cite>The Economist</cite> shipped their app.  I thought it had
    one of the best user experiences ever. You started at the beginning of the current issue, swiped down through an
    article to the bottom, then swapped to bring the next article in from the right. It remembered where you’d got to, which
    supports <cite>The Economist’s</cite> vision of being a weekly newspaper; one pass through and you’re caught up on the world
    that week.
    There was always a gesture to get to the Table of Contents, but I found I usually didn’t need it much, just swiped over the
    things I didn’t care about.
    I
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/08/11/Economist-App">praised it to the skies</a> at the time, and (admittedly) since
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/12/27/Columnar-Navigation">criticized its “Back” affordance</a>, but that was a minor gripe.</p>

<p>The most recent version has been fancified and crippled.  First of all, when you open the app, it doesn’t take you to where
    you were last reading. It insists on starting with “news of the day” (there are lots of other sites for that stuff) and you have
    to press “week” to get back into the actual publication. When you do that, even though it knows which articles you’ve read 
    (marking them with a check-mark in the table of contents) it maddeningly doesn’t take you to where you were last.  So you have
    to hunt through the table of contents to get yourself restarted.</p>

<p>And when you get to the bottom of an article, it doesn’t stop, it drops you into some weird bastardized section-specific
    table of contents thingie.  All I want is to flip down then flip right until I get to the damn end of the damn
    magazine. <em>Why?!</em></p>

<p id="p-3"><span>MLB</span> · 
I’ve used the Roku/MLB combo for years to watch ball games on our big TV.  The app has evolved over the years and mostly gotten better.  I find
    things on Roku tend to be a little sluggish, but MLB wasn’t too bad; it’d drop you, pretty quickly, into a screen containing a
    nice picture of a baseball stadium, then overlay a grid of games that were on; pick the one you want and away you go.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it’s become immensely slower, and apparently is spending that time trying to use some AI voodoo to figure out which
    game I’d like to watch.  After an endless delay, you get live video of the game it thinks you want to watch, with a few other
    games and menu choices overlaid around the edge. It’s reasonably good at guessing which game I want to watch, but way slower at
    getting me there than it used to be. When’s it’s (regularly) wrong, there are two (slow) menu transitions to get back to the
    grid of all the games.</p>

<p>Also, they screwed up the Android Auto app<span> —</span> I find listening to a game a good way to pass the
    time on the road.  It’s always had a flaw in that it tries to guess which game you want to watch and starts playing
    that<span> —</span> the guesses are laughably bad and I often end up with something like Miami Marlins in
    Spanish.  But, you were one tap away from a nice list of everything on offer.</p>

<p>Recently, the startup screen is trying be smarter, thus much slower, in presenting its guess as to what you might want to
    hear, with a few others (not all) offered as options. So I have to wait forever for this to manifest then hit a teeny little
    “More…” target to get the actual list of all the games on offer.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Why does this happen?</span> · 
It’s obvious.  Every high-tech company has people called “Product Managers” (PMs) whose job it is to work with customers and
    management and engineers to define what products should do.  No PM in history has ever said “This seems to be
    working pretty well, let’s leave it the way it is.” Because that’s not bold. That’s not visionary. That doesn’t get you
    promoted.</p>

<p>It is the dream of every PM to come up with a bold UX innovation that gets praise, and many believe the gospel that
    the software is better at figuring out what the customer wants than the customer is. And you get extra points these days for
    using ML.</p>

<p>Also, any time you make any change to a popular product, you’ve imposed a retraining cost on its users. Unfortunately,
    in their evaluations, PMs consider the cost of customer retraining time to be zero.</p>

<p>How to fix this?  Well, in my days at Amazon Web Services, I saw exactly zero instances of major service releases that, in
    the opinion of customers, crippled or broke the product. I’m not going to claim that our UX was generally excellent because it
    wasn’t; the fact that most users were geeks let us somewhat off the hook.</p>

<p>Why no breakage? Because these were Enterprise products,
    so the number of customers was orders of magnitude smaller than iAnything, so the PM could go talk to them and bounce
    improvement ideas off them. Customers are pretty good at spotting UX goofs in the making.</p>

<p>The evidence suggests that for mass-market products used by on the order of 10<sup>7</sup> people, it’s really difficult to
    predict which changes will be experienced as stupid, broken, and insulting.</p>

<p>Maybe we ought to start promoting PMs who are willing to stand pat for an occasional release or three.  Maybe we ought to
    fire all the consumer-product PMs.  Maybe we ought to start including realistic customer-retraining-cost estimates in our
    product planning process.</p>

<p>We need to stop breaking the software people use. Everyone deserves better.</p>

            <p>The Australian government has prepared a set of draft rules that requires the likes of social media companies to adhere to if they want to provide a service down under. </p><p>While failure to comply with reporting requirements could see the provider slapped with a AU$555,000 fine, the draft rules also build in encryption-busting expectations.</p><p>Australia&#39;s eSafety Commissioner from January will have sweeping new powers afforded to her under the <em>Online Safety Act 2020</em>. Such powers include oversight of new set of Basic Online Safety Expectations (BOSE) that sets out a series of demands for big tech.</p><p>These <a href="https://www.communications.gov.au/file/52396/download?token=g5mtd5WJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">expectations</a> [PDF] will apply to service providers including social media; &#34;relevant electronic service of any kind&#34;, such as messaging apps and games; and other designated internet services, such as websites.</p><p>Under the proposed<em> Draft Online Safety (Basic Online Safety Expectations) Determination 2021</em>, it is expected the provider would have to take reasonable steps to ensure safe use. This includes the &#34;core&#34; expectation that the provider of the service will take reasonable steps to ensure that end-users are able to use the service in a safe manner.</p><p>The provider is expected to minimise the availability of cyberbullying material targeted at an Australian child, cyber abuse material targeted at an Australian adult, a non-consensual intimate image of a person, class 1 material, material that promotes abhorrent violent conduct, material that incites abhorrent violent conduct, material that instructs in abhorrent violent conduct, and material that depicts abhorrent violent conduct.</p><p>The expectations also boast additional expectations, such as that the provider of the service will take reasonable steps to proactively minimise the extent to which material or activity on the service is or may be unlawful or harmful.</p>

    
<p>Reasonable steps that could be taken, the document said, could be through the development or implementation of processes to detect, moderate, report, and remove material or activity on the service that is or may be unlawful or harmful.</p><p>In the case of a service or a component of a service, such as an online app or game, that is used by children, the company must ensure the default privacy and safety settings are robust and set to the most restrictive level.</p><p>The draft BOSE also designate that those involved in providing the service, such as employees or contractors, are trained in, and are expected to implement and promote, online safety. The company must also continually improve safety in its tech and ensure that assessments of safety risks and impacts are undertaken, and safety review processes are implemented, throughout the design, development, deployment, and post-deployment stages for the service.</p><p>The rules, however, as currently drafted, mandate that if the service uses encryption, the provider of the service will take reasonable steps to develop and implement processes to detect and address material or activity on the service that is or may be unlawful or harmful.</p><p><strong>See also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-child-abuse-material-scanning-in-ios-15-draws-fire/">Apple child abuse material scanning in iOS 15 draws fire</a></strong></p><p>The government also wants providers to prevent anonymous accounts from being used to deal with material, or for activity, that is or may be unlawful or harmful.</p><p>It proposes the service could have processes that prevent the same person from repeatedly using anonymous accounts to post material, or to engage in activity, that is unlawful or harmful, and introduce the requirements to verify identity or ownership of accounts.</p><p>Australia&#39;s eSafety Commissioner will have the power to order tech companies to report on how they are responding to these harms and issue fines of up to AU$555,000 for companies and AU$111,000 for individuals if they don&#39;t respond.</p><p>Also provided under the legislative instrument are expectations regarding reports and complaints.</p><p>The provider of the service will be required to have clear and readily identifiable mechanisms that enable end-users to report and make complaints about material provided on the service. The companies will be required to keep records of complaints or reports for five years.</p><p>eSafety will be backed to receive information requests from providers within 30 days around complaints it has received, removal notice compliance, and measures the provider takes to make their space safe.</p><p>The provider would also be required to appoint a designated contact for the purpose of the Act.</p><p>The Bill allows the responsible minister, currently Paul Fletcher, to determine the details of these expectations by legislative instrument. The minister may also determine that the expectations apply to specific services.</p><p>As such, the government has prepared a <a href="https://www.communications.gov.au/file/52336/download?token=S0nlJI7G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">consultation paper</a> [PDF] and is accepting submissions until 15 October 2021.</p><h3>HERE&#39;S MORE</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-esafety-and-the-uphill-battle-of-regulating-the-ever-changing-online-realm/">Australia&#39;s eSafety and the uphill battle of regulating the ever-changing online realm</a></strong></p><p>The eSafety Commissioner has defended the Online Safety Act, saying it&#39;s about protecting the vulnerable and holding the social media platforms accountable for offering a safe product, much the same way as car manufacturers and food producers are in the offline world.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esafety-says-tweeting-her-wont-qualify-as-a-formal-request-under-online-safety-act/">eSafety says tweeting commissioner will not qualify as a formal Online Safety Act request</a></strong></p><p>The Office of the eSafety Commissioner has said the Twitter dispute that the incumbent has found herself in this week is part of the advice the office provides and that tagging the commissioner will not qualify as a formal request under the new Online Safety Act.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/protecting-women-in-the-cloud-esafety-hopes-the-online-safety-act-will-do-just-that/">Protecting women in the cloud: eSafety hopes the Online Safety Act will do just that</a></strong></p><p>The commissioner said a lot of online abuse is rooted in misogyny and intended to silence women&#39;s voices. She hopes the new Online Safety Act will go some way to prevent such abuse.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="u_0_2b_LW"><div id="u_0_2c_wE"><div tabindex="0" id="u_0_2d_05"><video muted="1" height="360" width="640" preload="metadata" data-video-width="640" data-video-height="360" id="u_0_2e_1I"></video><p></p><div><div><p>Something Went Wrong</p><p>We&#39;re having trouble playing this video.</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>The annals of science fiction are brimming with robots that perform tasks independently in the world, communicate fluently with people using natural language, and even improve themselves through these interactions. These machines do much more than follow preprogrammed instructions; they understand and engage with the real world much as people do.</p><p>Robots today can be programmed to vacuum the floor or perform a preset dance, but the gulf is vast between these machines and ones like Wall-E or R2-D2. This is largely because today’s robots don’t understand the world around them at a deep level. They can be programmed to back up when bumping into a chair, but they can’t recognize what a chair is or know that bumping into a spilled soda can will only make a bigger mess.</p><p>To help researchers and even hobbyists to build more intelligent real-world robots, we’ve created and have open-sourced the <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffacebookresearch%2Fdroidlet&amp;h=AT2WvRBvRrpxBTtVec64pHx3HHBNa2m01-8s-pTS4ZsidHYs8v09BE_Q_tFLJ_PSMdxiYadoAJ7vzvbyb3Xx-rQT_i8LDBz52bBqoZ8gQ0CEwqVaSMLav_0oe1SQnJf8KKJXLYQwjsgUwCHk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;}" data-lynx-mode="hover"><span>droidlet platform</span></a>.</p><p>Droidlet is a modular, heterogeneous embodied agent architecture, and a platform for building embodied agents, that sits at the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. It simplifies integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms in embodied systems and robotics to facilitate rapid prototyping.</p><p>People using droidlet can quickly test out different computer vision algorithms with their robot, for example, or replace one natural language understanding model with another. Droidlet enables researchers to easily build agents that can accomplish complex tasks either in the real world or in simulated environments like <i>Minecraft</i> or <i>Habitat</i>.</p><p>There is much more work to do — both in AI and in hardware engineering — before we will have robots that are even close to what we imagine in books, movies, and TV shows. But with droidlet, robotics researchers can now take advantage of the significant recent progress across the field of AI and build machines that can effectively respond to complex spoken commands like “pick up the blue tube next to the fuzzy chair that Bob is sitting in.” We look forward to seeing how the research community uses droidlet to advance this important field.</p><h2>A family of agents</h2><p>Rather than considering an agent as a monolith, we consider the droidlet agent to be made up of a collection of components, some of which are heuristic and some learned. As more researchers build with droidlet, they will improve its existing components and add new ones, which others in turn can then add to their own robotics projects. We believe this heterogenous design makes scaling tractable because it allows training on large data when large data is available for that component. It can also let programmers use sophisticated heuristics when they are available. The components can be trained with static data when convenient (e.g., a collection of labeled images for a vision component) or with dynamic data when appropriate (e.g., a grasping subroutine).</p><p>The high-level agent design consists of these interfaces between modules: </p><ul><li><p>A memory system acting as a nexus of information for all agent modules </p></li><li><p>A set of perceptual modules (e.g., object detection or pose estimation), that process information from the outside world and store it in memory </p></li><li><p>A set of lower-level tasks, such as “move three feet forward” and “place item in hand at given coordinates,” that can effect changes in the agent’s environment </p></li><li><p>A controller that decides which tasks to execute based on the state of the memory system </p></li></ul><p>Each of these modules can be further broken down into trainable or heuristic components.</p><p></p><p>This architecture also enables researchers to use the same intelligent agent on different robotic hardware by swapping out the tasks and the perceptual modules as needed by each robot&#39;s physical architecture and sensor requirements.</p><h2>Substantially reducing friction in integrating ML models</h2><p>The agent illustrated above demonstrates how to build with droidlet using specified components, but this is not the only way to use the library. The droidlet platform supports researchers building embodied agents more generally by reducing friction in integrating ML models and new capabilities, whether scripted or learned, into <i>their</i> systems, and by providing UX for human-agent interaction and data annotation. </p><p>The modules can all be used independent of the main agent, and the state-of-the-art perceptual modules may be of particular value to other researchers, given that current off-the-shelf models are poor for robotic use cases. In addition to the wrappers for connecting ML models to robots, we have model zoos for the various modules, including several vision models fine-tuned for the robot setting (for RGB and RGBD cameras).</p><p>Droidlet is bolstered by an interactive dashboard that researchers can use as an operational interface when building agents It includes debugging and visualization tools, as well as an interface for correcting agent errors on the fly or for crowdsourced annotation. As with the rest of the agent, the dashboard prioritizes modularity and makes it easy for researchers or hobbyists to add new widgets and tools.</p><h2>A powerful and flexible platform</h2><p>For researchers or hobbyists, droidlet offers <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2Fdev%2Fpeps%2Fpep-0206%2F%23id3&amp;h=AT33ELDzFwp5NZNrydP9vHIzlZ4U0d7NYAXkViDgnxazbKFvgWUg65KsTWd4FyUTPktWPy9jHPDU5xj7nskj6Bzd-2z8ZKKLD5owpTGWNz-aMr6HHbBL_MCuKrPqK3bDR2dXzXcWYtJM6KkP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;}" data-lynx-mode="hover"><span>batteries-included</span></a> agents that include primitives for visual perception and language, as well as a heuristic memory system and controller. Droidlet users can incorporate these modules into their robots or simulated agents by writing tasks that wrap primitives like “move to coordinate x, y, z.” These agents can perceive their environment via provided pretrained object detection and pose estimation models, and store their observations in the robot’s memory. Using this representation of the world around them, they can respond to language commands (e.g., “go to the red chair”), leveraging a pretrained neural semantic parser that converts natural language to programs.</p><p>Droidlet is also a flexible platform, and the ML modules and dashboards can be used outside the full agent. Over time, droidlet will become even more powerful as we add more tasks, sensory modalities, and hardware setups, and as other researchers and hobbyists build and contribute their own models.</p><p>Building intelligent machines that work in the real world is a fundamental scientific goal in AI. Facebook AI is helping the community by releasing not only droidlet and Habitat, but also other, independent research projects such as <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/near-perfect-point-goal-navigation-from-25-billion-frames-of-experience/" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;}"><span>DD-PPO</span></a>, our advanced point-goal navigation algorithm; <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/new-milestones-in-embodied-ai/" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;}"><span>SoundSpaces, our audio-visual platform for embodied AI</span></a>; and our simple <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/open-sourcing-pyrobot-to-accelerate-ai-robotics-research/" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;link&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;link&#34;}"><span>PyRobot framework.</span></a> The path is long to building robots with capabilities that approach those of people, but we believe that by sharing our research work with the AI community, all of us will get there faster.</p><a role="button" href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2101.10384.pdf&amp;h=AT0m_lMCjIi5Zpwo0qTaJaLoQcYbI-iqcYx-OWS6q1KC8KCDu4RTBg0RbVykzTsECEM9QFCz1rMfieQhmTKDm1i7jF9cERhluGVbROa_UOZbgDdqE-NdD8K1fRXu19PPPwnrhxrK3KNPY06y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-ms="{&#34;creative&#34;:&#34;button&#34;,&#34;creative_detail&#34;:&#34;button&#34;,&#34;create_type&#34;:&#34;button&#34;,&#34;create_type_detail&#34;:&#34;button&#34;}" data-lynx-mode="hover"><p>Read the paper</p></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p>Researchers investigating the submerged metropolis of <a href="https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/9/417416/Heritage/In-Photos-The-sunken-city-of-Th%C3%83%C2%B4nisHeracleion-in-A.aspx" target="_blank">Thônis-Heracleion</a>, in the Egyptian bay of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Abu-Qir-Bay" target="_blank">Abū Qīr</a>, have discovered wicker fruit baskets dated to the fourth century B.C.E.</p>




  

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    
  

  <p>Incredibly, the vessels still contain <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/doum-nut">doum nuts</a>—the fruit of an African palm tree considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians—and grape seeds.</p>




  

  <p>“Nothing was disturbed,” marine archaeologist <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/" target="_blank">Franck Goddio</a> tells Dalya Alberge of the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/02/fruit-baskets-from-fourth-century-bc-found-in-ruins-of-thonis-heracleion">Guardian.</a></em> “It was very striking to see baskets of fruits.”</p>




  

  <p>Goddio and his colleagues at the <a href="https://ieasm.institute/institute.php?lang=en" target="_blank">European Institute for Underwater Archaeology</a> (IEASM) uncovered the containers in collaboration with Egypt’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moantiquities/posts/179978074163747">Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities</a>. Researchers have been surveying the ancient Mediterranean port city of Thônis-Heracleion since its rediscovery in 2001, according to <em><a href="https://www.egyptindependent.com/photos-alexandrias-sunken-city-of-heracleion-reveals-new-treasures/" target="_blank">Egypt Independent</a>.</em></p>




  

  <p>The baskets were stored in an underground room and may have been funerary offerings, reports the <em><a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/08/02/ancient-greek-egyptian-thonis/">Greek City Times</a>. </em>Nearby, the researchers found a 197- by 26-foot <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Tumulus">tumulus</a>, or burial mound, and an extravagant array of Greek funerary goods likely left by merchants and mercenaries living in the area.</p>




  

  <p>“Everywhere we found evidence of burned material,” says Goddio in a statement, as quoted by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/thonis-heracleion-egypt-scli-intl-scn/index.html">CNN</a>’s Radina Gigova. “Spectacular ceremonies must have taken place there. The place must have been sealed for hundreds of years as we have found no objects from later than the early fourth century B.C.E., even though the city lived on for several hundred years after that.”</p>



  

  <p>Other objects found on or surrounding the tumulus included ancient pottery, bronze artifacts and figurines depicting the Egyptian god <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Osiris-Egyptian-god">Osiris</a>.</p>




  

  <p>“We found hundreds of deposits made of ceramic,” Goddio tells the <em>Guardian</em>. “One above the other. These are imported ceramic, red on black figures.”</p>




  

  <p>Thônis-Heracleion was founded around the eighth century B.C.E. According to Goddio’s <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html" target="_blank">website</a>, the city served as the “obligatory port of entry to Egypt for all ships coming from the Greek world” prior to the establishment of Alexandria around 331 B.C.E.</p>

  <p>The bustling trade hub reached its peak sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries B.C.E. Buildings radiated around a central temple, with a system of canals connecting different parts of the city. Homes and other religious structures stood on islands near the heart of Thônis-Heracleion.</p>




  

  <p>Once an epicenter for maritime commerce, the city <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/introduction.html">sank</a> into the Mediterranean in the eighth century C.E. Some historians attribute the metropolis’ downfall to rising sea levels and collapsing, unstable sediment, as Reg Little wrote for <em><a href="https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/11820878.oxford-university-rediscovery-lost-egyptian-city-heracleion/">Oxford Mail</a> </em>in 2015. Others posit that earthquakes and tidal waves caused a 42-square-mile segment of the Nile Delta to collapse into the sea, per CNN.</p>




  

  <p>As the <em><a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/british-museum-dips-its-toes-into-world-of-underwater-archaeology" target="_blank">Art Newspaper</a></em>’s Emily Sharpe reported in 2016, experts once thought that Heracleion—referenced by Greek historian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/17/nile-shipwreck-herodotus-archaeologists-thonis-heraclion" target="_blank">Herodotus</a> in the fifth century B.C.E.—was a separate city from Thônis, which is actually the site’s Egyptian name. A tablet found by Goddio’s team in 2001 helped researchers conclude that the two locations were one and the same.</p>




  

  <p>Recovering objects from the ruins of Thônis-Heracleion is a grueling task due to the layers of protective sediment covering them.</p>




  

  <p>“The goal is to learn as much as possible from our excavation without being intrusive,” Goddio told the <em>Art Newspaper</em> in 2016.</p>




  

  <p>Previous discoveries at Thônis-Heracleion include more than 700 ancient anchors, gold coins and weights, and dozens of tiny limestone sarcophagi containing the remains of mummified animals, according to <em>Oxford Mail. </em>Last month, archaeologists found a well-preserved, second-century B.C.E. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/divers-find-second-century-military-ship-sunken-egyptian-city-180978244/">military vessel</a> in a different part of the city.</p>




  

  <p>Experts expect to unearth more artifacts at the site in the future. Speaking with the <em>Guardian</em>, Goddio estimates that just 3 percent of the sunken city has been studied in the 20 years since its rediscovery.</p>

<h2>1. <strong>The Oldest Artwork Ever Found</strong></h2>



<p>In the late Eighties, twelve-year-old Bruno Kowalczewski was out hiking with his dad in Aveyron Valley, a forested region of steep gorges and rocky cliffs in southern France, when they were surprised to feel a faint breeze blowing out of the hillside from under ancient scree.</p>



<p>Bruno started clearing away the rocks to find out what was on the other side. After three years of digging, in February 1990, the Kowalczewskis and members of the local caving club broke through into a deep passageway that hadn’t been visited for a very long time. Stalactites drooped from the ceiling. Stalagmites clambered from the floor. They crept in, finding old animal bones, traces of bear activity, some pools of still water. And then, 1,102 feet inside the hill, they reached a place nobody like them had ever seen before; the passage opened into a chamber, and at its center there were two huge rings made up of hundreds of stalagmites. They’d been broken up deliberately, sometimes glazed in small fires, and arranged like the sign for infinity: ∞</p>



<p>The Kowalczewskis knew they’d found something extraordinary, and contacted archaeologist Francois Rouzaud, who, by carbon dating a burnt bear bone, suggested that the site was around 47,600 years old — so old that it was pushing the limits of carbon dating, which is only accurate up to 50,000 years. The rings they had discovered, one writer suggested, may have served as a map to the stars. But this age of revelations ended quickly, for in April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a nearby karstic network, Rouzaud had a heart attack and died. And with that, inquiry into the Bruniquel Cave came to an abrupt halt.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until recently — when Sophie Verheyden, an employee of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and a lifelong spelunker, happened to learn of the cave from an exhibition display at a nearby castle — that anyone explored the cave’s mysteries further. Verheyden wondered: why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites? She obtained permission to do so, and in 2013, found herself edging sideways through Bruno Kowalczewski’s tunnel. “I’m not very big,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/the-astonishing-age-of-a-neanderthal-cave-construction-site/484070/">she recalled</a>, “and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through. It’s kind of magical, even without the structures.” Verheyden and colleagues used uranium-series dating to more definitively place the rings at around 176,500 years old — around 130,000 years older than any cave painting yet discovered.</p>



<p>This meant that the rings couldn’t have been made by us, Homo sapiens, as we only arrived in Europe around 50,000 years ago; and that when we did finally make it there, we may have found its hidden places and shelters filled with aura by artworks already tens of thousands of years old. What Bruno Kowalczewski had discovered in this chamber-gallery under the hill was an early masterpiece by a Neanderthal Richard Serra, or Robert Smithson. A space of expression, or ritual, or both.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Our aesthetic sensibility derives from deep within our lineage.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Describing the cave in her recently published book, <em><a href="https://www.booklistonline.com/Kindred-Neanderthal-Life-Love-Death-and-Art-Rebecca-Wragg-Sykes/pid=9738153?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Kindred</a></em>, which synthesizes the latest findings on Neanderthals, Rebecca Wragg Sykes writes, “Monumental in scale and vision, it’s the first great art project, and at the same time truly weird, as in the original meaning of <em>wyrd</em>: destiny-changing power. Hominins might have made nothing like it for another 160,000 years, and the ‘why’ behind those stacked circles of burned stalagmites is lost in darkness.”</p>



<p>As <em>Kindred</em> shows, Neanderthal culture and ritual has only just begun to reveal itself. Thousands of generations ago, the forests rustled with Neanderthals, with European Homo heidelbergensis and antecessor, Indonesian Homo floresiensis — also known as the “hobbits” — Asian Homo luzonensis, African Homo naledi, rhodesiensis, ergaster, and other now-extinct human predecessors. Because they lived so long ago, and the details of their lives have been lost, we have long thought of these predecessors as primitive. But the Rings of Bruniquel suggest that, as far back as we can see, ancient human cultures have had some kind of desire for transcendence, a wish to leave their mark on the Earth; and that our aesthetic sensibility derives from deep within our lineage.</p>



<hr/>



<h2><strong>2. A Tale of Two Skulls</strong></h2>



<p>Bruniquel is an anomaly. So far, no other structures quite like it have turned up. Luckily, Neanderthals have left behind other far more subtle traces of their culture, offering clues to the sorts of relationships and societies they may have formed.</p>



<p>The most complete Neanderthal skeleton recovered to date was found in 1908, in Le Moustier, a town 80 miles from Bruniquel. As Wragg Sykes describes, Frenchman Jean Leysalles was digging up a rock shelter one afternoon when he hit a thick lower leg bone. He found more bones over the coming days, and eventually, one rainy evening, a shattered teenage skull: a boy, probably between 11 and 15 years, the same age Bruno Kowalczewski had been while clearing his tunnel. For decades, the Le Moustier 1 skeleton was on display at the Berlin Museum of Ethnography, but during the Second World War, its skull was hidden in a bunker in the Berlin Zoo, and later looted by the Red Army and carted off on a train to Moscow. The rest of the skeleton was left in the museum and blown up in a bombardment, and Le Moustier 1’s scattered parts were only reassembled in 1991, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But when he was put back together again, something about him became apparent, something that no one had noticed before.</p>



<p>We know from surviving photographs and diaries that the boy was found in an unusual, disordered configuration: his skull facedown and tilted back, and his lower jaw ajar, slightly detached, in a sort of expression of ecstasy. But modern analysis showed that his whole head was flayed, the flesh torn away, his tongue removed, his jaw cut off and possibly beaten. The flesh from his right femur had also been removed. His body parts, however, had not been scattered. His skull and jaw were found together, with his face pressed directly against a large flat stone, suggesting he may have been buried.</p>



<p>There’s no clear evidence that Le Moustier 1 was murdered — only that his head was butchered after death, while other body parts that would make a more obvious meal were not. Wragg Sykes suggests that these may have been signposts of a primitive funerary ritual. In <em>Kindred</em>, she compares this to the example of our close relatives, the bonobos, writing about family groups mourning: “In one situation, following a baby’s natural death the group spent an entire morning eating much of the body, before the mother carried away the remnants on her back.”</p>



<p>She goes on to cover the mysteries of other skeletal discoveries in great depth. The most complete Neanderthal skull, for example, was found at the 130,000-year-old archaeological site of Krapina, in Croatia. It’s marked with a row of 35 short, mostly parallel cuts, running over the forehead, toward the back of the skull. They don’t fit any known butchery pattern, nor have any equivalent patterns been found on other hominin skulls. But shorter sequences have been found at Neanderthal sites elsewhere: seven notches on a raven bone from Zaskalnaya, Crimea, and nine incisions, plus eight tiny dashes, on a hyaena bone from Les Pradelles, in Haute-Loire. These may be forms of primitive artwork, or perhaps an early form of communication. Whatever they signify, these 35 cuts are the longest sequence of Neanderthal code ever found.</p>


<div>
  <p>
  </p>
</div>



<p>Faint traces of symbols have also been revealed on animal remains. At various Neanderthal sites in southern Europe, archaeologists have found cut-off talons that may have been treasured as adornments or charms. Over a century ago, eight talons from white-tailed eagles — the largest eagle in Europe and most of Asia, with an eight-foot wingspan — were found in close proximity at Kaprina. In 2015, it was proposed that they were parts of a necklace. In 2020, a mixed pigment of red and yellow minerals, charcoal, and clay was detected on one of these talons, meaning that it had once been painted. Like the Rings of Bruniquel, this necklace suggests that ancient humans also engaged in symbolic activities, and may have been dressing up and decorating their bodies to express their status or identity.</p>



<p>White-tailed eagles are awe-inspiring hunters that dominated the skies of ancient Europe, and their talons may have been coveted because they were hard to obtain, or fearsomely beautiful, or perhaps because they were thought to confer certain favors or powers. The discovery that the longest known sequence of Neanderthal markings appears etched into the Kaprina skull likewise implies that skulls were valued, whether for ritualistic reasons or as trophies or memento mori — or for some other reason beyond our imagination. Collectively, these fragments suggest Neanderthal lives, like our own, involved art and ritual, and the maintenance of complex relationships, both personal and sexual, with one another. Unlike modern humans, however, they also would have had the opportunity to meet and interact with other hominins.</p>

<h2><strong>3. The Cave at the Edge of the World</strong></h2>



<p>The story of human evolution may be riddled with mystery, but we do know for sure that different species of humans once roamed the world simultaneously — and that many of these populations crossed paths. The evidence isn’t found in cultural artifacts or sites  — we have yet to find any intra-hominin collaborative art works  —  but rather in the story told by ancient DNA.</p>



<p>In 2010, Svante Pääbo, director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, led a team that <a href="https://www.mpg.de/13894984/neandertal-genome-project">mapped out</a> the Neanderthal genome using DNA from their bone fragments. He discovered evidence that they must have interbred with Homo sapiens: all non-African populations contain some Neanderthal DNA, up to two or three percent, because after leaving sub-Saharan Africa, our ancestors met and had children with Neanderthals during at least three, and perhaps up to half-a-dozen, distinct periods.</p>



<p>That same year, Pääbo and his colleagues also <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100324/full/464472a.html">uncovered</a> something unexpected in a small fragment of toe, recovered from Denisova Cave in Russia’s Altai Mountains, which was known to have been frequented by Neanderthals. In this genome, the researchers found an entirely new “ghost” population of ancient humans: the Denisovans, about whom still very little is known. The Denisovans are thought to have spread across East Asia, and to have had an unusual ability to survive at high altitudes. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2198349-we-may-have-bred-with-denisovans-much-more-recently-than-we-thought/">Genetic analysis</a> has shown that many Chinese and South-East Asians have a small amount of Denisovan in them, and that up to five percent of Aboriginal Australians and six percent of New Guinean DNA is Denisovan. Before they disappeared, they were having sex with us.</p>



<p>An even more surprising fragment of bone was collected in the same cave in 2012, and later found to be Neanderthal: a part of a limb of a young teenage girl who lived about 90,000 years ago. In 2018, further <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06004-0#:~:text=This%20cave%20lends%20its%20name,were%20also%20home%20to%20Neanderthals.">genetic analysis</a> revealed that while her mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) came from a Neanderthal mother, her nuclear DNA showed that her father had been a Denisovan. She was nicknamed Denny. Given that only a couple hundred Neanderthals have ever been found, and the entire Denisovan fossil record would fit inside a box of American Spirits, this little girl disproved prior assumptions about our ancestry. Denny’s discovery is so rare, the researchers didn’t initially believe it. “The implications are staggering,” Wragg Sykes writes. “It was assumed that interbreeding was rare, and direct evidence would only ever lurk in the genetic gloom, many generations back from the bones we study. Actually finding the child of a union between different kinds of hominin implies it can’t have been that uncommon.” Furthermore, studies of her Denisovan father’s genes have also turned up shards of Neanderthal DNA. This means that interbreeding had also taken place many generations before her birth, and perhaps in the same cave; such were the telenovela lives of the ancient humans.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>This is just one of many examples of how sexual choices made tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago in faraway caves can dramatically affect our lives today.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Denisova cave lies on the eastern boundary of the Neanderthals’ homelands, which reached from North Wales down to the fringes of the Arabian deserts and across to China. These mountains of what is now Russia were the western boundary of the Denisovans’ range. No Neanderthal DNA has ever been found farther east, and no Denisovan farther west. “Perhaps,” Wragg Sykes writes, “this cave was literally at the edge of their two worlds.” They may well have traveled from far away before passing through the same cave, at the same time, by accident or design: Denny’s mother’s mtDNA shows she was more closely related to Neanderthals found thousands of miles away in Croatia than to others found in Denisova, in the very same cave. While we’ll never know in what circumstances children like Denny were conceived, we can tell they were raised and cared for — otherwise they would not have survived into adolescence, and would not have been able to carry on the lines we now trace in our own genomes.</p>



<p>The genes that we’ve inherited from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and likely other populations besides, have both helped and hindered us. A particular Denisovan gene, for instance, helps Tibetans to cope with low oxygen levels high up in the Himalayas. Every incarnation of the Dalai Llama will have carried a lot of Denisovan DNA. Neanderthal genes have been linked to weight gain and addiction; and while these are no longer desirable traits today, gluttony would once have helped with thermal efficiency and staving off starvation. Last fall, during the pandemic, a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3">research project</a> led by Svante Pääbo and his colleague Hugo Zeberg identified two Neanderthal “haplotypes,” or sets of DNA variations, that affect our bodies’ response to Covid-19. One, found on the 3rd of our 46 chromosomes, doubles the likelihood of needing intensive care if infected with the coronavirus. It’s thought to encode a protein that helps the Sars-CoV-2 virus hijack cells, and to be involved in the production of cytokine signaling proteins that regulate the immune system. Another Neanderthal haplotype, found on the 12th chromosome, appears to lower the chance of serious illness by a fifth. This is just one of many examples of how sexual choices made tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago in faraway caves can dramatically affect our lives today.</p>



<hr/>



<h2>4. <strong>The Valley of Life</strong></h2>



<p>In the Neandertal (Neander Valley), a limestone region of Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, in the mid-19th century, a group of unusual hominin fossils was found in a quarry. Soon afterwards, the local natural historian Johann Carl Fuhlrott and the anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen declared that these bones must have come from a vanished human species. It was 1859, the same year that Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace announced their theories of natural selection. Darwin himself, the following decade, would hold a Neanderthal skull in his hands. All we know of his response is that he found it “wonderful.” He always preferred to remain reticent on the question of human evolution. But today, 21st-century genetics allow us to peer through time in ways not possible before. Like tribes of Neanderthal artists building rings lit by flames in the caves, we can draw maps of our spiraling helixes and how they’ve evolved over time, in search of what we are, and how we came to be.</p>



<p>We still have much in common, it seems, with Neanderthals. The Rings of Bruniquel suggest a shared desire for transcendent expression. The skulls from Le Moustier and Kaprina may reveal a wish to be remembered, and perhaps to honor the dead; they could also be read as signs of our enduring cruelty to our fellow man. But it’s clear that we share a drive to explore as much of the world as possible, whether journeying across the vast, harsh landscapes of Pleistocene Europe, or tracking the ghosts in our blood through long sequences of numbers on a screen. That so much of our Neanderthal and Denisovan lineage has been uncovered in less than a decade, and from so few fossils, suggests there was much more interbreeding — and many more hybrid beings — than we may ever know. Imagine what else hides inside of us, just waiting to be discovered.</p>

      <title>Stupidity is a specific cognitive failing</title>
      <link>https://psyche.co/ideas/why-some-of-the-smartest-people-can-be-so-very-stupid</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___psyche_co_ideas_why-some-of-the-smartest-people-can-be-so-very-stupid/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>A few years before</strong> he died in exile from Nazism, the Austrian novelist Robert Musil delivered a lecture in Vienna, ‘On Stupidity’ (1937). At its heart was the idea that stupidity was not mere ‘dumbness’, not a brute lack of processing power. Dumbness, for Musil, was ‘straightforward’, indeed almost ‘honourable’. Stupidity was something very different and much more dangerous: dangerous precisely because some of the smartest people, the least dumb, were often the most stupid.</p>
<p>Musil’s lecture bequeaths us an important set of questions. What exactly is stupidity? How does it relate to morality: can you be morally good and stupid, for example? How does it relate to vice: is stupidity a kind of prejudice, perhaps? And why is it so domain-specific: why are people often stupid in one area and insightful in another? Musil’s own answer, which centred around pretentiousness, is too focused on the dilettantism of interwar Vienna to serve us now. But his questions, and his intuition about stupidity’s danger, are as relevant as ever.</p>
<p>Stupidity is a very specific cognitive failing. Crudely put, it occurs when you don’t have the right conceptual tools for the job. The result is an inability to make sense of what is happening and a resulting tendency to force phenomena into crude, distorting pigeonholes.</p>
<p>This is easiest to introduce with a tragic case. British high command during the First World War frequently understood trench warfare using concepts and strategies from the cavalry battles of their youth. As one of Field Marshal Douglas Haig’s subordinates later remarked, they thought of the trenches as ‘mobile operations at the halt’: ie, as fluid battle lines with the simple caveat that nothing in fact budged for years. Unsurprisingly, this did not serve them well in formulating a strategy: they were hampered, beyond the shortage of material resources, by a kind of ‘conceptual obsolescence’, a failure to update their cognitive tools to fit the task in hand.</p>
<p>In at least some cases, intelligence actively abets stupidity by allowing pernicious rationalisation</p>
<p>Stupidity will often arise in cases like this, when an outdated conceptual framework is forced into service, mangling the user’s grip on some new phenomenon. It is important to distinguish this from mere <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/our-epistemic-crisis-is-essentially-ethical-and-so-are-its-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">error</a>. We make mistakes for all kinds of reasons. Stupidity is rather one specific and stubborn cause of error. Historically, philosophers have worried a great deal about the irrationality of not taking the available means to my goals: Tom wants to get fit, yet his running shoes are quietly gathering dust. The stock solution to Tom’s quandary is simple willpower. Stupidity is very different from this. It is rather a lack of the necessary means, a lack of the necessary intellectual equipment. Combatting it will typically require not brute willpower but the construction of a new way of seeing our self and our world.</p>
<p>Such stupidity is perfectly compatible with intelligence: Haig was by any standard a smart man. Indeed, in at least some cases, intelligence actively abets stupidity by allowing pernicious rationalisation: when Harry Houdini, the great illusionist, took Arthur Conan Doyle, the inventor of Sherlock Holmes, through the tricks underlying the seances in which Conan Doyle devoutly believed, the author’s reaction was to concoct a ludicrously elaborate counter-explanation as to why it was precisely the true mediums who would appear to be frauds.</p>
<p><strong>While I have introduced it</strong> via ‘conceptual obsolescence’, stupidity is also compatible with a kind of misguided innovation. Consider a country that excitedly imports new conceptual tools not from a past time but from a very different place. Global debates over social justice, for example, are now dominated by a set of ideas and terms taken from the United States, a nation marked by an incredibly specific historical and cultural trajectory. Simply transferring that framework to other countries, such as those in which class is less starkly racialised (for example, states reliant on exploiting white migrant labour from eastern Europe), or in which it is racialised in much more complex ways (for example, states such as South Africa) is conceptually and socially risky.</p>
<p>Stupidity has two features that make it particularly dangerous when compared with other vices. First, unlike character flaws, stupidity is primarily a property of groups or traditions, not individuals: after all, we get most of our concepts, our mental tools, from the society we are raised in. Suppose the problem with Haig had been laziness: there was no shortage of energetic generals to replace him. But if Haig worked himself to the bone within the intellectual prison of the 19th-century military tradition, then solving the difficulty becomes harder: you will need to introduce a new conceptual framework and establish a sense of identity and military pride for it. Once stupidity has taken hold of a group or society, it is thus particularly hard to eradicate – inventing, distributing and normalising new concepts is tough work.</p>
<p>Dumbness alone is rarely the driving threat: at the head of almost every dumb movement, you will find the stupid in charge</p>
<p>Second, stupidity begets more stupidity due to a profound ambiguity in its nature. If stupidity is a matter of the wrong tools for the job, whether an action is stupid will depend on what the job is; just as a hammer is perfect for some tasks and wrong for others. Take politics, where stupidity is particularly catching: a stupid slogan chimes with a stupid voter, it mirrors the way they see the world. The result is that stupidity can, ironically, be extremely effective in the right environment: a kind of incapacity is in effect being selected for. It is vital to separate this point from familiar and condescending claims about how dumb or uneducated the ‘other side’ are: stupidity is compatible with high educational achievement, and it is more the property of a political culture than of the individuals in it, needing to be tackled at that level.</p>
<p>Musil’s indulgent, almost patrician, attitude to ‘honourable’ dumbness was certainly dangerously complacent: consider its role in the anti-vax phenomenon. But dumbness alone is rarely the driving threat: at the head of almost every dumb movement, you will find the stupid in charge.</p>
<p>We can now explain why stupidity is so domain-specific, why someone can be so smart in one area, and such an idiot in another: the relevant concepts are often domain-specific. Furthermore, we can see that there will be many cases that aren’t fully fledged stupidity but that mimic its effects. Imagine someone who had been blind to all evidence that they were being cheated on finally asking themselves ‘How could you be so stupid?’ Here the problem is not pure stupidity: the concept of a cheat is common enough. What we have here is rather someone ‘acting as if they were stupid’. It’s not just that they failed to apply the concept of betrayal, but that they literally didn’t think of it: it was effectively ‘offline’, due to emotional and other pressures. In this kind of case, agents possess the necessary intellectual tools but unwittingly lock them away. This marks an important contrast with dumbness – we can make ourselves stupid, but we don’t make ourselves dumb.</p>
<p>So stupidity is tough to fix. This is exacerbated by the way it dovetails with other vices: stubbornness stops me from revisiting my concepts even as they fail me. But once we understand stupidity’s nature, things are a little brighter than they might seem. To view political opponents as primarily cynical transforms them into Machiavellian monsters, leaving no space for anything but a zero-sum battle for domination. To view political opponents as primarily dumb is to suggest an irreparable flaw – one that, in our deeply hierarchical society, we often project on to those without the ‘right’ educational credentials. Both moves also offer a certain false reassurance: with a bit of reflection, we can be fairly sure that we are not cynical and, with the right credentials, we can prove that we are not dumb. But we might well, nevertheless, be caught in the net of stupidity. If history is anything to go by, a few hundred years from now, our ancestors will find at least one part of contemporary morality almost unintelligible – ‘How could decent people ever have believed that?’ If they are not to condemn us as evil, they might well have to conclude that we were stupid.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-key="article"><p>Facebook has shut down the personal accounts of a pair of New York University researchers and shuttered their investigation into misinformation spread through political ads on the social network.</p><p>Facebook says the researchers violated its terms of service and were involved in unauthorized data collection from its massive network. The academics, however, say the company is attempting to exert control on research that paints it in a negative light. </p><p>The NYU researchers with the Ad Observatory Project had for several years been looking into Facebook’s Ad Library, where searches can be done on advertisements running across Facebook’s products. </p><p>The access was used to “uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, to identify misinformation in political ads, including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation,” said Laura Edelson, the lead researcher behind NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy, <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/researchers-nyu-knight-institute-condemn-facebooks-effort-to-squelch-independent-research-about-misinformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a statement</a><!-- -->. </p><p>Facebook’s action against the NYU project also cut off other researchers and journalists who got access to Facebook data through the project, Edelson said.</p><p>The researchers offered Facebook users a web browser plug-in tool that let them volunteer their data showing how the social network targets political ads. </p><p>But Facebook said the browser extension was programmed to evade its detection systems and vacuum up user data, creating privacy concerns.</p><p>In <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a><!-- --> late Tuesday, Facebook said it takes “unauthorized data scraping seriously, and when we find instances of scraping we investigate and take action to protect our platform.”</p><p>Facebook sent a cease-and-desist letter to Edelson and another researcher, Damon McCoy, in October but didn’t shut down their accounts until Tuesday, hours after Edelson informed the platform that she and McCoy were studying the spread of disinformation on the platform about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the researchers said. </p><p>Mike Clark, Facebook product management director, wrote in the blog post that the Menlo Park, California, company welcomes research that holds it accountable but that doesn’t compromise the security of the platform or users’ privacy.</p><p>“While the Ad Observatory project may be well-intentioned, the ongoing and continued violations of protections against scraping cannot be ignored and should be remediated,” he wrote.</p><p>At least two Democratic senators expressed concerns about Facebook’s move. Mark Warner of Virginia said tech platforms should “work with, and better empower, independent researchers” but instead the company has “seemingly done the opposite.” Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she was troubled by Facebook cutting off researcher access to political advertising data, “which has shown that the company continues to sell millions of dollars’ worth of political ads without proper disclosures.” </p><p>Facebook says it makes information on political ads available through its Ad Library and provides “privacy-protected data sets” to researchers through other means. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Their calls were initially seen as “by-catch” on bat detectors, and generally considered a bit of a problem. But five years ago, Stuart Newson from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) started tuning out of the bat noises and into mammal noises, most of which hadn’t been described before. “It was a bit of an eye-opener of how varied they are,” he says.</p><p>Newson started collecting a library of sounds and then built software that could identify them. Often sounds are quick, and it isn’t until they are slowed down that their complexity is revealed. He has been leading an 18-month project to create “acoustic classifiers” for small mammals for the first time.</p><figure id="ba85cf26-ec3d-4740-b517-a4d6b67f43c7"><div></div></figure><p>Mammals produce a lot less sound than bats: a recorder left out for a week might have 800,000 bat calls and only 100 small mammal calls.</p><figure id="43935eeb-6339-444e-9c1f-135c1c04c422"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-11 | 11" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></figure><p>It is hard work picking out the calls. Dense vegetation distorts the sound waves reaching the microphone. Both humans and classifiers (which use algorithms) can struggle to detect calls when there is other noise around.</p><p>“If we were in a nightclub, and you’re over by the loos and I’m by the entrance, and you’re shouting at me, I can see that you’re trying to communicate something to me but I can’t make out what you’re saying because there is too much other noise around,” says Pearce. “This happens when doing recordings in woodland habitats. The goal is to design a methodology that will overcome these problems so that we collect the very best acoustic data.”</p><figure id="e9bdc192-1a7f-4792-9618-5aa261cfc161"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=853ac826ffde9462cd06c9fc42a53769 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e25cc8576804fc4d3b1ad4279a46104e 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=54783a056d6c04ac5b2eadc17ad0904c 890w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d14fa00a0229cfc132cd2e0fd405814a 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8bf774a9de7d65098d27e33f257d7f22 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f47780621174e77115091c5f0a118e1208f04/0_175_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0e371b69a1596347de6d1b3e6253fde5 445w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Huma Pearce goes through the data picking out noise patterns that could come from small mammals.</span> Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Researchers are in the process of creating an extensive library of sounds because hundreds, or even thousands, of recordings will be needed for the algorithm to work well.</p><p>In Lesnes Abbey Wood, Pearce has been using a bat detector called a Song Meter Mini, which costs £700 and can record constantly for three weeks using four AA batteries. She goes through the data picking out noise patterns that could come from small mammals, and compares these sounds to what she has caught in her human traps. Detectors can pick up calls from up to 10 metres away, depending on the animal.</p><p>For Ian Holt, estate manager at Lesnes Abbey Wood, this information is valuable because it helps him protect habitats, apply for grants and encourage more visitors. “The first thing to know is what you’ve got; if you don’t know what you’ve got you can’t manage it. Also if you want to impress upon people the importance of the wood, you can say, ‘we’ve got this, we’ve got that’,” he says.</p><figure id="8fea9051-8e6f-4807-992b-6fd772f7c2db"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f353ae60e7244b88add6db6bec5ef599 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=191568f346e1744f51a6a20326d9e3b1 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=49a77462e64d83476206118782b1ac87 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=d7fe6b295eedb66fd2ad1201bc458233 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=bb23947d975bf47627f4444f94418e10 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=35d7dc56de5a07e2bb250785b3acd9ae 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=820cdc8c130a2526d2185bc102e96834 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=785665dbb9ad038626cafea85eb0e624 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8c86edb376399344c93a2a80352ffb5a 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f4da750cd17430d9cc70a6ab816b4fd60ac569/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9a7faf148c50c53e64cf94a11c9cdfe3 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>The recent development of cheaper and improved bat detectors means researchers are able to collect more sound data.</span> Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The recent development of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/30/new-sensor-offers-a-window-into-the-secret-lives-of-britain-rarest-bats-aoe" data-link-name="in body link">cheaper and improved bat detectors</a>, such as £60 Audiomoth sensors, means there is a lot more sound data starting to come from landscapes. Most people extract bat calls from hypersonic recordings and dump the rest of it, says Pearce. “I’m now contacting bat groups and asking for their stationary acoustic data to try to find out how often and which species of small mammals are also recorded,” she says. Eventually Pearce wants to put acoustic recorders across London to build a complete map of small mammals in the capital.</p><p>At the moment it’s hard to monitor elusive small mammals without trapping them, and many landscapes are lacking data on small mammals. Acoustic identification could be an important non-interventionist way of recording their populations, which very often go undetected. Using acoustics could help monitor populations of rodents on seabird islands, for instance, which could then be followed up with more intensive surveying.</p><p>Newson has been contacted by people in other European countries who want to record mammals. “I think there could be benefits much more widely than the UK. I hope it will be a catalyst for people to think about acoustic potential,” he says. “I’m really confident the equipment will get cheaper, and as it becomes cheaper, it’ll become a lot more accessible.”</p><p><em>Find more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction" data-link-name="in body link">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href="https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en" data-link-name="in body link">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en" data-link-name="in body link">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, these sellers aren’t <em>supposed </em>to be able to email their Amazon customers directly, and <!-- -->doing so outside of Amazon’s official channels violates the platform’s terms of service. </p><p>However, a concerning new <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-amazon-customers-leave-negative-reviews-some-sellers-hunt-them-down-11628420400&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-amazon-customers-leave-negative-reviews-some-sellers-hunt-them-down-11628420400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a></span> report shows that some sellers are still finding ways to get in touch with buyers and hound them about editing or deleting their negative reviews, and some companies even offer “email extraction” and “reviewer lookup” services so sellers can hunt down unsatisfied customers. </p><p>One such customer the Journal spoke with is New Yorker Katherine Scott, who said she left a negative review for a kitchen oil spray bottle that she bought in March after the product didn’t work as advertised. A week later, someone claiming to be a customer service rep from the seller reached out via email to offer her a refund in exchange for deleting her review. </p><p>“We are willing to refund in full. When we do not receive a response, we will assume that you did not see it, and will continue to send emails,” the message read via the Journal. It concluded with a plea: “We hope you can reconsider deleting comments at your convenience okay?”</p><p>When Scott asked for a refund but refused to take down her review, she received an email from another representative offering her $20, double what she paid for the product, to delete it. She received several more unwanted emails over the next few months, all pestering her to take her review down.</p><div><div data-inset-url="http://sunday-scaries.n72aat.net/BXz1W1" data-inset-category="CommerceInsetMobile"><p>G/O Media may get a commission</p></div></div><p> “It was so creepy. They emailed me directly about it over and over,” Scott told the outlet. </p><p>At least a dozen other customer reviews for similar products mentioned that the seller reached out and pressured them to revise their negative review. “Product doesn’t work and company will bother you till you change review,” one customer wrote, the Journal reports. “Seller offers $20-$30 to delete negative reviews,” said another.</p><p>Another Amazon customer, Ben Hendin of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told the outlet that a seller reached out to him four times after he left a negative review of a finger splint. To try to convince him to delete the review, the seller kept upping the refund amount, eventually reaching $40, more than double what the splint cost.</p><p>When it comes to sharing information with third-party sellers, Amazon only releases “customers’ personal information related to those transactions with that third party,” according to its <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Commerce&#34;,&#34;gizmodo - Here&amp;#39;s How Amazon Third-Party Sellers Reportedly Hound Customers Who Leave Bad Reviews&#34;,&#34;&#34;]]" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ascsubtag=3b3c149ddd26f07e93a5938b1750d8c4d16aaf6e&amp;nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ&amp;tag=gizmodoamzn-20#GUID-8966E75F-9B92-4A2B-BFD5-967D57513A40__SECTION_467C686A137847768F44B619694D3F7C" target="_blank" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="gizmodoamzn-20" data-amazonsubtag="[t|link[p|1847446648[au|5876237249238959473[b|gizmodo[lt|text">privacy<!-- --> notice</a></span>.<strong> </strong>Qualified sellers have the option of using Amazon’s buyer-seller messaging service, but that uses a unique <!-- -->encrypted email address<!-- --> rather than the customer’s personal email. </p><p>“We do not share customer email addresses with third-party sellers,” an Amazon spokesperson told Journal.</p><p>Amazon’s <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Commerce&#34;,&#34;gizmodo - Here&amp;#39;s How Amazon Third-Party Sellers Reportedly Hound Customers Who Leave Bad Reviews&#34;,&#34;&#34;]]" href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/GYRKB5RU3FS5TURN?ascsubtag=3b3c149ddd26f07e93a5938b1750d8c4d16aaf6e&amp;language=en_US&amp;tag=gizmodoamzn-20" target="_blank" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="gizmodoamzn-20" data-amazonsubtag="[t|link[p|1847446648[au|5876237249238959473[b|gizmodo[lt|text">customer product review policies</a></span> for sellers explicitly prohibit them from asking a customer to change or remove their review. Sellers are also banned from offering “a refund or other compensation” to a reviewer in exchange for editing their review. </p><p>As for how the seller got her email address, Scott told the Journal she had a theory. Her Amazon package came with a “free gift” insert for a cooking thermometer that prompted her to enter her email address and order ID, she said. This kind of insert is also against Amazon’s policies, a company spokesperson told the Journal. Hendin said he asked the seller directly about how they got his contact information, to which the representative reportedly replied: “Boss found it through social software search for names.”</p><p>There’s apparently enough demand from sellers that companies have begun offering services explicitly dedicated to finding contact info for unsatisfied customers. One company the Journal investigated, Matic Chain, reportedly offers an “email extraction service for Amazon sellers.” A company representative told the outlet that it combs through Google and social media to match a buyer’s name with their contact information.</p><p>Another company that offers similar services, ZonBoost, openly boasts about it on its website. As screenshotted below, it advertises a “Reviewer Lookup” tool where, for just $60 a pop, you can plug in the link to the Amazon review and ZonBoost promises to “find you those buyers’ name &amp; personal email with 100% accuracy!” (Technically it’s 60 “credits,” but each credit costs one dollar.) </p><figure data-id="34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5" data-recommend-id="image://34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5" data-format="png" data-width="2862" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Image for article titled Here&amp;#39;s How Amazon Third-Party Sellers Reportedly Hound Customers Who Leave Bad Reviews" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,pg_1,q_80,w_80/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 80w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_140/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 140w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_265/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 265w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_340/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 340w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_490/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 490w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_645/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 645w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_740/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 740w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_965/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 965w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1165/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 1165w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1315/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 1315w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1465/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 1465w, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1600/34609c79a5f58aa9e637c56f1eff29e5.png 1600w" sizes="
