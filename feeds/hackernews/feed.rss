      <title>Open Question: How Can We Fix Files?</title>
      <link>https://www.schroer.ca/2021/08/05/file-browsers/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I was recently helping my mother share a file using Microsoft Sharepoint. The file was a zip archive containing a few word documents. We uploaded the file and sent a share link to the recipient. They clicked the link and was unable to use the files. It turned out that rather than downloading the file, the link opens an online file browser that navigates into the zip. This caused confusion because the the user did not understand that a online view of the files is not the same as having the files on your computer.</p>
<p>This is common in the world of online files. So I started to wonder: <strong>How can we build software that does not continuously confuse people?</strong></p>
<p>Context matters. If you open a folder on your computer, it is different than opening it in a web browser interface and it is different than opening it on your phone. In computers a lot depends on context. Files are a great example of this. They are a building block of modern computing and there are many different contexts where people work with files.</p>
<p>The file browser view is iconic to our industry. Anyone who has used a computer with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) knows what a file browser looks like. It looks the same as it did in classic Windows, with a list of files in the centre and often some common folders on the left. Any place that you find files, you will eventually encounter a file browser that looks familiar.</p>
<p>While they look the same, they do not act the same. Some file browsers can create, edit and save files. Some can only show them. Some can only work with certain types of files. Some wont even show the correct list. This is often a platform limitation. To do something with a file. users need to move the files from one file browser to a different one. To a user this is confusing.</p>
<p>Is it a bad thing that we have so many different browsers? Are there ways to simplify and streamline this fragmented system? I think its important to look at these questions since every new file browser and every new context makes it harder for people to know how it all should work. It silos our users and keeps them within a smaller ecosystem.</p>

   <p>A couple of weeks ago, Edgar Dworsky walked into a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store in Somerville, Mass., like a detective entering a murder scene. </p>   <p>He stepped into the cereal aisle, where he hoped to find the smoking gun. He scanned the shelves. Oh no, he thought. He was too late. The store had already replaced old General Mills cereal boxes — such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs — with newer ones. It was as though the suspect&#39;s fingerprints had been wiped clean.</p>   <p>Then Dworsky headed toward the back of the store. Sure enough, old boxes of Cocoa Puffs and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios were stacked at the end of one of the aisles. He grabbed an old box of Cocoa Puffs and put it side by side with the new one. Aha! The tip he had received was right on the money. General Mills had downsized the contents of its &#34;family size&#34; boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces. </p>   <p>Dworsky went to the checkout aisle, and both boxes — gasp! — were the same price. It was an open-and-shut case: General Mills is yet another perpetrator of &#34;shrinkflation.&#34;</p>      <div id="res1012410291">

   <h3>Downsizing and shrinkflation mean the same thing</h3>   <p>Dworsky is a former Massachusetts assistant attorney general and longtime consumer advocate. He has spent decades tracking instances of companies shrinking products on his website <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432979f03f664d49dcc5e5c79f39a18dd28b4271efc31369b940439b84ef03106dbcaf749cb0c4b65cddf8ad9f5779632f">Mouseprint</a>. He refers to it by its original name, downsizing, but economist Pippa Malmgren rechristened it &#34;shrinkflation&#34; about a decade ago, and the term stuck. Downsizing and shrinkflation both refer to the same thing: companies reducing the size or quantity of their products while charging the same price or even more.</p>   <p>&#34;Downsizing is really a sneaky price increase,&#34; Dworsky says. &#34;Consumers tend to be price conscious. But they&#39;re not net-weight conscious. They can tell instantly if they&#39;re used to paying $2.99 for a carton of orange juice and that goes up to $3.19. But if the orange juice container goes from 64 ounces to 59 ounces, they&#39;re probably not going to notice.&#34;</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor&#39;s note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>&#39;s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>   <p>If consumers were the rational creatures depicted in classic economic theory, they would notice shrinkflation. They would keep their eyes on the price per Cocoa Puff and not fall for gimmicks in how companies package those Cocoa Puffs. A <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431bda99a81a3e11ccaa9d0a3100c38f5fce925be8af2571a53314c2a5241140d144dd2a80d4a3d73f92a9c5ce53a3b7a8">study</a> by John T. Gourville and Jonathan J. Koehler analyzed data from the market for cereal and other sectors and found that consumers are much more gullible than classic theory predicts. They are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity. Companies, of course, have known this for years.</p>      <h3>The case of the shrinking toilet paper roll</h3>   <p>Back in the day, Dworsky says, he remembers buying bigger candy bars and bigger rolls of toilet paper. The original Charmin roll of toilet paper, he says, had <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074380bdb227e78c01698090ddf0cd7729dde6a63e0f63ec19f02c2726185ba8f8ef8871b7fe92c8264edb806abb7712740b">650 sheets</a>. Now you have to pay extra for &#34;Mega Rolls&#34; and &#34;Super Mega Rolls&#34; — and even those have many fewer sheets than the original. To add insult to injury, Charmin recently <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507436430d5921dd0eb3903b2624508e06d573d78c79c31a38a42d205f2db8be79b17c97dce8733c2adb9a32af3dadb13b309">shrank the size</a> of their toilet sheets. Talk about a crappy deal.</p>   <p>Shrinkflation, or downsizing, is probably as old as mass consumerism. Over the years, Dworsky has documented the downsizing of everything from Doritos to baby shampoo to ranch dressing. &#34;The downsizing tends to happen when manufacturers face some type of pricing pressure,&#34; he says. For example, if the price of gasoline or grain goes up.</p>   <p>That is why, when the government began reporting surges in inflation several months ago, Dworsky was on the lookout for its devious, shrinkifying cousin. We&#39;re now seeing a wave of shrinkflation, from <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb0650743229b1d1113e35515b00072bd3d30004d4181b17d3a73d24aa2e22b551c0ae1af34db14311eacdaa89aed18e52aa23e71">Tillamook ice cream</a> to <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431e1f4f0280b3498124614ee117ed5303c3e2d79c0d7bd2e407ce14d19838c96f8dfeffe564bee25d18866e5c810739bb">Royal Canin cat food</a>. &#34;As we&#39;re seeing inflation picking up now, that&#39;s why I think you&#39;re going to see more items being downsized,&#34; Dworksy says. &#34;And maybe it&#39;s going to be a double-whammy: We&#39;re going to see some products going up in price at the same time that you&#39;re actually getting less in the package.&#34;</p>   <h3>A taller cereal box does not always mean more cereal</h3>   <p>Not all consumers are oblivious to shrinkflation. </p>   <p>Jonathan Fitzer is a big fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, another cereal made by General Mills. A couple of weeks ago, he went to a local grocery store in Tampa, Fla., to re-up. But on the shelf were two different versions of the product. The old box was the same as always.

   <p>Last week, <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432b19006ec32478bb0ef7e1247060a85e399c5a1c4cb8b79bef504ee8cb0910db43548194adaed454d041e5aebc72be01">General Mills announced</a> the rising cost of ingredients, packaging, labor, and trucking was forcing it to revamp its business. It said that it was taking &#34;pricing actions&#34; and other steps to grapple with this inflation. We reached out to General Mills about reports that it&#39;s downsizing its cereals as part of its strategy.</p>   <p>&#34;General Mills has been working to create consistency and standardization across our cereal products, making it easier for shoppers to distinguish between sizes on shelf. For consumers seeking the best price per ounce, the most value is normally in our larger boxes of cereal,&#34; says Kelsey Roemhildt, a General Mills spokesperson. &#34;This change also allows more efficient truck loading leading to fewer trucks on the road and fewer gallons of fuel used, which is important in both reducing global emissions as well as offsetting increased costs associated with inflation.&#34;</p>   <p>General Mills&#39; reframing of its shrinkflation seems to be pretty typical of Corporate America. Companies often sell downsizing as a way to help the environment, offer consumers more choice, or improve the quality of their products. When a spokesperson for Charmin, for example, was confronted by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074353590c90100e375352895576ae8d747bdf88b7848805445710e057dc19de67a4c2010405c4fb5d464678205f59a5ca49">reporters at WBUR</a> about shrinking the size of their toilet sheet squares, she suggested it was the result of &#34;innovations&#34; that allow consumers to, basically, wipe their butts more efficiently.</p>   <p>If this keeps up, maybe someday we&#39;ll all be living in a Lilliputian dystopia where we&#39;re forced to eat miniature candy bars, drink tiny drinks, and wipe our bottoms with teeny-tiny squares of paper. Or maybe consumers will start to notice and voice concern and the power of consumer demand will force companies to listen and right-size their products. Until then, our prayers are with the lovers of Cocoa Puffs.</p>   <p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter segment? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a rel="noopener" href="https://eric-landau.medium.com/?source=post_page-----fd8fbe98e99b--------------------------------"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="d674"><em>The purpose of this post is to introduce the “micro-model” methodology we use at </em><a href="http://cord.tech" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>Cord</em></a><em> to automate data annotation. We have deployed this approach on computer vision labelling tasks across a wide range of domains including medical imaging, agriculture, autonomous vehicles, and satellite imaging.</em></p><p id="c187"><strong>TLDR;</strong> <strong>What</strong>: Low bias models applied to a small domain of a data distribution. <strong>How</strong>: Overfitting deep learning models on a handful of examples of a narrowly defined task. <strong>Why</strong>: Saving hundreds of hours of hand labelling.</p><p id="35d3"><em>How much data do you need to build a model that detects Batman?</em></p><figure><p></p><figcaption>Dark Knight vision</figcaption></figure><p id="69a6">This o<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">f</span></span> course depends on your goal. Maybe you want a general purpose model that can detect the Batmen of Adam West, Michael Keaton, and Batfleck all in one. Maybe you need it to include a Bruce Wayne detector that can also identify the man behind the mask.</p><p id="5f21">But if you want a model that follows the Christian Bale Batman in one movie, in one scene, the answer is…<strong>five labelled images</strong>. The model used to produce the snippet of model inference results above was trained with the five labels below:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="9f6e">Now, does this answer the initial question? This model is only a <em>partial</em> Batman model. It doesn’t perform that well on the Val Kilmer or George Clooney Batmen, but it is still functional with a specific use case. We thus won’t call it a Batman model, but instead a Batman <strong>micro-model</strong>.</p><p id="a77f"><strong>Origins</strong></p><p id="d04c">We started using micro-models in the early days of Cord when our focus was purely on video data. We stumbled upon the idea when trying out different modelling frameworks to automate the classification of gastroenterology videos (you can find more about that <a rel="noopener" href="https://eric-landau.medium.com/pain-relief-for-doctors-labelling-data-72f3e5e31c92">here</a>). Our initial strategy was to try a “classical” data science approach of sampling frames from a wide distribution of videos, training a model, and then testing on out-of-sample images of a different set of videos. We would then use these models and measure our annotation efficiency improvement compared to human labelling. We realized in experiments, however, that a classification model trained on a small set of intelligently selected frames from <em>only one</em> video already produced strong results. We also noticed that as we turned the number of epochs up, our annotation efficiencies got higher.</p><p id="ce36">This was contrary to what we knew about good data science; we were grossly overfitting a model to this video. But it worked, especially if we broke it up such that each video had its own model. We called them micro-models. While this was for video frame classification, we have since extended the practice to include tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation.</p><p id="821f"><strong>What are micro-models exactly?</strong></p><p id="f0ed">Most succinctly, <strong>micro-models are annotation specific models that are overtrained to a particular task or particular piece of data</strong>. They are <em>purposefully</em> overfit models such that they don’t perform well on general problems, but are very effective in automating one aspect of your data annotation. They are thus designed to only be good at one thing. To use them in practice, we ensemble many together to automate a comprehensive annotation process.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div></figure><p id="6b8c">The distinction between a “traditional” model and a micro-model is not in their architecture or parameters, but in their domain of application, the counter-intuitive data science practices that are used to produce them, and their eventual end uses.</p><p id="04ac"><strong>1-dimensional labelling</strong></p><p id="9bd2">To cover <em>how</em> micro-models work, we will take a highly simplified toy model that can give a clearer insight into the underpinnings beneath them. Machine learning at its core is curve-fitting, just in a very high dimensional space with many parameters. It is thus instructive to distill the essence of building a model to one of the simplest possible cases, one-dimensional labelling. <strong>The following is <em>slightly</em> more technical, feel free to skip ahead.</strong></p><p id="8760">Imagine you are an AI company with the following problem:</p><ul><li id="9424"><em>You need to build a model that fits the hypothetical curve below</em></li><li id="e1d2"><em>You don’t have the x-y coordinates of the curve and can’t actually see the curve as a whole, you can only manually sample values of x and for each one you have to look up the corresponding y value associated with it (the “label” for x).</em></li><li id="6d17"><em>Due to this “labelling” operation, each sample comes with a cost</em></li></ul><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="920b">You want to fit the whole curve with one model, but it is too expensive to densely sample points to do so. What strategies can you use here?</p><p id="a425">One strategy is fitting a high degree polynomial to some initial set of sampled points across the domain of the curve, re-sampling at random , evaluating the error, and updating the polynomial as necessary. The issue is that you will have to re-fit the whole curve each time new sample points are checked. Every point will affect every other. Your model will also have to be quite complex to handle all the different variations in the curve.</p><p id="8ea9">Another strategy, which resolves these problems, is to sample in a local region, fit a model that approximates just that region, and then stitch together many of these local regions over the entire domain. We can try to fit a model to just this curved piece below for instance:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="1b78">This is <em>spline interpolation</em>, a common technique for curve-fitting. Each spline is purposefully “overfit” to a local region. It will not extrapolate well beyond its domain, but it doesn’t have to. This is the conceptual basis for micro-models, manifested in a low dimensional space. These individual spline units are analogous to “micro-models” that we are using to automate our x-value labelling.</p><p id="6545">The more general case follows similar core logic with some additional subtleties(like utilizing transfer learning and optimizing sampling strategies). To automate a full computer vision annotation process, we also “stitch” micro-models together like an assembly line. Note, ensembling weak models together to achieve better inference results is an idea that has been around for a long time. This is slightly different. We are not averaging micro-models together for a single prediction, we let each one handle predictions on their own. Micro-models are also not just “weak learners.” They just have limited coverage over a data distribution and exhibit <strong>very low bias</strong> over that coverage.</p><p id="9893">We are leveraging the fact that during an annotation process, we have access to some form of human supervision to “point” the models to the correct domain. This guidance over the domain of the micro-model allows us to get away with using very few human labels to start automating a process.</p><p id="ff84"><strong>Batman Efficiency</strong></p><p id="5b8b">Models can be defined based on <em>form </em>(a quantifiable representation approximating some phenomena in the world) or on <em>function </em>(a tool that helps you do stuff). My view leans toward the latter. As the common quote goes:</p><blockquote><p id="92ee">All models are wrong, but some are useful.</p></blockquote><p id="73a2">Micro-models are no different. Their justification flows from using them in applications along a variety of domains.</p><p id="fe28">To consider the practical considerations of micro-models with regards to annotation, let’s look at our Batman example. Taking fifteen hundred frames from the scene we trained our model on, we see that Batman is present in about half of them. Our micro-model in turn picks up about 70% of these instances. We thus get around <strong>five hundred</strong> Batman labels from only <strong>five</strong> manual annotations.</p><p id="75de">There are of course issues of correction. We have false positives for instance. Consider the inference result of one of the “faux” Batmen from the scene that our model picks up on.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>I’m (not) Batman</figcaption></figure><p id="8656">We also have bounding boxes that are not as tight as they could be. This is all, however, with just the first pass of our micro-model. Like normal models, micro-models will go through a few rounds of iteration. For this, active learning is the best solution.</p><p id="0ed3">We only started with five labels, but now with some minimal correction and smart sampling, we have more than five hundred labels to work with to train the next generation of our micro-model. We then use this more powerful version to improve on our original inference results and produce higher quality labels. After another loop of this process, when accounting for number of human actions, including manual corrections, our Batman label efficiency with our micro-model gets to over 95%.</p><p id="42af"><strong>Added Benefits</strong></p><p id="7cd5">There are some additional points to consider in evaluating micro-models:</p><ol><li id="1efc"><strong>Time to get started</strong>: You can start using micro-models in inference within five minutes of a new project due to requiring so few labels to train.</li><li id="aedd"><strong>Iteration time</strong>: A corollary to the speed of getting started is the short iteration cycle. You can get into active learning loops that are minutes long rather than hours or days.</li><li id="5911"><strong>Prototyping: </strong>Short iteration cycles facilitate rapid model experimentation. We have seen micro-models serve as very useful prototypes for the future production models people are building. They are quick checks if ideas are minimally feasible for an ML project.</li></ol><p id="8020"><strong>Data-oriented Programming</strong></p><p id="c249">While we have found success in using micro-models for data annotation, we think there is also a realm of possibility beyond just data pipeline applications. As mentioned before, AI is curve fitting. But even more fundamentally, it is getting a computer to do something you want it to do, which is simply programming. It is just a form of programming that is statistically rather than logically driven.</p><p id="f7f6">“Normal” programming works by establishing deterministic contingencies for the transformation of inputs to outputs via logical operations. Machine learning thrives in high complexity domains where the difficulty in logically capturing these contingencies is supplanted by learning from examples. This <em>statistical</em> programming paradigm is still in its infancy and hasn’t developed the conceptual frameworks around it for robust practical use yet.</p><p id="0d9c">For example, factorization of problems into smaller components is one of the key elements to most problem solving frameworks. The object oriented programming paradigm was an organziational shift in this direction that accelerated the development of software engineering and is still in practice today. We are still in the early days of AI, and perhaps instantiating a <strong><em>data-oriented programming</em> </strong>paradigm is necessary for similar rapid progression.</p><p id="c30b">In this context, micro-models might have a natural analogue in the object paradigm. One lump in a complex data distribution is an “object equivalent” with the micro-model being an instantiation of that object. While these ideas are still early, they coincide well with the new emphasis on <em>data-centric AI</em>. Developing the tools to orchestrate these “data objects” is the burden for the next generation of AI infrastructure. We are only getting started, and still have a long way to go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>17th-century botanists filled their gardens with plants from around the world</title>
      <link>https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/contribute-either-usefulness-or-delight</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>The English naturalist Mark Catesby (1683–1749) began his 1731 <em>Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands</em> with a clear statement about his early vocation to study natural history: “The early inclination I had to search after plants, and other productions in nature, being much suppressed by my residing too far from London, the center of all science, I was deprived of all opportunities and examples to excite me to a stronger pursuit after those things to which I was bent.” What led Catesby to state that London was “the center of all science”?</p>
<p>In 1687, four years after Catesby’s birth, <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a> had published his <em>Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica</em> (<em>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</em>); and in 1703, when Catesby was twenty, Newton was elected president of the Royal Society of London, founded in 1660 “for improving natural knowledge.” Newton was to hold this position until his death in 1727. Under him, the Royal Society was to lead the intellectual quest for gaining knowledge based on empirical observation, experiment, and verification rather than on classical authority.</p>
<p>Naming and classifying new species for the evergrowing catalogue of nature was one aspect of “improving natural knowledge.” The aim of achieving scientific comprehensiveness existed side by side with the urge to collect rare natural objects and identify commodities for potential mechanical and medicinal use. To these various ends, members of the Royal Society and other wealthy individuals sponsored plant collectors and explorers to travel to America, Africa, and the Near and Far East to collect new material which could then be added to the “philosophical stock” or “general bank” of experimental learning. The material collected was incorporated into collectors’ cabinets, used for medicine and for commercial gain from colonial enterprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Royal Society published detailed instructions about the phenomena travelers were encouraged to observe. Robert Boyle wrote a treatise entitled <em>General Heads for the Natural History of a Country, Great or Small; Drawn Out for the Use of Travelers and Navigators, in Which Information Was to Be Sought Under the Headings of Mineral, Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms</em>. The apothecary James Petiver in his <em>Musei Petiveriani</em> (1695) directed collectors to follow Boyle’s instructions. The prose style in which the findings of collectors should be recorded was also specified, the Royal Society “preferring the language of artisans, countrymen, and merchants before that of wits or scholars.” The aim was that observations recorded in collectors’ accounts and journals, together with specimens, should provide scientists with a new corpus of objective data on which to build a scientific explanation of the physical universe. Some of this data was published in the Royal Society’s <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, and some in books written by the collectors themselves.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>reeminent among the academic botanists attempting to catalogue the enormous number of new species arriving from foreign parts, and to incorporate them (with cumbersome Latin polynomials) into a taxonomy, was William Sherard, known as “the Maecenas of botany” by his contemporaries. After studying law at Oxford, Sherard made three grand tours on the Continent as a traveling companion and tutor, where he came into contact with two of the most distinguished Continental botanists—Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in Paris and Paul Hermann, professor of botany at Leiden. He also traveled and collected plants in Italy, and spent a fifteen-year period in Turkey as British Consul in Smyrna, where he studied and collected the plants of Asia Minor. At his death, he left funds for the founding of the first chair in botany at Oxford, named after him. His magnum opus—his so-called Pinax—was an attempt to “to publish an account of the world’s plants” by updating the list of six thousand plants included by the Swiss botanist Caspar Bauhin in his 1623 <em>Pinax theatri botanici</em> (Catalogue of the theater of plants), with every known species discovered since then. Left unfinished at his death, the ambitious project was taken over by Sherard’s German protégé, Johann Jakob Dillenius, who likewise left it unfinished. The “Pinax” survives as an unpublished manuscript in the Department of Plant Sciences at Oxford, a resonant symbol of the belief that it was possible to make an exhaustive catalogue of the world’s known plants.</p>
<p>Plants were sent from foreign parts in the form of the <em>hortus siccus</em> (literally, dried garden) of preserved, pressed specimens which could then be studied and compared with other specimens in collectors’ herbaria. A labeled herbarium was the essential tool for serious eighteenth-century botanists, “providing a link between a plant’s identity and the evidence of its occurrence at a particular point in time and space.” Live plants in barrels of soil and seeds were also sent by collectors, and these, once propagated, became part of the botanical garden or <em>hortus vivus</em> (living garden). Some of these gardens were kept by naturalists for the purpose of studying rare plants. Others were more specifically for growing medicinal plants.</p>
<p>One of the most famous of these dedicated physic gardens was that of the Society of Apothecaries—the Chelsea Physic Garden—founded in 1673 for the purpose of training apprentice apothecaries to study the medicinal plants grown there; the plants or simples from the garden were then processed in the laboratories in the Apothecaries’ Hall at Blackfriars. From 1722 the Apothecaries were required to supply fifty herbarium specimens a year to the Royal Society, and during this period, under the direction of Philip Miller (1722–70), their garden became the most renowned physic garden in Britain and a “pivot of horticultural debate and plant dissemination.” Plants sent from all over the world were grown in the Chelsea garden, and in its turn, it exchanged seeds with other physic gardens such as the equally famous Hortus Botanicus at Leiden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1728, under Philip Miller, a group of the most prominent nursery gardeners based in and around London joined together to form a Society of Gardeners; in 1730 they published the first volume of their <em>Catalogus plantarum, or</em> <em>A Catalogue of Trees, Shrubs, Plants, and Flowers Both Exotic and Domestic Which Are Propagated for Sale in the Gardens near London</em>. Their stated purpose was “to promote the introducing among us such foreign trees, as may contribute either to usefulness or delight,” with the aim also to bring order into plant nomenclature.</p>
<p>Many private owners—both in and outside London—likewise had gardens of rare plants in which new discoveries were prized. One such garden owner was William Sherard’s brother, James, also a botanist, and an apothecary who had made a fortune from his London practice. His garden at Eltham, Kent, then a small village around nine miles outside London, included hothouses for exotics and became renowned as one of the finest in England for rare and valuable plants, containing “many species new to science or little known and never before illustrated.”</p>
<p>The Duchess of Beaufort’s garden at Badminton, Gloucestershire, was another private garden renowned for its rarities grown using newly developed hothouses. The duchess, Mary Somerset, was a serious, self-trained botanist who assembled over a quarter of a century (until her death in 1714) an enormous geographical range of plants, both in her garden and in the twelve volumes of her herbarium. Live plants and dried specimens, which she identified from her extensive library of botanical works, came from as far afield as the West Indies, Africa, India, Sri Lanka, China, and Japan. The duchess employed William Sherard as a tutor to her grandson, no doubt so that she could benefit from his botanical expertise.</p>
<p>The Quaker merchant and botanist Peter Collinson (1694–1768) was responsible for introducing many new plants into cultivation in his gardens, which became celebrated for their American exotics. His first garden was at his house at Peckham, then a small hamlet south of London; from 1749, he spent two years transplanting his trees and shrubs into what was to become a more famous garden at Ridge House, Mill Hill, Middlesex, a property inherited from his father-in-law. Its contents were later to be catalogued in <em>Hortus Collinsonianus</em>, drawn up from unpublished lists Collinson had begun in 1722. A nineteenth-century biographer was to write, “Natural history in all its parts, planting, and horticulture were his delight. He cultivated the choicest exotics and the rarest English plants. His garden contained, at one time, a more complete assortment of the <em>Orchis genus</em> than, perhaps, had ever been seen in one collection before.” Equally known as a promoter of botany and a friend of everyone in the horticultural world, Collinson himself was to record late in life: “I often stand with wonder and amazement when I view the inconceivable variety of flowers, shrubs, and trees now in our gardens and what there were forty years ago; in that time what quantities from all North America have annually been collected by my means of procuring.”</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he 8th Baron, Lord Petre, was at the forefront of the new taste in landscape gardening, to which <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/pope" target="_blank">Alexander Pope</a> was a major influence, both in his poetry and prose and in the example of the garden he created with Charles Bridgeman at Twickenham. Pope’s line “First follow Nature and your Judgment frame” pointed the way to a more natural and “painterly” style to replace the formal taste for geometrical and architectural framing of nature. As part of the new school of gardening, “amphitheaters” of evergreens were created to balance “wilderness” plantations and open parkland, and straight lines replaced by serpentine shapes and vistas on to rolling landscapes. Petre was perhaps the most ambitious of the nobleman garden enthusiasts, and his garden at Thorndon Park in Essex became renowned for its rare trees and shrubs and stoves (heated greenhouses) for tropical plants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>North American shrubs and trees were supplied by the nursery trade and collectors. In addition, Collinson established a scheme whereby John Bartram, a Quaker farmer in Philadelphia, supplied seeds and seedlings at five guineas a box to wealthy English garden owners. As Collinson observed, “The present excellent taste of the nobility and gentry to embellish their plantations with all the variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers which are produced in our North American colonies has given great encouragement to the annual importation of plants and seeds which arrive here in the spring months.” Collinson recorded that Petre “planted out forty thousand of all kinds of trees to embellish the woods at the head of the park on each side of the avenue to the lodge and round the esplanade…His stoves exceed in dimensions all others in Europe.”</p>
<p>When Petre died of smallpox in 1742 aged twenty-nine, Collinson wrote to Linnaeus that his death was “the greatest loss that botany or gardening ever felt in this island,” adding that “he spared no pains nor expense to procure seeds and plants from all parts of the world, and then was as ambitious to preserve them.”</p>
<p>Collections of rare plants in gardens were complemented by collections of rarities of all sorts indoors. The Royal Society had a repository from soon after its foundation. Many of the objects were displayed in a room lined with cabinets, fitted with drawers below for small objects such as fossils and shells, and glazed above to display the larger items on shelves, including varnished “animal parts” and mounted animal skeletons. Members were allowed to borrow items, but the repository suffered from the lack of a curator, and its contents fell into a state of disrepair. When Zacharias von Uffenbach saw it during his visit to London in 1710, he noted: “Hardly a thing is to be recognized, so wretched do they all look.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 id="what-is-saml">What is SAML?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and
authorization data between parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>SAML is often used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single-sign on</a>
(“Sign in with Google”, “Sign in with Twitter” etc.).
It means when you want to log in to example.com, example.com
can trust &amp; use an external authentication provider to <em>assert</em> the user’s identity for you. SAML
is about communicating these authentication &amp; identity details across organization boundaries (web domains).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Update: although Google <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519">supports SAML</a> use cases,
Google/Facebook primarily use OAuth2 for these “Sign in with Google” general public authentication flows.
It was my bad for not clarifying that I used these more of <em>example of what Single-sign on means</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h2>
<p>SAML is used in so many places, it probably affects your security too.</p>
<p><a href="https://mattermost.com/blog/securing-xml-implementations-across-the-web/">SAML has recently had catastrophic vulnerabilities</a>
with a really large impact.
For example, if I understood correctly
(I probably did, since the security researcher retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/joonas_fi/status/1420717822716661762">my reaction</a>)
the Finnish tax authority, most government services and health record systems were vulnerable in such
a way that an attacker could have gone on to snoop people’s tax returns, health records and basically
anything government-related that is available online.</p>
<p>It’s been largely ignored by the media, perhaps because the vulnerabilities weren’t taken
advantage of (or instances of such weren’t detected).</p>
<h2 id="why-is-saml-insecure">Why is SAML insecure?</h2>
<p>SAML uses signatures based on computed values.
The practice is inherently insecure and thus SAML as a design is insecure.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-signing-computed-values-dangerous">Why is signing computed values dangerous?</h2>
<p>In summary: once you base your security on some computed property, you can now exploit any flaws,
differences or ambiguity in this computation. The more complex the computation is, the more dangerous it gets.
SAML signature computation is pretty fucking complex.</p>
<p>But let’s move on to explain the concept. Let’s take a pseudo identity document (actual SAML is XML though):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json
{
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>We can sign<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the above file just as a bunch of bytes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json | sha1sum
e58dc03a7491f9e5fb2ed664b23d826489c42cc5
</code></pre><p>Now if we change the file just a little (I added space before the <code>{</code>).
We notice that the signature changes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json
 {
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}
$ cat assertion.json | sha1sum
0bc80a9ee02f611b70319c9fe12b7e504107354a
</code></pre><p>This is a very good property, because ideally we want any changes (even those considered meaningless
at JSON level) to the security-critical document (which SAML is) to <strong>produce different signatures</strong>.</p>
<p>This property is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">non-malleability</a>.
<a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/malleability"><em>Malleability</em> generic definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the quality of something that can be shaped into something else without breaking, like the malleability of clay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Us signing the document as a raw byte blob makes this non-malleable, i.e. it can’t be shaped without
breaking it. That’s a desired behaviour in information security.</p>
<p>SAML is malleable because its signatures are based on computed values:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Signature over</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Raw content is malleable</th>
<th>Security</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Raw bytes</td>
<td>File or message raw content</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>👍</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Computed values</td>
<td>Parsed XML tree content</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>👎</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To explain by example, let’s get back to the JSON example. We’ll use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>
(a JSON transformation utility) to <em>compute</em> something from inside our document:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json
 {
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}

$ cat assertion.json | jq .
{
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>(<code>jq .</code> means just re-print the whole document)</p>
<p>Notice how piping the file through <code>jq</code> removed the space?
That’s because at JSON level the space is not important.
At first sight this doesn’t seem interesting, but we’re heading to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E">danger zone</a> and fast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let’s sign the computed value:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json | jq . | sha1sum
e58dc03a7491f9e5fb2ed664b23d826489c42cc5
</code></pre><p>Even though the file still has the space modification, the signature now matches the original
signature (from the file that didn’t have the space added).</p>
<p>Why’s this dangerous?
Let’s change the file again:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ cat assertion.json
{
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;EvilAttacker&#34;,
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}

$ cat assertion.json | jq . | sha1sum
e58dc03a7491f9e5fb2ed664b23d826489c42cc5

# the above is because:

$ cat assertion.json | jq .
{
  &#34;signed_in_user&#34;: &#34;Joonas&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>The signature still matches the original file.
This is because <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21833017">duplicate keys are valid JSON</a>, removed upon
processing and most JSON implementations let the last key win.</p>
<p>Now what happens if you have two different pieces of code that process the SAML document and they have
different interpretations/parser behaviour regarding JSON duplicate keys (= message semantic content)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>An attacker asked the identity provider to sign an assertion for him, but due to SAML malleability he
was able to attack parser differences and tamper the document to still be valid for signature validation
but access data for a different user.</p>
<p>Now I have hopefully explained how malleability and basing signatures on computed / interpreted content
is dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="the-saml-vulnerability-in-practice">The SAML vulnerability in practice</h2>
<p>It is not as straightforward as our JSON example what happened with these SAML vulnerabilities, but
this illustrates the principle of these vulnerabilities and their root cause: signing computed values
and malleability.</p>
<p>The latest vulnerabilities were due to
<a href="https://mattermost.com/blog/securing-xml-implementations-across-the-web/">XML round-trip instability</a>
(see heading “What an XML round-trip vulnerability looks like”).</p>
<p>In summary the vulnerability arises from when parsing XML -&gt; writing XML produces semantically
different document, i.e. <code>encode(decode(xmlDocument)) != xmlDocument</code>).</p>
<p>I’m not 100 % sure but I think since the SAML signature validation needs a XML write step, it went
something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The above would not be an an attack vector if SAML content-to-be-signed was non-malleable, i.e. any change
after the identity provider signs the document would be detected as a signature violation.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-saml-this-way">Why is SAML this way?</h2>
<p>Let’s assume in good faith that the SAML designers knew non-malleability is a good property to have
and let’s try to guess why they still ended up with a malleable design.</p>
<p>So, let’s sign something. When one signs something, one get a signature as output: <code>sign(contentToSign, signingKey) -&gt; signature</code>.</p>
<p>For the signature to be useful, you need to transport the <code>signature</code> along with <code>contentToSign</code> so
that when a consumer reads <code>contentToSign</code> they can verify it with the <code>signature</code>.</p>
<p>Sending this alone would have been easy to keep non-malleable:</p>
<pre><code>contentToSign
</code></pre><p>But <code>signature</code> is missing. SAML designers probably didn’t want to transport the SAML document and
its signature separately (the signature possibly in a HTTP header or URL parameter), so for
convenience they wanted to embed it in the same XML document:</p>
<pre><code>samlDocument
├── contentToSign
└── signature
</code></pre><p>To be more technically correct, it gets even more YOLO than that. The signature is stored under
<code>contentToSign</code>, so upon the validation process the signature needs to be ignored (<a href="https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/blob/6f318b2f18251aa66983056c1db7e4eef312103c/validate.go#L252">again more
dangerous complexity</a>)
to not actually include it in <code>contentToSign</code> which would make it an impossible recursive problem:</p>
<pre><code>samlDocument
└── contentToSign
    └── signature
</code></pre><p>But let’s imagine the previous simpler case where the <code>signature</code> was <strong>not</strong> stored inside <code>contentToSign</code>
and get back to the question if we could’ve made signature validation byte-based!</p>
<p>The problem is that it is really hard to extract the bytes belonging to <code>contentToSign</code> from inside
the XML message. XML parser APIs to my knowledge don’t support this use case. Even if some would, for
SAML to be useful they had to cater to what most XML parser implementations support.</p>
<p>=&gt; When you have <code>samlDocument</code> and you’d want to access its sub-tree <code>contentToSign</code>, you only get
XML-level access there, so SAML designers probably didn’t think much of it, went 🤷‍♂️ and said
“let’s sign XML-level data then”.</p>
<p>Signing output of an XML parser is really hard, because you’re trying to keep signature input stable
from XML parsing output that has parser differences from XML library to library and from language to
language.
So that’s why we have <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">XML dsig</a> which has rules for e.g. sorting
XML attributes in
<a href="https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/blob/3541f5e554eefd0d2ef501e27544650d62bf5d22/etreeutils/sort.go#L58">some clusterfuck order</a>
in order for SAML implementations to reach some kind of stable consensus on which byte sequence to validate
the signature against.
In the end we always need to match on bytes anyway.
This craziness is known as <em>canonicalization</em> and it transforms something like this this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;Example</span>   <span>foo=</span><span>&#34;hello&#34;</span>        <span>bar=</span><span>&#34;hehehe&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;Item&gt;</span>    mooo<span>&lt;/Item  &gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/Example&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Into bytes like this (so signature input is stable):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;Example</span> <span>bar=</span><span>&#34;hehehe&#34;</span> <span>foo=</span><span>&#34;hello&#34;</span><span>&gt;&lt;Item&gt;</span>mooo<span>&lt;/Item&gt;&lt;/Example&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>(This is just an example I invented, I’m not sure which rules actually exist
<a href="https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/blob/3541f5e554eefd0d2ef501e27544650d62bf5d22/canonicalize_test.go#L19">but here are some examples</a>.)</p>
<p>Summary: XML sub-trees are hard to sign/validate and there’s some horrible things to enable that and
as empirical evidence shows, it’s a security nightmare.</p>
<p>I’m willing to go on record and say that everything using approaches like these is broken and should
be considered insecure.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-mitigation">Vulnerability mitigation</h2>
<p>With Go’s vulnerability they had to
<a href="https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator/tree/master/advisories">fix the round-trip instability in Go’s XML stack</a>,
and also as a safety precaution include
<a href="https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator">round-trip stability validation</a> before
actually processing the XML.</p>
<p>To recap, instead of validating signature from a bunch of bytes, for SAML signature validation we need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/57640cc7a9f69ae71ac446449ead377974f3c8b9/connector/saml/saml.go#L303">Round-trip stability validation</a>
(= XML parsing + encoding)</li>
<li>XML parsing (again)</li>
<li>XML canonicalization (XML dsig, which is encoding again but with specific complex rules and transforms)</li>
</ul>
<p>If that sounds complex to you, it’s because it is.
The more complex something is, the more likely it is to have bugs and security issues.</p>
<h2 id="how-could-saml-have-been-designed-better">How could SAML have been designed better?</h2>
<p>I’m an amateur, so take my idea with a grain of salt, but let’s try.</p>
<p>(Note: this post is all pseudo code - it’s not real SAML. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/766fc7ad990b51f656e03f03e157ba81da132552/connector/saml/testdata/assertion-signed.xml#L2">a real example</a> if you’re interested.)</p>
<p>Instead of doing something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;SAMLSignedDocument&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;SAMLSignature&gt;</span>e58dc03a7491f9e5fb2ed664b23d826489c42cc5<span>&lt;/SAMLSignature&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;SAMLContentToSign&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;Assertion&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;UserId&gt;</span>Joonas<span>&lt;/UserId&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;/Assertion&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/SAMLContentToSign&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/SAMLSignedDocument&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>(Which we established is difficult to sign/verify correctly and securely.)</p>
<p>Take the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> and serialize its sub-tree into bytes and store it as base64 or similar, so we
can transport it as bytes and only XML-parse it once the signature has been verified:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;SAMLSignedDocument&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;SAMLSignature&gt;</span>e58dc03a7491f9e5fb2ed664b23d826489c42cc5<span>&lt;/SAMLSignature&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;SAMLContentToSign&gt;</span>PEFzc2VydGlvbj48VXNlcklkPkpvb25hczwvVXNlcklkPjwvQXNzZXJ0aW9uPgo=<span>&lt;/SAMLContentToSign&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/SAMLSignedDocument&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I don’t understand much about XML so there may be even prettier ways to transport strings or byte data,
but this should be enough to make a point.</p>
<p>This way they could’ve kept the property of everything being inside the one XML document - but you
just need to XML-parse twice:</p>
<ol>
<li>First the outer document, then validate the signature against the byte blob</li>
<li>If the signature matches, only then parse the inner validated document</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, purists may argue that storing XML inside XML as a string or bytes is ugly (and I agree with you),
but look what we achieved.. The tradeoff is worth it - everything inside <code>SAMLContentToSign</code> is now
non-malleable and you don’t need to parse security-critical data before it’s validated as coming from
a trusted source. And we don’t need the vomit that is “XML dsig”.</p>
<h2 id="more-saml-weirdness">More SAML weirdness</h2>
<p>SAML requires you to support use cases where the root of the XML document is unsigned, i.e. you only
sign the assertion elements. What is the purpose of allowing attacker-controlled data?
<a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/766fc7ad990b51f656e03f03e157ba81da132552/connector/saml/saml.go#L621">You need additional code</a>
to discard the unsafe data in these cases anyway because it’d be a catastrophe if you’d end up using it.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-saml-used-if-it-sucks">Why is SAML used if it sucks?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m not aware of a better standard - although I don’t know the space well.</p>
<p>OAuth2 exists but is geared towards getting authorization to resources, so it’s not an authentication /
identity protocol per se.
<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/saml-vs-oauth/">More on the differences</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/whats-the-difference-between-oauth-openid-connect-and-saml/">OpenID Connect</a> is also a thing.</p>
<p>My guess is also that once a standard gains traction, it’s hard to migrate to a better option
even if one is available, since the previous option already has critical mass (think Whatsapp vs. Signal).</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>Let’s get rid of SAML. 🗑️ Some experts seem to recommend OAuth2 or OpenID Connect:</p>

<h2 id="ignorance-is-bliss">Ignorance is bliss</h2>
<p>It is my experience that the more you learn about any subject, the more you realize it’s all held
together by bubblegum and duct tape.
It’s honestly pretty anxiety inducing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was researching about this subject, I also noticed that the Finnish government websites&#39; security
relies on a single-sign-on component implemented in JavaScript (not even TypeScript) which:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vrk-kpa/suomifi-passport-saml/blob/bb18027a6d89ca0b79c70cfdc34dc8fbb48de463/lib/passport-saml/saml.js#L1466">Casually parses security-critical certificates with string replaces</a>.</li>
<li>Mixes Node-style callbacks and explicit Promise usage, i.e. has different flow control styles.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vrk-kpa/suomifi-passport-saml/blob/bb18027a6d89ca0b79c70cfdc34dc8fbb48de463/lib/passport-saml/saml.js#L1342">It’s only one forgotten <code>return</code> away from catastrophic flow control bug</a>
where execution accidentally flows to <code>processValidlySignedPostRequest</code> despite signature validation error.
<ul>
<li>But that’s what you get when you implement security-critical software with a language where flow
control is not a language feature but a library feature built on top of the language.</li>
<li>TypeScript would at least have given proper async/await flow control with the compiler noticing most of the bugs.</li>
<li>Update: great news, <a href="https://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml">the upstream project</a> the Finnish
gov’t fork is based on, had recently been migrated to TypeScript. 🎉</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>Many years ago NRI adopted Elm as a frontend language. We started small with a disposable proof of concept, and as the engineering team increasingly was bought into Elm being a <em>much</em> better developer experience than JavaScript more and more of our frontend development happened in Elm. Today almost all of our frontend is written in Elm.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the backend, we use Ruby on Rails. Rails has served us well and has supported amazing growth of our website, both in terms of the features it supports, and the number of students and teachers who use it. But we’ve come to miss some of the tools that make us so productive in Elm: Tools like custom types for modeling data, or the type checker and its helpful error messages, or the ease of writing (fast) tests.</p><p>A couple of years ago we started looking into Haskell as an alternative backend language that could bring to our backend some of the benefits we experience writing Elm in the frontend. Today some key parts of our backend code are written in Haskell. Over the years we’ve developed our style of writing Haskell, which can be described as very Elm-like (it’s also still changing!).</p><p>Elm is a small language with great error messages, great documentation, and a great community. Together these make Elm one of the nicest programming languages <em>to learn</em>. Participants in an <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/elmbridge/curriculum">ElmBridge</a> event will go from knowing nothing of the language to writing a real application using Elm in 5 hours.</p><p>We have a huge amount of Elm code at NoRedInk, and it supports some pretty tricky UI work. Elm scales well to a growing and increasingly complicated codebase. The compiler stays fast and we don’t lose confidence in our ability to make changes to our code. You can learn more about our Elm story <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs">here</a>.</p><p>Haskell shares a lot of the language features we like in Elm: Custom types to help us model our data. Pure functions and explicit side effects. Writing code without runtime exceptions (mostly).</p><p>When it comes to ease of learning, Haskell makes different trade-offs than Elm. The language is much bigger, especially when including the many optional language features that can be enabled. It’s entirely up to you whether you want to use these features in your code, but you’ll need to know about many of them if you want to make use of Haskell’s packages, documentation, and how-tos. Haskell’s compiler errors typically aren’t as helpful as Elm’s are. Finally, we’ve read many Haskell books and blog posts, but haven’t found anything getting us from knowing no Haskell to writing a real application in it that’s anywhere near as small and effective as the <a href="https://href.li/?https://guide.elm-lang.org/">Elm Guide</a>.</p><p>Many of the niceties we’re used to in Elm we get in Haskell too. But Haskell has many additional features, and each one we use adds to the list of things that an Elm programmer will need to learn. So instead we took a path that many in the Haskell community took before us: limit ourselves to a subset of the language.</p><p>There are many styles of writing Haskell, each with its own trade-offs. Examples include Protolude, RIO, the lens ecosystem, and many more. Our approach differs in being strongly inspired by Elm. So what does our Elm-inspired style of writing Haskell look like?</p><h2>🍇 Low hanging fruit: the Elm standard library</h2><p>Our earliest effort in making our Haskell code more Elm-like was porting the Elm standard library to Haskell. We’ve open-sourced this port as a library named <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude"><code>nri-prelude</code></a>. It contains Haskell counterparts of the Elm modules for working with <code>String</code>s, <code>List</code>s, <code>Dict</code>s, and more.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude"><code>nri-prelude</code></a> also includes a port of <code>elm-test</code>. It provides everything you need for writing unit tests and basic property tests.</p><p>Finally, it includes a GHC plugin that makes it so Haskell’s default <code>Prelude</code> (basically its standard library) behaves like Elm’s defaults. For example, it adds implicit qualified imports of some modules like <code>List</code>, similar to what Elm does.</p><h2>🎚️ Effects and the Absence of The Elm Architecture</h2><p>Elm is opinionated in supporting a single architecture for frontend applications, fittingly called The Elm Architecture. One of its nice qualities is that it forces a separation of application logic (all those conditionals and loops) and effects (things like talking to a database or getting the current time). We love using The Elm Architecture writing frontend applications, but don’t see a way to apply it 1:1 to backend development. In the F# community, they use the Elm Architecture for <em>some</em> backend features (see: <a href="https://href.li/?https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/feature-clientserver-bridge/#when-to-use-elmishbridge">When to use Elmish Bridge</a>), but it’s not generally applicable. We’d still like to encourage that separation between application logic and effects though, having seen some of the effects of losing that distinction in our backend code. Read our other post <a href="https://href.li/?https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Pufferfish-please-scale-the-site-Vbuh8hFWzDYm0FAjNUoaW">+☄️ Pufferfish, please scale the site!</a> if you want to read more about this.</p><p>Out of many options we’re currently using <a href="https://href.li/?https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2018-03-08-handle-pattern.html">the handle pattern</a> for managing effects. For each type of effect, we create a <code>Handler</code> type (we added the extra <code>r</code> in a typo way back and it has stuck around. Sorry). We use this pattern across our libraries for talking to outside systems: <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-postgresql"><code>nri-postgresql</code></a>, <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-http"><code>nri-http</code></a>, <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-redis"><code>nri-redis</code></a>, and <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-kafka"><code>nri-kafka</code></a>.</p><p>Without The Elm Architecture, we depend heavily on chaining permutations through a stateful <code>Task</code> type. This feels similar to imperative coding: First, do A, then B, then C. Hopefully, when we’re later on in our Haskell journey, we’ll discover a nice architecture to simplify our backend code.</p><h2>🚚 Bringing Elm Values to Haskell</h2><p>One way in which Haskell is different from both Elm and Rails is that it is not particularly opinionated. Often the Haskell ecosystem offers multiple different ways to do one particular thing. So whether it’s writing an http server, logging, or talking with a database, the first time we do any of these things we’ll need to decide <em>how</em>.</p><p><strong>When adopting a Haskell feature or library, we care about</strong></p><ul><li>smallness, e.g. introduce new concepts only when necessary</li><li>how “magical” is it? E.g. How <em>surprising</em> is it?</li><li>How easy is it to <em>learn</em>?</li><li>how easy is it to <em>use?</em></li><li>how comprehensible is the documentation?</li><li><em>explicitness</em> over <em>terseness (</em>but terseness isn’t implicitly bad).</li><li>consistency &amp; predictability</li><li>“safety” (no runtime exceptions).</li></ul><p>Sometimes the Haskell ecosystem provides an option that fits our Elm values, like with the handle pattern, and so we go with it. Other times a library has different values, and then the choice not to use it is easy as well. An example of this is lens/prism ecosystem, which allows one to write super succinct code, but is almost a language onto itself that one has to learn first.</p><p>The hardest decisions are the ones where an approach protects us against making mistakes in some way (which we like) but requires familiarity with more language features to use (which we prefer to avoid).</p><p>To help us make better decisions, we often <strong>try it both ways.</strong> That is, we’re willing to build a piece of software with &amp; without a complex language feature to ensure the <em>cost</em> of the complexity is worth the benefit that the feature brings us.</p><p>Another approach we take is making decisions locally. A single team might evaluate a new feature, and then demo it and share it with other teams after they have a good sense the feature is worth it. Remember: a super-power of Haskell is easy refactorability. Unlike our ruby code, going through and doing major re-writes in our Haskell codebase is often an hours-or-days-long (rather than weeks-or-months-long) endeavor. Adopting two different patterns simultaneously has a relatively small cost!</p><h2>Case studies in feature adoption:</h2><h3>🐘 Type-Check All Elephants</h3><p>One example where our approach is Elm-like in some ways but not in others is how we talk to the database. We’re using a GHC feature called quasiquoting for this, which allow us to embed SQL query strings directly into our Haskell code, like this:</p><pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

module Animals (listAll) where

import Postgres (query, sql)

listAll :: Postgres.Handler -&gt; Task Text (List (Text, Text))
listAll postgres =
  query postgres [sql|SELECT species, genus FROM animals|]
</code></pre><p>A library called <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-typed"><code>postgresql-typed</code></a> can test these queries against a real Postgres database and show us an error at compile time if the query doesn’t fit the data. Such a compile-time error might happen if a table or column we reference in a query doesn’t exist in the database. This way we use static checks to eliminate a whole class of potential app/database compatibility problems!</p><p>The downside is that writing code like this requires everyone working with it to learn a bit about quasi quotes, and what return type to expect for different kinds of queries. That said, using some kind of querying library instead has a learning curve too, and query libraries tend to be pretty big to support all the different kinds of queries that can be made.</p><h3>🔣 So Many Webserver Options</h3><p>Another example where we traded additional safety against language complexity is in our choice of webserver library. We went with <code>servant</code> here, a library that lets you express REST APIs using types, like this:</p><pre><code>import Servant

data Routes route = Routes
  { listTodos ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Get &#39;\[JSON\] [Todo],
    updateTodo ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Capture &#34;id&#34; Int
        :&gt; ReqBody &#39;[JSON] Todo
        :&gt; Put &#39;[JSON] NoContent,
    deleteTodo ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Capture &#34;id&#34; Int
        :&gt; Delete &#39;[JSON] NoContent
  }
  deriving (Generic)
</code></pre><p>Servant is a big library that makes use of a lot of type-level programming techniques, which are pretty uncommon in Elm, so there’s a steep learning cost associated with <em>understanding</em> how the type magic works. Using it without a deep understanding is reasonably straightforward.</p><p>The benefits gained from using Servant outweigh the cost of expanded complexity. Based on a type like the one in the example above, the servant ecosystem can generate functions in other languages like Elm or Ruby. Using these functions means we can save time with backend-to-frontend or service-to-service communication. If some Haskell type changes in a backward-incompatible fashion we will generate new Elm code, and this might introduce a compiler error on the Elm side.</p><p>So for now we’re using servant! It’s important to note that what we <em>want</em> is compile-time server/client compatibility checking, and that’s why we swallow Servant’s complexity. If we could get the same benefit without the type-level programming demonstrated above, we would prefer that. Hopefully, in the future, another library will offer the same benefits from a more Elm-like API.</p><p>We’re running the libraries discussed above in production. Our most-used Haskell application receives hundreds of thousands of requests per minute without issue and produces hardly any errors.</p><p>Code can be found at <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/NoRedInk/haskell-libraries"><code>NoRedInk/haskell-libraries</code></a>. Libraries have been published to hackage and stackage. We’d love to know what you think!</p>

      <title>Lead Poisoning and Rome</title>
      <link>http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html</link>
      <description></description>

  <p></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
    Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.&#34;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Jeremiah, 6:29-30</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A 1983 article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> by Jerome Nriagu, 
  a geochemist, rekindled a debate that had been dormant for almost two decades. There, and in a book published later that year, he argued 
  that &#34;lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire.&#34; Yet, a review by  Scarborough, a pharmacist and classicist,  
  found the book to be &#34;so full of false evidence, miscitations, 
  typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that 
  the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.&#34; He concluded that, although 
  ancient authorities were aware of lead poisoning, it was not endemic in the 
  Roman empire nor caused its fall. Waldron, a specialist in both occupational 
  medicine and archaeology, also criticized the author for not using primary 
  sources and being uncritical of the translated material that he did use, 
  cautioning that &#34;The decline of the Roman Empire is a phenomenon of great 
  complexity and it is simplistic to ascribe it to a single cause.&#34; More than 
  thirty years later, Scarborough&#39;s comments still rankled, Nriagu retorting in 
  an interview that he &#34;knows nothing, absolutely nothing, about lead 
  poisoning, Absolutely zero.&#34; Such was the contention that the topic evoked.</p>
  <p>Lead (Pb) does not occur in an elemental state but is a by-product of silver mining. Extracted from galena ore (PbS, lead sulfide), 
  which is crushed and smelted, the lead was further refined by the Romans in a furnace made hotter still by blasts of 
  forced air  from a bellows 
  (Pliny, <i>Natural History</i>, XXXIII.159). The oxidized lead (PbO, litharge), 
  which was contained in a porous crucible of crushed bone ash, was absorbed, 
  leaving behind a trace amount of silver in a process called &#34;cupellation&#34; 
  (from the cupel used to collect the metal). The lead itself then was recovered by smelting the litharge again with galena, the lead oxide combining with lead sulfide to form 
  metallic lead and sulfur dioxide (2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO<SPAN size="-1">2</SPAN>).</p>
  <p>The ore was readily abundant and in Britannia so near the 
  surface that restrictions limited the quantity that could be produced 
  (XXXIV.164). Once smelted, the lead (<i>plumbum</i>) was easily malleable and had a 
  low melting point<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>ideal 
  for the production of water pipes, which were fabricated by <i>plumbarii</i> (plumbers) from fitted rolled sheets in a variety of 
  diameters (Pliny, XXXI.58; Vitruvius, <i>On Architecture</i>, VIII.6.1ff; Frontinus, <i>On the 
  Aqueducts of Rome</i>, I.37ff). Together with concrete, sheets of lead also were used to line the channels of Roman aqueducts (cf. Vitruvius, II.6.1). </p>
  <p>But lead also was known to be dangerous and, for that 
  reason, pipes made of clay were 
  preferred<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>as Vitruvius, who wrote during 
  the time of Augustus, explains.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that 
    through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from 
    it white lead [PbCO<SPAN size="-1">3, </SPAN>lead carbonate] is obtained, and this is said to 
    be injurious to the human system. Hence, if what is generated from it is pernicious, there can be no doubt that itself cannot be a 
    wholesome body. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; for in casting lead, the fumes from 
    it fixing on the different members, and daily burning them, destroy the vigour of the blood; water should therefore on no account be 
    conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome. That the flavour of that conveyed in earthen pipes is better, 
    is shewn at our daily meals, for all those whose tables are furnished with silver vessels, nevertheless use those made of earth, from 
    the purity of the flavour being preserved in them&#34; (VIII.6.10-11).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Columella remarks on the advantage of terracotta pipes as well. &#34;Rain-water is after all most suitable to the body&#39;s health, and is 
  regarded as uncommonly good if it is conveyed through earthen pipes into a covered cistern&#34; (<i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, I.5.2). Not only wholesome, rainwater was known to have the least amount of contamination (Celsus,<i> On 
  Medicine</i>, II.18.12)<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>as Hippocrates had 
  observed more than four hundred 
  years earlier. &#34;Rain waters, then, are the lightest, the sweetest, the 
  thinnest, and the clearest&#34; (<i>On Airs, Waters, and Places</i>, VIII). Horace celebrated spring water for the same reason, 
  asking &#34;Is the water purer which in city-streets struggles to burst its leaden 
  pipes than that which dances and purls adown the sloping brook?&#34; (<i>Epistles</i>, 
  X.20-21). </p>
  <p>Slightly acidic, rain dissolves carbon dioxide in the 
  atmosphere to form a weak solution of carbonic acid, which in turn reacts with calcium hydroxide 
  (the slaked lime that, together with volcanic ash and aggregate, comprised 
  Roman concrete) to form calcium carbonate (CaCO<SPAN size="-1">3</SPAN>). 
  Water from the river Anio, which fed two of Rome&#39;s principal aqueducts, the Aqua Anio Vetus and Aqua Anio Novus, 
  was particularly hard and conveyed high levels of dissolved calcium 
  carbonate. Indeed, Frontinus complains in his 
  treatise on the aqueducts of Rome, that &#34;the accumulation of deposit, which 
  sometimes hardens into a crust, contracts the channel of the water&#34; (CXXII.1). 
  At Nmes, the accretion of calcium carbonate increased 
  approximately one millimeter per year (about four inches every century) and constricted 
  the channel of the Pont du Gard by more than a third of its width. This limestone encrustation (<i>sinter</i>, 
  from the German), which had to be periodically chipped away, suggests that deposits 
  of calcium carbonate in pipes and aqueducts protected against corrosion and 
  insulated against the introduction of lead into the water they conveyed. Too, 
  with no taps to shut off, water flowed continuously and so would not have been in prolonged 
  contact with the metal. And, in any event, most water brought to Rome by its 
  aqueducts was used to supply the public baths. </p>
  <p>Rather than encrusted lead pipes, the probable cause of chronic lead poisoning (plumbism or &#34;saturnism&#34; because its symptoms seemed 
  indicative of the god&#39;s melancholic and sullen character) was the consumption of <i>defrutum</i> and <i>sapa</i>. 
  The elder Cato, Columella, and Pliny all describe how unfermented grape juice (<i>mustum</i>, 
  must) was boiled to concentrate its 
  natural sugars. &#34;A product of art, not of nature,&#34; the must was reduced to one half (<i>defrutum</i>) or even one third its volume (<i>sapa</i>) 
  (Pliny, XIV.80), although the terms are not always consistent.  Columella identifies <i>defrutum</i> 
  as &#34;must of the 
  sweetest possible flavour&#34; that has been boiled down to a third of its volume 
  (XXI.1). Isidore of Seville, writing in the seventh century AD, says that it 
  is <i>sapa</i> that has been reduced by a third and imagines that <i>
  defrutum</i> was so called because it has been cheated or defrauded (<i>defrudare</i>) 
  (<i>Etymologies</i>, XX.3.15). Varro reverses Pliny&#39;s proportions altogether (quoted in Nonius Marcellus, <i>De 
  Conpendiosa Doctrina, </i>XVIII.551M).</p>
  <p>The thickened syrup was used to sweeten and preserve wine and fruit that otherwise was sour or would spoil. Cato recommends 
  that quinces and pears be preserved in boiled must (<i>On Agriculture</i>, VII.3) as does Varro (<i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, I.59.3). Columella insists that <i>defrutum</i> 
  always be boiled with quinces or some other flavoring (XII.20.2). Apicius offers directions for preserving 
  quinces in <i>defrutum</i> and honey (<i>De Re Coquinaria, </i>I.21) and added 
  the rich syrup to almost a fifth of his sauces to enhance the color and flavor 
  of almost every dish. (That color was added indicates that red, rather 
  than white, wine was used in the reduction.)</p>
  <p><i>Defrutum</i> and <i>sapa</i> were dangerous not in themselves but in 
  their preparation. In <i>De Agricultura</i>, the earliest example of Latin prose (c.160 BC), Cato gives directions for reducing must in &#34;a copper or lead 
  vessel&#34; over a slow fire, &#34;stirring constantly to prevent scorching; continue the boiling, until you have boiled off a half&#34; (CVII). 
  Writing in the first century AD, Columella elaborates on the process.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Some people put the must in leaden vessels and by boiling reduce it by a quarter, others by a third. There is no doubt that anyone 
    who boiled it down to one-half would be likely to make a better thick form of must and therefore more profitable for use....But, before 
    the must is poured into the boiling-vessels, it will be well that those which are made of lead should be coated inside with good oil and 
    be well-rubbed, and that then the must should be put in....The vessels themselves in which the thickened and boiled-down must is boiled 
    should be of lead rather than of brass; for, in the boiling, brazen vessels throw off copper rust, and spoil the flavour 
    of the preservative&#34; (XII.19.1, 19.6, 20.1).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Pliny, too, recommends that the must be prepared in lead vessels.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Also boiled-down must and must of new wine should be boiled when there 
    is no moon, which means at the conjunction of that planet, and not on any 
    other day; and moreover leaden and not copper jars should be used, and some 
    walnuts should be thrown into the liquor, for those are said to absorb the 
    smoke&#34; (XIV.136).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It would seem therefore that must was boiled in lead cauldrons. But 
  Scarborough is reluctant to weaken his case, insisting that &#34;one needs to read 
  these texts carefully which mention a &#39;preference&#39; for lead over bronze to 
  realize that the Romans most often used bronze cauldrons (copper and tin in 
  alloy), not those of lead&#34; and that the short boiling time would not have 
  contaminated the juice in any event. But copper and bronze are suspect as 
  well. Not only, says Pliny, was the best bronze alloyed with 10% lead and 
  tin (XXXIV.95) but &#34;When copper 
  vessels are coated with <i>stagnum</i> [a lead alloy], the contents have a 
  more agreeable taste and the formation of destructive verdigris is prevented&#34; 
  (XXXIV.160).</p>
  <p>The verdigris about which Pliny complains is  copper acetate, a bitter salt 
   
  first  described by Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle, in <i>De Re Metallica</i> 
  (IX), that is formed when acetic acid (the component that gives vinegar its sour taste 
  and pungent smell) reacts with copper oxide. Commercially, it was 
  manufactured by exposing copper plates to strong vinegar or the<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> 
  soured </SPAN>grape skins and lees of wine dregs (Dioscorides, <i>Materia 
  Medica</i>, V.91). Acetic acid also reacts with lead oxide (litharge) to 
  create another metallic salt: lead acetate or sugar of lead. Although as sweet 
  as sugar (which was unknown to the Romans), it actually added very little to the sweetness 
  of the <i>defrutum</i>, which derived from the concentrated 
  glucose and fructose of the grapes themselves. What it did import was an onerous burden of 
  lead. </p>
  <p>Eisinger found that must reduced in a lead-lined pot to one-third its volume 
  contained approximately one gram of lead per liter. If, as Columella recommends (XII.20.3), one <i>sextarius</i> of <i>defrutum</i> 
  was mixed with one <i>amphora</i> of wine, the resulting proportion would be one part 
  in forty-eight or almost 21 milligrams of lead per liter (mg/L)<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>a 
  burden of lead so high as to be scarcely credible. Just three deciliters<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>the equivalent of two 
  five-ounce glasses<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>would contain almost 2100 
  micrograms per deciliter (g/dL) and certainly induce symptoms of lead 
  poisoning<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>even more readily if one were 
  to follow 
  Cato&#39;s recommendation of one part in thirty (XXIV). That having been said, smaller vessels have a larger surface area relative to their volume. The four-liter pot used by Patterson et al. to 
  produce <i>sapa</i> of the same concentration (1000 ppm) presumably would leach out more of the metal than the huge cauldron mentioned by Columella (XII.20.3), 
  in which ninety <i>amphorae</i> (each holding about 26 liters) of must was reduced. 
  This cauldron &#34;should be coated inside with good oil and be well rubbed&#34; 
  (XII.19.6); Cato speaks of his own wine vats being treated with pitch (II.3), 
  and one wonders if Patterson, following a recipe provided by Gilfillan, did 
  the same.</p>
  <p>Such levels of lead have significant physiological consequences. A single 
  teaspoon of Columellan wine would have approximately 103 g/dL of lead. As reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is 
  brain and kidney damage in adults with blood lead levels of 100 g/dL; gastrointestinal symptoms such as colic with levels of 
  approximately 60 g/dL; anemia with levels of 50 to 80 g/dL; neurological symptoms with levels of 40 to 60 g/dL; depressed sperm count 
  with levels of 40 to 50 g/dL; and increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and impaired mental development with maternal 
  blood lead levels of 10 to 15 g/dL. The physiological insult to children is even greater.  Since 2012, 
  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended intervention in 
  children five years or younger when the level of lead in the blood is above 5 g/dL 
  and even may lower that figure to 3.5 g/dL. </p>
  <p>Nriagu estimates the aristocracy of Rome to have consumed two liters of 
  wine a day<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> or </SPAN>almost three bottles (which 
  would seem to make alcoholism more suspect than lead poisoning<SPAN face="Times New Roman">)
  </SPAN>and the resulting lead intake to have averaged 180 g daily. He further 
  estimates the total amount of lead absorbed from all sources to be 250 g per 
  day and lead concentration in the blood to be 50 g/dL<SPAN face="Times New Roman">,
  </SPAN>at least for the gluttonous and bibulous (as he phrases it) and those 
  with an appetite for adulterated wines and sweetened dainties<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>who 
  he presumes most Roman emperors to have been. </p>
  <p>In fact, there is no way to quantify what Roman aristocrats actually did 
  eat or drink, nor to determine the varying relationship between ingested lead 
  and blood lead levels. If Nriagu&#39;s assumptions are correct, his contention 
  that &#34;a large number of Roman aristocrats ingested more than enough lead with 
  their foods and drinks each day to put them at risk for lead poisoning&#34; 
  would be as 
  well. But often, to take one example, they are not.</p>
  <p>During the vintage, says Cato, inferior grapes were set aside, to be saved 
  &#34;for the sharp wine for the hands to drink, when the time comes&#34; (XXIII.2), 
  which were the three months following the vintage (LVII). Issued instead of 
  wine in winter, this &#34;after-wine&#34; or <i>lora</i> was made from 
  grape skins and pulp mixed with water and pressed a second time, its 
  sharp bitterness so called because it &#34;tastes of the knife&#34; (Varro, I.54.3; 
  cf. Pliny, XIV.86, who felt that what was extracted from lees and grape skins 
  soaked in water &#34;cannot rightly be styled wines&#34; ). 
  In calculating the ration of wine for his workers (<i>familiae</i>, as they 
  were part of the family household), Cato provides the only contemporary figures for 
  wine consumption which, for the remaining three quarters of the year, varied 
  seasonally from one, two, or three <i>heminae</i> 
  per day. An additional three-and-a-half <i>congii</i> (another forty-two <i>heminae</i>) were 
  issued to celebrate the <i>Saturnalia</i> and <i>
  Compitalia</i>. In total, seven <i>amphora</i>e of wine were allotted during 
  these nine months (LVII), almost two-and-a-half <i>heminae</i> or about 663 ml. daily. 
  For the other three months of the year, an indeterminate amount of watery <i>
  lora</i> was drunk. In considering the same passage, Nriagu is not so nuanced 
  and says 
  simply that Cato recommends 
  &#34;about 750 ml of the afterwine&#34; per day.</p>
  <p>It should be remembered, too, that  Romans diluted their wine. Unmixed wine (<i>merum</i>) 
  was considered the drink of provincials, barbarians<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, 
  and drunkards</SPAN>. Mixed, the proportion of water and wine varied, 
  sometimes 
  dictated by a <i>magister bibendi </i>chosen by lot<i> </i>at a <i>comissatio</i> 
  (Horace, <i>Odes</i>, I.4.18, II.7.25) or determined by the guests 
  themselves, drinking from cups large or small &#34;not bound by crazy laws&#34; 
  (Horace, <i>Satires</i>, II.6.69). Even then, a <i>magistra</i> was in 
  attendance: the restraint of <i>culpa</i> itself and not being thought culpable of  drinking to excess (<i>Satires</i>, II.2.123). </p>
  <p>Athenaeus, a Greek rhetorician who flourished in the reigns of Marcus 
  Aurelius and Commodus, writes of the matter in detail. In the <i>
  Deipnosophistae</i>, when the learned conversation of the symposiasts eventually 
  turns to the mixing of wine, a proverb was recalled: &#34;Drink either five 
  or three or at least not four&#34; (X.80). It was a saying that earlier had piqued 
  the interest of Plutarch, who explains that one should drink either five or 
  three portions of wine to water but not four<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>five 
  being three cups of water mixed with two of wine and three, two cups mixed 
  with one. Four, three cups of water to one of wine, &#34;a mixture sober and weak 
  enough&#34;  was not recommended. Rather, the most harmonious of proportion was 
  two to three, &#34;stilling and appeasing all proud and disordered passions within 
  the heart, and inducing instead of them a peaceable calm and tranquility&#34; (<i>Table 
  Talk</i>, III.9).</p>
  <p>There were other ratios of course. Horace cautions that 
  those who revere the three Graces should mix no more than one part of wine 
  with three of water<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>but for the poet who celebrates the nine Muses, the ratio<i> </i>
  should be inverted. (<i>Odes</i>, III.19). And Martial teases a companion who 
  repeatedly drank water with his wine and the  wine only sparingly, joking 
  that he must be staying sober so to enjoy an amorous evening (<i>Epigrams</i>, 
  I.106). A pretentious equestrian such as Sextilianus, on the other hand, is 
  lampooned for drinking his wine unmixed, which made the warm water that would 
  have heated it unnecessary (I.11).  Martial chides that, if he is to drink so 
  much at public festivals (more than his allotment of tokens), at least it should not be Opimius but a cheaper wine (I.26). A 
  celebrated vintage of 121 BC, Opimius was by then almost two hundred years 
  old<SPAN face="Times New Roman">and, ironically, </SPAN>intolerably bitter and impossible to drink without being mixed with water 
  (Pliny, XIV.55). Of the two liters 
  of wine that Nriagu estimates aristocrats to have been drunk every day, were 
  they mixed with two parts of water (Plutarch&#39;s favored portion), only two-thirds of a liter (four-and-a-half glasses)  would have been 
  undiluted wine.</p>
  <p>Almost twenty years earlier, Gilfillan had insisted (his &#34;novel theory&#34; restating 
  a notion first proposed in German by Kobert in 1909) that &#34;lead poisoning is 
  to be reckoned the major influence in the ruin of the Roman culture, 
  progressiveness, and genius,&#34; threatening the cognition and fertility of the 
  nobility. But that proposition, too, was debunked by Needleman and Needleman, 
  who demonstrated that the decline of the Roman 
  aristocracy could as easily be explained by the simple desire not to marry or to 
  rear few or no children. In 18 BC and AD 9, Augustus had sought to 
  promote marriage and encourage procreation. &#34;And yet, marriages and the rearing of children did not become more frequent, so powerful were the 
  attractions of a childless state&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, III.25). In a review of the life span of emperors and 
  aristocrats, Scheidel dismisses any impact of lead ingestion on fertility. 
  &#34;Nor is there any need to suspect that the incidence of marital sterility in 
  the Roman ruling class might have been much higher than in other groups, 
  times, and places.&#34; Drasch found that the average lead burden in Rome was not significantly 
  higher than in the legionary camp and provincial capital at Augsburg in 
  Bavaria. In 
  Britain, the skeletal lead burden was even higher than in Rome. Still, Nriagu insists that &#34;one 
  of the principle, probable causes of the internal weaknesses&#34; of the Roman empire was lead poisoning of the aristocracy.</p>
  <p>Certainly,  Romans knew lead to be dangerous, even if they did not associate it with their lead cooking vessels 
  or the preparation of <i>sapa</i>. Pliny speaks of the 
  &#34;noxious and deadly vapour&#34; (sulfur dioxide) of the lead furnace (XXXIV.167; there 
  was, in fact, a four-fold increase in atmospheric Pb 
  pollution during the Greco-Roman period); red lead (<i>minium</i>) 
  (XXXIII.124) and white lead (ceruse) (XXXIV.176) as poisonous, 
  even though both were used as a medicine and cosmetic; and the power of <i>sapa</i> (and onion) to induce an abortion (XXIII.30). 
  Dioscorides cautions against taking white lead internally, as it is deadly (V.103). Soranus recommends that the 
  mouth of the uterus be smeared with white lead to prevent conception (<i>Gynecology</i>, 
  I.19.61). Galen (<i>On Antidotes</i>, XIV.144) and Celsus (V.27.12b) both 
  provide an antidote for poisoning by white lead, and Vitruvius remarks on the 
  pernicious effects of water found near lead mines and its effect on the body 
  (VIII.3.5, 6.11).</p>
  <p>The earliest description of acute lead poisoning (mid-second century BC) is given in the <i>Alexipharmaca</i> of Nicander, who speaks of 
  &#34;gleaming, deadly white lead whose fresh colour is like milk which foams all over&#34; (II.74ff). The poet describes a frothing mouth, 
  asperity of the tongue, and dry throat, together with dry retching, chills, delusions, and overwhelming fatigue. But if lead poisoning had 
  been endemic, it presumably would have been remarked upon at the time. And yet there is no mention of the fact until early in the seventh 
  century AD, when Paul of Aegina, a Byzantine physician, described chronic lead 
  poisoning (although he does not associate its symptoms with the disease). &#34;I am of the opinion that the colic affection which now 
  prevails is occasioned by such humours; the disease having taken its rise in the country of Italy, but raging also in many other regions 
  of the Roman empire, like a pestilential contagion, which in many cases terminates in epilepsy, but in others in paralysis of the 
  extremities, while the sensibility of them is preserved, and sometimes both these afflictions attacking together&#34; (III.64).</p>
  <p><i>Defrutum</i> was only one of several remedies to sweeten or preserve potentially sour wine<SPAN face="Times New Roman">. 
  P</SPAN>itch, resin, ash, and sea water also were added (Pliny, XIV.124ff)<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, 
  as well as marble dust (Cato, XXIII.3); </SPAN> and aromatic spices such as 
  myrrh, cinnamon, balsam, and saffron added to the <i>defrutum</i> (Columella, XII.20.5). Such was the use 
  of additives that Martial accuses a wine merchant of Marseilles of shipping poisonous and overpriced wines to his 
  friends and, indeed, being reluctant to visit Rome for fear of having to drink them himself (X.36). 
  And Pliny complains 
  that &#34;genuine, unadulterated wine is not to be had now, not even by the nobility&#34; (XXIII.1), ruefully remarking &#34;So many poisons are 
  employed to force wine to suit our tasteand we are surprised that it is not wholesome!&#34; (XIV.130). Indeed, &#34;So low has our commercial 
  honesty sank that only the names of vintages are sold, the wines being adulterated as soon as they are poured into the vats. Accordingly, 
  strange though it may seem, the more common the wine is today, the freer it is 
  from impurities&#34; (XXIII.34). </p>
  <p>Columella regards &#34;as the best wine any kind which can keep without any preservative, nor should anything at all be mixed with 
  it by which its natural savour would be obscured; for that wine is most excellent which has given pleasure by its own natural quality&#34; 
  (XII.19.2). Further, &#34;care must be taken that the flavour of the preservative is not noticeable, for that drives away the purchaser&#34; 
  (XII.20.7). Writing several decades later in the first century AD, Dioscorides says much the same thing. &#34;Generally, all unmixed and simple wine 
  (hard by nature) is warming, easily digested and good for the stomach. It encourages the appetite, is nourishing, induces sleep, and 
  causes a good colour&#34; (V.11). Those with <i>sapa</i>, however, &#34;fill the head causing drunkenness.&#34; One should 
  drink moderately and (because alcohol is a diuretic and dehydrates the body) drink water both before and afterwards, &#34;for it brings some 
  help in avoiding illness owing to drunkenness.&#34; </p>
  <p>The best tasting wine, therefore, was unadulterated and presumably the wine 
  drunk by the nobility, who supposedly 
  were most at risk for lead poisoning. More than wine or water transported through lead pipes, 
  it was the dainties and elaborate sauces prepared 
  with <i>defrutum</i> by gourmands such as <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/apicius.html">
  <SPAN color="#450C02">Apicius</SPAN></a> that 
  were the primary source of ingested lead 
  by the Roman aristocracy.</p>

  <p>A teacher of Epictetus and &#34;a man devoted to the study of philosophy and in 
  particular to the Stoic doctrine&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Histories, </i>III.81), 
  Musonius Rufus was compared by Origen to Socrates himself as a model of the 
  excellent life (<i>Against Celsus</i>, III.66). He may have nearly died while 
  imprisoned by Nero (Philostratus, <i>Life of Apollonius</i>, IV.35), who later 
  exiled Musonius to a desolate island in the Cyclades because of his 
  prominence and influence in &#34;the precepts of philosophy&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, 
  XV.71). When Vespasian expelled all the other philosophers from the city in 
  about AD 71 (Dio, <i>Roman History</i>, LXV.13), Musonius alone was exempted, 
  only later to be banished to Syria, where he was esteemed by Pliny the 
  Younger, who was serving there (<i>Letters</i>, XXXI). Recalled to Rome by 
  Titus in AD 79 (Jerome, <i>Chronica</i>, 214th Olympiad), he died  
  sometime before AD 102.</p>
  <p>Musonius is cited by Nriagu in a quotation from <i>Apician Morsels; or, Tales of 
  the Table, Kitchen, and Larder</i>, a farrago of gastronomical curiosities on
  <span>a new and improved code of <i>eatics</i>; 
  select epicurean precepts; nutritive maxims, reflections, anecdotes, &amp;c.</span>&#34; 
  (to partially quote the subtitle) that was published in 1829 under the 
  pseudonym of Dick Humelbergius Secundus (a whimsical allusion to a 
  sixteenth-century editor of Apicius).</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>&#34;That masters are less strong, less healthy, less able to endure labour 
  than servants; countrymen more strong than those who are bred in the city, 
  those that feed meanly than those who feed daintily; and that, generally, the 
  latter live longer than the former. Nor are are there any other persons more 
  troubled with gouts, dropsies, colics, and the like, than those who, 
  condemning simple diet, live upon prepared dainties&#34; (p. 39).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Although the passage is not referenced, it is from Musonius&#39; lecture &#34;On 
  Food&#34; (XVIIIB), summarized in Greek by one of his students. In making his 
  argument, Nriagu takes the last sentence at face value. But it is missing in 
  more authoritative translations.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Quite the contrary, people who eat the cheapest food are the strongest. 
    Indeed you may notice that slaves are usually stronger than their masters, 
    country men than city men, the poor than the rich, better able to do hard 
    work, less fatigued by their labor, less frequently ill, enduring more 
    cheerfully cold, heat, lack of sleep, and every such hardship.&#34; (trans. 
    Lutz, 1947)</p>
    <p>&#34;Indeed, those who eat the least expensive foods are the strongest. Thus, 
    slaves are generally stronger than their masters, country folk are stronger 
    than city folk, and the poor are stronger than the rich. Furthermore, those 
    who eat inexpensive food can work harder, are less fatigued by working, and 
    are sick less often those those who eat expensive food. Also, they are 
    better able to tolerate cold, heat, lack of sleep, and so forth.&#34; (trans. 
    King, 2010)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nriagu also understands Musonius to be &#34;an eyewitness,&#34;  which 
  in his book is emended to read &#34;an actual eyewitness account,&#34; and &#34;masters&#34; 
  to be the &#34;aristocrats...of his time&#34;<SPAN face="Times New Roman">assumptions</SPAN> 
  that simply are not supported by the actual quotation. They are confounded even more 
  by someone such as Cato, a staunch defender of republican virtue and rustic 
  austerity who would not have considered himself an aristocrat. As <i>pater familias</i>, 
  he was absolute master of 
  his household family (the word, in fact, is translated as &#34;master&#34; in <i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, II.1), but then, having worked next to his servants, he &#34;sat down 
  with them to eat of the same bread and drink of the same wine&#34; (Plutarch, <i>
  Life of Cato the Elder</i>, III.2). </p>

  <p>One reads that Hippocrates (died c. 370 BC) was the 
  first to describe lead colic in a metal worker. Although a primary source 
  almost never is provided, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica 
  Online</i> does say, in its entry on <i>Occupational Disease: The Preindustrial 
  Era,</i> that &#34;The first recorded observation of an 
  occupational disease may be a case of severe lead colic suffered by a worker who extracted metals. It is described in the third book of <i>
  Epidemics</i>, attributed to Hippocrates.&#34; </p>
  <p>In fact, the reference is from <i>Epidemics</i> IV.25, where there is brief 
  mention of a man &#34;from the mines&#34; who, among his other symptoms, was pale. 
  And, indeed, miners often were described as <i>pallidus</i>. Vitruvius remarks 
  on the pallid color of lead workers. Lucan (<i>Pharsalia</i>, IV.298), Silius 
  Italicus (<i>Punica</i>, I.233), and Statius (<i>Silvae</i>, IV.7.15) all 
  comment, however, on the pallor of gold miners, especially those from Asturias in 
  northern Spain, the mining operations which Pliny may have witnessed for himself 
  (XXXIII.66ff). But it is facile to assume that, because Romans reported symptoms concomitant with 
  lead poisoning, they necessarily were caused by leador, to phrase it another way, that if lead poisoning 
  has certain symptoms, the same 
  symptoms can be attributed to it<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>as 
  Waldron comments in his review of Nriagu. While Hippocrates may have known about lead poisoning, Waldron cautions that he &#34;did not describe it in 
  any of the books which have come down to us.&#34;</p>

  <p>An etymological note: &#34;mustard&#34; derives from must, as the juice was used to 
  form a paste of ground mustard seeds. And <i>merum</i> (from <i>merus</i>, 
  &#34;undiluted&#34;) is the root of the archaic &#34;mere,&#34; meaning &#34;pure&#34; 
  (as in Shakespeare&#39;s &#34;mere madness&#34; or C. S. Lewis&#39; <i>Mere Christianity</i>), as opposed to its 
  modern meaning of &#34;nothing more than&#34; (as in a &#34;mere child&#34;).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A note on citations may be in 
  order, as well, in regard to the numerous references to Pliny, whose <i>Natural History</i> 
  is most readily available in a nineteenth-century translation by Bostcock. 
  There &#34;black lead&#34; is referenced as 
  Book XXXIV, Chapter 49. In the original Latin, the chapter is further divided 
  into sections, XXXIV.xlix.164 and XXXIV.xlix.165. Other chapters in the book 
  (xix, for example) comprise more than forty sections. To direct the reader 
  more readily to a specific passage, only the book and section usually are 
  cited<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> in the literaturebut not </SPAN>the chapter<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> 
  (which is redundant). This </SPAN>convention has been followed here. But it means that those who want to read more will be 
  obliged to go to the Latin (online at LacusCurtius), discover the chapter number 
  of the section, and then return to Bostcock.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;But the Goths kept pressing vigorously upon them, shooting many missiles at the battlements, and they were already about to set 
    their ladders against the wall, having practically surrounded those who were fighting from the tomb; for whenever the Goths advanced 
    they always got in the rear of the Romans on both flanks; and for a short time consternation fell upon the Romans, who knew not what 
    means of defence they should employ to save themselves, but afterwards by common agreement they broke in pieces the most of the statues, 
    which were very large, and taking up great numbers of stones thus secured, threw them with both hands down upon the heads of the enemy, 
    who gave way before this shower of missiles.&#34;</p>
    <p>Procopius, <i>The Gothic War (V.22)</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sometime after 1624, when Urban VIII began to fortify Castel Sant&#39;Angelo 
  (Hadrian&#39;s Tomb), stripping the ancient bronze trusses from the portico of the 
  Pantheon to provide metal for the forging of cannons, the Barberini Faun 
  (pictured above) was discovered 
  in the defensive ditch at the foot of the castle. It is pleasing to think that it may have been one of the statues 
  thrown from the wall during the siege of Rome by the Goths in AD 537. Or, 
  since it once was used as a fountain, it may have adorned a garden there. Although 
  called a faun, the ivy wreath garlanding the head (as well as the horse tail at 
  the base of the spine) identify the drunken figure as a 
  satyr and companion 
  of Dionysus. Here, the exhausted reveler has collapsed in fitful repose on a rock over 
  which a leopard skin, another attribute of the god, has been thrown. By 1627, 
  the statue was installed in the Palazzo Barberini, named for the cardinal who owned 
  it, the nephew of Urban VIII<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>who issued a 
  papal bull declaring that it was to remain an inalienable possession of 
  the Barberini family. </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, in 1799 the statue was sold for 4,000 <i>scudi</i> to Vincenzo 
  Pacetti, a sculptor and art dealer<i>. </i>In anticipation of reselling his 
  acquisition, the missing right leg, which earlier had been 
  constructed in plaster, was restored in marble<SPAN face="Times New Roman"></SPAN>now 
  splayed provocatively away from the body. (The figure had assumed its seated 
  posture in 1679, when the leg was placed in a more upright position.) But ownership was contested and 
  the statue again was appropriated 
  by the family, who in 1814 sold it to Ludwig I of Bavaria for twice what 
  the unrecompensed Pacettti had paid. Cheated of his possession, he contrived to 
  forestall  export from Rome, where the statue languished for six more years 
  until, after much litigation and 
  political machinations, it finally was transported to Munich and installed in the Glyptothek, 
  then being constructed to house the collection of the king, who had a room 
  designed specifically for his prize. The Faun, a masterpiece of Hellenistic 
  art dating to about 220 BC, was placed there in 1827 to await the completion 
  of the museum three years later, when it was opened to the public.</p>

      <title>Benjamin Banneker’s Broods of Cicadas</title>
      <link>https://www.historytoday.com/archive/natural-histories/benjamin-bannekers-broods-cicadas</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <section>
          
            <div><p>In the spring of 1749 Benjamin Banneker – the 17-year-old son of a freed slave – thought the world was about to be eaten whole. While working on his family’s farm in Oella, Maryland, he saw ‘thousands of locusts’ suddenly rise up from the ground and ‘creep …up the trees and bushes’, as if directed by some unseen hand. Fearing that they had come to ‘eat and destroy the fruit of the Earth, and would occasion a famine in the land’, he set about killing them as quickly as he could. But he soon realised it was pointless. There were just too many of them. Helpless, he waited with trepidation for the destruction to begin. Yet it never came and within a matter of weeks the ‘locusts’ had vanished without trace. </p>
<p>What Banneker thought were ‘locusts’ turned out to be a species of periodical cicadas (<i>Magicicada</i>) and what he had seen was just one of several gigantic ‘broods’ native to North America (Brood X). Like their European counterparts, periodical cicadas spend the vast majority of their lives underground as immature nymphs. Secreted in burrows, they feed off the xylem found in roots and generally don’t cause any bother. Once every 13 or 17 years (depending on the brood), when the temperature of the soil is just right – usually in late April or May – they clamber upwards <i>en masse</i>. When they reach the surface, they shed their outer skin and assume their adult, winged, form. The mating ritual then begins. Gathering together in ‘choruses’, the males make a high-pitched clicking sound to attract females; and for the next few weeks they reproduce with proverbial enthusiasm. Yet as soon as they have laid their eggs in the bark of trees they die, leaving their young to hide until the next great awakening. </p>
<p>Banneker was not the first person to see periodical cicadas in North America, of course. Sightings had been reported in 1633 [1634], 1666 and 1675, and brief descriptions of the insect’s life cycle had been published by Andreas Sandel and the botanist John Bartram in 1715 and 1737. Nor was Banneker the only person to remark on the 1749 emergence. Peter Kalm, a Swedish naturalist, witnessed the same brood while visiting Pennsylvania. He, too, would write a study of the cicada’s habits, albeit hedged about with caveats. But Banneker’s encounter was nevertheless to prove vital to our understanding of the cicada’s periodicity – and would mark the beginning of one of the most remarkable, if overlooked, scientific careers of the American Enlightenment. </p>

<h3><b>Auspicious return</b></h3>
<p>Banneker was born on 9 November 1731, the son of Robert and Mary Bannaka (or Bannaky). In surviving documents, Mary is described as a ‘free black’, and is most likely to have been the daughter of a black slave and a white indentured servant. Robert, by contrast, was a freed slave. Like so many others, he had been taken from Guinea and forcibly transported to Maryland to work on the tobacco plantations that were the mainstay of the colonial economy. How long he was kept in this condition is unclear, but he was fortunate to be granted his freedom just before the British authorities introduced measures to prevent slave-owners from manumitting their slaves without the legislature’s permission. </p>
<p>Despite Robert and Mary’s background, the Bannekers were moderately prosperous. In 1737, when Benjamin was six, his father purchased 100 acres of land in exchange for 7,000 lbs of tobacco and the family built a small log cabin, which stands to this day. Benjamin received little formal education. He is likely to have learned the rudiments of reading and writing from his grandmother, Molly Welsh; but whether he went on to attend a local school is unclear. If he did, it cannot have been for long. </p>
<p>Benjamin had a hunger for learning, though. Anything to do with the natural world fascinated him and his encounter with the cicadas in 1749 seems to have been instrumental in persuading him to cultivate his interest seriously. Judging by his later account, his scientific instincts were already well developed. He not only had a keen eye, but also formulated a sensible (if mistaken) hypothesis about the cicadas’ environmental impact. He even appears to have suspected that their immense numbers were key to their survival. Most tellingly, he also made a mental note not to forget what he had seen and to determine by observation when they would return. </p>
<p>From that moment on, patterns and periodicity would be an abiding preoccupation. Four years later, he tried his hand at clock-making. Captivated by the rapid pace of technological change, or – more likely – drawn to the oft-cited analogy between watchmaking and the workings of nature, he built a wooden clock of his own by copying the mechanism of a pocket watch he borrowed from a wealthy friend. For a young man with little, if any, experience of timepieces, it was nothing short of remarkable. </p>

<p>His learning was, at this stage, very much of a practical bent. Driven by curiosity, he proceeded by trial and error whenever he had a free moment. By necessity, his progress was halting and uncertain – more so after his father’s death in 1759 obliged him to assume responsibility as head of the household. But his enquiring mind continued to whir and, when the cicadas returned in 1766, he was no longer the wide-eyed <i>naïf </i>of 17 years before. This time he ‘had more sense than to endeavour to destroy them, knowing they were not so pernicious to the fruit of the Earth as I did imagine they would be’. And, being less afraid, he was able to observe them closely – more closely, in fact, than many other scientists who witnessed their appearance at the same time. For, while they were generally content to study a single resurgence and guess at their periodicity on the basis of hearsay, Banneker seems already to have realised that the only way to establish the length of their cycle for certain was to watch them over a much longer period. </p>
<p>The cicadas’ return proved auspicious. Six years after he watched them rise up in clouds from the ground, three brothers – Andrew, John, and Joseph Ellicott – bought some land not far from Banneker’s farm. Unlike most Marylanders, who were Catholic, the Ellicotts were Quakers and had little time for racial prejudices. They quickly struck up a friendship with their neighbour and, on learning that Banneker shared their passion for science, gladly lent him books with which to further his studies. </p>

<h3><b>Calculating cicadas</b></h3>
<p>Little is known of Banneker’s life in the following decades. Nothing has survived to indicate how he was affected by the Revolutionary War. But by the time the cicadas came back for a third time in 1783, just a few months before the conflict ended, Banneker had made striking progress in all his studies – and was well placed to capitalise on his talents under the new Republic. Some five years later he began studying astronomy intensively and was sufficiently skilled in mathematics that he could calculate the tides and a host of other phenomena. </p>
<p>In spring 1791 Major Andrew Ellicott – the son of Banneker’s neighbour, Joseph – was asked by Thomas Jefferson, then the Secretary of State, to survey the area earmarked for the new federal capital and he immediately invited Banneker to join his team. The extent of Banneker’s contribution to this project has, admittedly, been much debated. The evidence is ambiguous at best. But whatever his role, the mere fact of his involvement is eloquent testimony to the esteem in which his learning was beginning to be held. </p>
<p>After leaving the surveying expedition, Banneker concentrated on preparing an almanac and ephemeris for the year 1792. This contained exhaustive tables detailing ‘the Motions of the Sun and Moon, the … Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun … Age of the Moon … Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgement of the Weather’ and countless other wonders, all calculated by hand, using a series of self-derived (and remarkably complex) formulae. He showed this to his old friend Andrew Ellicott, who was so impressed that he sent it to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. Pemberton had it checked by an astronomer and, on being assured of its ‘extraordinary’ accuracy, arranged for it to be published. It met with immediate success – so much so that Banneker prepared several more editions in the years which followed. </p>
<p>At about the same time, Banneker also became committed to securing justice for African Americans. Perhaps encouraged by the Ellicotts, he wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who, in addition to being the Secretary of State, was also compromised by his involvement in the slave trade. Though he repeatedly condemned the institution of slavery, and once boasted that he wanted his slaves always to be well treated, he did not hesitate to order violent floggings and fathered six children by a slave girl. Much to Banneker’s chagrin, he also viewed slaves as being of inferior intelligence – although whether this was due to nature or nurture, he could not say. Banneker forcefully took Jefferson to task for his hypocrisy. Vilifying the Secretary for ‘detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression’, he demanded radical change. </p>
<p>Jefferson’s reply was courteous, if evasive. Perhaps stung by Banneker’s criticisms, he confined himself to vague wishes for some improvement in slaves’ living conditions. Later that same day, however, he sent a copy of Banneker’s almanac to the Marquis de Condorcet, accompanied by a note extolling his mathematical genius and hoping that such ‘eminence’ would be ‘so multiplied as to prove’ the intellectual equality of all men. </p>

<h3><b>Rising again</b></h3>
<p>Astronomy and mathematics remained Banneker’s principal interests, however, and he did not hesitate to bring them to bear on his study of the cicadas. At some point around the time he wrote to Jefferson, he compiled all the data he had so far accumulated in a note, inscribed in his ‘Astronomical Journal’. It was not long, but it was as detailed and comprehensive an account as anyone had yet written and represented the fruits of almost 50 years of study. Most important of all, it also included a prediction. Rejecting the hearsay and supposition favoured by most other scientists in favour of his past observations, he wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>They may be expected again in the year 1800, which is Seventeen years since their last appearance to me. So that if I may venture So to express it, their periodical return is Seventeen years, but they, like the Comets, make but a short stay with us … [Yet] if their lives are Short, they are merry, they begin to Sing of make a noise from the first they come out of the Earth till they die.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon proved right, Banneker’s prediction was of huge value. It established beyond doubt that Brood X followed a 17-year cycle and allowed farmers throughout the eastern United States to prepare appropriately, saving needless effort and no end of worry. </p>
<p>Seduced by the music of the stars as much as by the singing of cicadas, Banneker continued searching for patterns in nature until his death, nine years later, at the age of 78. Many of his papers were lost in a fire shortly afterwards; and, in the decades which followed, his work was largely overlooked. Thankfully, the record has recently begun to be set right, but there is still a long way to go. Given that Brood X returned only a few weeks ago – just as Banneker suggested it would – this is the perfect time to give this most remarkable of men the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of American science and justice. </p>

Our pattern recognition capabilities are a key determinant in defining intelligence. But we now live in a dystopian digital landscape purpose-built to undermine these capabilities, training us to mistake planned patterns for convenient and even meaningful coincidences. <br/></p><p>You know the drill: email a colleague about the shit weather and start getting banner ads for cheap flights to Corsica (I hear it’s nice?); google &#34;ordination license&#34; or &#34;city hall hours&#34; and watch your inbox fill with rebates for rings and cribs. For those of us who grew up during the rise of surveillance capitalism, our online experience has been defined by the effort of separating coincidence from cause-and-effect. Today we understand, if not accept, that hyper-consumption of information online comes at the cost of being hyper-<em>consumed</em>, bled by tech companies for the that data our readings secrete: You click, and the Big Five scrape a sample of your “preferences”—to exploit.<br/></p><p>The real cost to this recursive construction of reality from the ephemera of our preferences is that it tailors a separate world for each individual. <br/></p><p>And when you <em>do</em> live at the center of a private world, reverse-engineered from your own search history, you begin to notice patterns that others can’t. Believe me when I say I know what it feels like to be told that you’re the only one who sees the connection—a pattern of injustice, say—and that you’re downright crazy for noticing anything at all. To manufacture meaning from mere coincidence is the essence of paranoia, the gateway to world-building your own private conspiracies—or else to an epiphany that allows you to see the world as it actually is. <br/></p><p>I want to talk about that epiphany, about taking back control of our atomized, pre-conspiracy world. <br/></p><p><strong>2. </strong><br/></p><p>The German psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Conrad">Klaus Conrad</a> called this premonitory state <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a></em>, defined as perceiving patterns that don&#39;t actually exist and referring them back to an unseen authority who must be pulling the strings. It’s a theory he developed as an army medical officer specializing in head traumas under the Third Reich. Today, it’s analogized to political conspiracy thinking. <br/></p><p>Consider Case No. 10: a German soldier at a filling station refuses to service a patrol that doesn’t have the proper paperwork. Chalk his behavior up to that infamous Nazi officiousness, but when the patrol returns, papers in hand, the soldier still refuses to obey orders. His pattern recognition has gone into overdrive, and he’s begun to see every detail—a locked door, these patrolmen, papers signed or unsigned—as a test. His paranoid disobedience lands him in the psych ward, where Conrad writes him up as one of 107 cases that revolutionizes the Germano-sphere’s understanding of human psychology.<br/></p><p>Conrad became famous for recognizing this oppressive emergence of patterns as a pre-psychotic state that he compared to stage-fright. It culminates in a false epiphany: an <em>apophany</em> is not a flash of insight into the true nature of reality but an aha experience (literally: <em>Aha-Erlebnis</em>) that constitutes the birth of delusion. The entire universe has “turned back” and “reorganized itself” to revolve around the individual, performing and corroborating his suspicions.   <br/></p><p>Shakespeare said that all the world’s a stage. But in this case it’s staged specifically for <em>you</em>, <strong>the audience who&#39;s also the star.</strong><br/></p><p>For someone obsessed with the pathology of conspiracy, Conrad was pretty susceptible to conspiratorial thinking himself. Born in Germany and raised in Vienna, his loyalties to the Nazi Party preceded his military duty. He joined in 1940 when his earlier research in hereditary epilepsy looked like promising fodder for the Nazi&#39;s monstrous sterilization laws. Maybe it was careerist opportunism, maybe it was ideological. Or maybe it takes one delusion-obsessed man to recognize another: Hitler was one of greatest conspiracy theorists of all time. <br/></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca182d52-370f-4d1b-b985-7c6777405567_600x449.png"></a></figure></div><p>Only Conrad’s scientific findings aren’t themselves delusional. In fact he ended up being one of the only Nazi scientists to be producing science without rockets, torture, or pentagrams. The traumatized soldiers he treated on the battlefield turned out to be good data, and the hundreds of cases he worked on allowed him to work out the laws of ”Gestalt” (i.e. ‘pattern’) psychology, a school of thought that argues the human mind grasps in an instant not just individual elements of an information set, but entire configurations or patterns. For example, when we see alternating bars of light, they appear to be moving, even though they&#39;re not — our brains are just recalling patterns related to the perception of motion and applying them to stationary objects. <br/></p><p>In an apophenic state, <em>everything’s</em> a pattern. And while Conrad’s stage-model uses the analogy of starring in your own one-man show, the narcissism of living online today provides plenty more. On Instagram you can filter your face, filter out unwanted followers, construct an image that you and your peers want to believe in—you’re living a private illusion, in public, that the world reifies with likes. For-profit data collection has literally “reorganized” the world to revolve around you. As you wish it—or they will it.<br/></p><p>The true epiphany, I want to argue, is that <em>you’re </em>the one pulling the strings. Enlightenment is to realize you have more agency than your push-notifications would have you believe. <br/></p><p><strong>3.</strong><br/></p><p>Here’s a better way to think: in an apophenic, information-glutted world where you can basically find evidence for any theory you want, where people inhabit separate online realities, we should focus on <em>falsifiability</em> (which can be tested for) over supportability (which cannot). ​​​​​​​<br/></p><p>This what what the Austrian Jewish sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a>, refugee of the Holocaust in New Zealand and later England, laid out in his theory of science. Popper believed conspiracy theories are exactly what feeds a totalitarian state like Hitler’s Germany, playing on and playing up the public’s paranoia of The Other. And authoritarians get away with it precisely because their pseudoscientific claims, masquerading as sound research, are designed to be difficult to prove “false” in the heat of the moment, when data sets — not to mention a sense of the historical consequences — are necessarily incomplete. <br/></p><p>By Popper’s lights—and, I’d argue, by the intuition of basic human decency—we shouldn’t consider these provisional theories “science” at all.  <br/></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2474d564-e866-471a-9455-774fc48001b9_960x722.png"></a></figure></div><p>Popper’s a favorite in conspiracy theory studies, but I want to bring in an adjacent idea of his that I think is underemphasized in this context, which is that most human actions have unintended consequences. Instant advertising was supposed to yield informed consumers; the National Security Agency was supposed to protect &#34;us&#34; by exploiting &#34;them.&#34; These plans went horribly wrong. But once you wake up to the idea that the world has been patterned, intentionally or unintentionally, in ways you don’t agree with, you can begin to change it. </p><p><em>The conspiracy theorist will believe that institutions can be understood completely as the result of conscious design; and as collectives, he usually ascribes to them a kind of group-personality, treating them as conspiring agents, just as if they were individual men. As opposed to this view, <strong>the social theorist should recognize that the persistence of institutions and collectives creates a problem to be solved </strong>in terms of an analysis of individual social actions and their unintended (and often unwanted) social consequences, as well as their intended ones.</em><br/></p><p>Maybe I’m the deluded one for finding reason for optimism in this idea—and not only because it saves me from letting the former Nazi Conrad have the last word. Popper’s thinking offers an escape hatch from our private worlds and back into the public sphere. The social theorist is a public thinker, oriented toward improving society; the conspiracy theorist is a victim of institutions that lie beyond their control. </p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Leave a comment&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="reviewBody" id="_articlereview"><p><span>T</span><span>he lavatory facilities at Trisha’s bar, that glorious survivor of old Soho, adorned with photos of Al Capone and the pope, bear a legend written at eye level: ‘USE AS URINAL ONLY. NO SITTING.’ Except someone – I believe they are known usually as a ‘wag’ – has inserted an H into the final word, rendering it an equally familiar (and, arguably, more appropriate) piece of Anglo-Saxon. Or ought that to be Proto-Indo-European? As John McWhorter informs us in <i>Nine Nasty Words</i>, the history of that graffitied verb (though, as he points out, it can also be a noun, an adjective, a pronoun and even ‘with a bit of adjustment’ an adverb) goes back to the word <i>skei </i>–<i> </i>used by steppe dwellers of yore and meaning ‘to cut off’. It really is fascinating, the things one can learn in a lavatory.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Skei</i>’s modern-day descendant is one of nine words profiled by McWhorter in this spirited and scholarly history of profanities. As you’d expect in a work by a professor of linguistics, etymologies and tales of bastardisation form a sizeable proportion of each chapter. As is often the case, the myths are more fascinating than the actual cases of corruption of Latin, Norman or Middle English. There are people who believe that the little word found in the lavatorial corner of Trisha’s is in fact an acronym for ‘Ship High in Transit’ – relating to the seaborne transport of manure, though, as McWhorter points out, it was a word bandied merrily about by Chaucer and others long before the explosion in the guano trade.</span><span id="more-15512"></span></p>
<p><span>There are also those who hold that the slur derived from the name of a female dog (of which we have written records in English from at least 1397) stands for ‘Being in Total Control Honey’. It’s rather pleasing to imagine Lady Margaret Beaufort or Elizabeth Woodville speaking in the manner of Joan Collins. While I was aware of the erroneous etymology of the word said to be an acronym for ‘Fornicating Under Consent of King’, it was particularly wonderful to learn that this word’s first written usage came from the hand of a cleric – a monk who in 1528 used it in some marginalia to refer to his clearly disliked abbot. I can’t help </span>but think the letters page of the <i>Church Times</i> would be improved by such plain speaking, as opposed to the usual roundabout<span> passive aggression.</span></p>
<p><span>The range of sources for anecdotes such as the one above is impressive. For instance, in the chapter on the now ubiquitous ‘damn’ and ‘hell’, McWhorter quotes sources as diverse as the Pardoner in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, Captain Corcoran in <i>HMS Pinafore </i>and the opening number of <i>Legally Blonde: The Musical</i>,<i> </i>which, I learned to my edification, is entitled ‘Omigod You Guys’<i>. </i>While on the whole this is a book about the joys of well-deployed swearing, the final example did make me wonder whether blasphemy laws were such a bad thing after all.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps because this is a book about language’s colloquial use, the Americanisms within seem more noticeable than in other tomes originating on the opposite side of the Atlantic. For example, when discussing the past tense of the verb so elegantly deployed in the lavatories at Trisha’s, McWhorter asserts that the form of the verb that rhymes with ‘bat’ seems affected or ‘arch’. In this country we might associate ‘arch’ with a waspish anecdote by Noël Coward, but not, I think, with tales of self-foulage that feature a particular past participle.</span></p>
<p><span>While the chapters on the old familiar profanities are ripe with interest, the most effective sections of the book are those about words that are considered, even in a society as permissive as ours, to be truly taboo. The chapter on the word whose usage is considered so offensive that it has caused the decline of its unfortunate near-homophone ‘niggardly’ (an unrelated term from the Norse for ‘miser’) is particularly enlightening, moving even. McWhorter is equally as sensitive in his chapter on an old term for a bundle of sticks, which is now more commonly used to mean ‘cigarette’, ‘meatballish concoction’ and ‘slur for a gay man’.</span></p>
<p><span>This book reminds us that profanities are both, as McWhorter puts it, ‘fertile’ in their ability to spawn and evolve and also, more importantly, essential. Even in a society which tells itself the half-truth that it treasures ‘free speech’, there are, indeed must be, words that are beyond the pale – words that can still shock, thrill or shame. It is to be hoped that neither permissiveness nor her twin sister, puritanism, will ever truly emasculate the English language of its nastier, danglier bits. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_eff_org_deeplinks_2021_08_apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span>Apple has announced impending changes to its operating systems that include new “protections for children” features in iCloud and iMessage. If you’ve spent any time </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjwpmn/ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"><span>following the Crypto Wars</span></a><span>, you know what this means: Apple is planning to build a backdoor into its data storage system and its messaging system.</span></p>
<p><span>Child exploitation is a serious problem, and Apple isn&#39;t the first tech company to bend its privacy-protective stance in an attempt to combat it. But that choice will come at a high price for overall user privacy. Apple can </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"><span>explain at length</span></a><span> how its technical implementation will preserve privacy and security in its proposed backdoor, but at the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>To say that we are disappointed by Apple’s plans is an understatement. Apple has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/bay-area-rallies-against-fbi-threats-privacy-and-security"><span>historically been a champion</span></a><span> of end-to-end encryption, for all of the same reasons that EFF has articulated </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/dont-let-encrypted-messaging-become-hollow-promise"><span>time</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-bill-governments-not-so-secret-plan-scan-every-message-online"><span>and</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/fbi-should-stop-attacking-encryption-and-tell-congress-about-all-encrypted-phones"><span>time</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/eff-joins-32-civil-liberties-groups-and-companies-ask-obama-reject-anti-encryption"><span>again</span></a><span>. Apple’s compromise on end-to-end encryption may </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT"><span>appease government agencies</span></a><span> in the U.S. and abroad, but it is a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company’s leadership in privacy and security. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>There are two main features that the company is planning to install in every Apple device. One is a scanning feature that will scan all photos as they get uploaded into iCloud Photos to see if they match a photo in the database of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) maintained by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts—that is, accounts designated as owned by a minor—for sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received. This feature can be turned on or off by parents. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>When Apple releases these </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>“client-side scanning”</span></a><span> functionalities, users of iCloud Photos, child users of iMessage, and anyone who talks to a minor through iMessage will have to carefully consider their </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan"><span>privacy and security priorities</span></a><span> in light of the changes, and possibly be unable to safely use what until this development is one of the preeminent encrypted messengers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Apple Is Opening the Door to Broader Abuses</b></h3>
<p><span>We’ve said it </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>before</span></a><span>, and we’ll say it again now: it’s impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses.</span></p>
<p><span> That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.</span></p>
<p><span>All it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children’s, but anyone’s accounts. That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change. Take the example of India, where recently passed </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/indias-draconian-rules-internet-platforms-threaten-user-privacy-and-undermine"><span>rules</span></a><span> include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of “misinformation” in 24 hours </span><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ethiopias-hate-speech-and-disinformation-law-the-pros-the-cons-and-a-mystery/"><span>may apply to messaging services.</span></a><span> And many other countries—often those with authoritarian governments—have </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/indonesias-proposed-online-intermediary-regulation-may-be-most-repressive-yet"><span>passed</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/turkey-doubles-down-violations-digital-privacy-and-free-expression"><span>similar</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/proposed-new-internet-law-mauritius-raises-serious-human-rights-concerns"><span>laws</span></a><span>. Apple’s changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>We’ve already seen this mission creep in action. One of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/one-database-rule-them-all-invisible-content-cartel-undermines-freedom-1"><span>database of “terrorist” content</span></a><span> that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the </span><a href="https://gifct.org/"><span>Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism</span></a><span> (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/human-rights-ngos-in-coalition-letter-to-gifct/"><span>calls from civil society</span></a><span>. While it’s therefore impossible to know whether the database has overreached, we do know that platforms </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content"><span>regularly flag critical content</span></a> <span>as “terrorism,” including documentation of violence and repression, counterspeech, art, and satire. <br/></span></p>
<h3><b>Image Scanning on iCloud Photos: A Decrease in Privacy<br/></b></h3>
<p><span>Apple’s plan for scanning photos that get uploaded into iCloud Photos is similar in some ways to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/dont-let-encrypted-messaging-become-hollow-promise"><span>Microsoft’s PhotoDNA</span></a><span>. The main product difference is that Apple’s scanning will happen on-device. The (unauditable) database of processed CSAM images will be distributed in the operating system (OS), the processed images transformed so that users cannot see what the image is, and matching done on those transformed images using private set intersection where the device will not know whether a match has been found. This means that when the features are rolled out, a version of the NCMEC CSAM database will be uploaded onto every single iPhone. The result of the matching will be sent up to Apple, but Apple can only tell that matches were found once a sufficient number of photos have matched a preset threshold.</span></p>
<p><span>Once a certain number of photos are detected, the photos in question will be sent to human reviewers within Apple, who determine that the photos are in fact part of the CSAM database. If confirmed by the human reviewer, those photos will be sent to NCMEC, and the user’s account disabled. Again, the bottom line here is that whatever privacy and security aspects are in the technical details, all photos uploaded to iCloud will be scanned.</span></p>
<p><span>Make no mistake: this is a decrease in privacy for all iCloud Photos users, not an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, although Apple holds the keys to view Photos stored in iCloud Photos, it does not scan these images. Civil liberties organizations have </span><a href="https://fixitalready.eff.org/apple"><span>asked the company</span></a><span> to remove its ability to do so. But Apple is choosing the opposite approach and giving itself </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> knowledge of users’ content.</span></p>
<h3><b>Machine Learning and Parental Notifications in iMessage: A Shift Away From Strong Encryption<br/></b></h3>
<p><span>Apple’s second main new feature is two kinds of notifications based on scanning photos sent or received by iMessage. To implement these notifications, Apple will be rolling out an on-device machine learning classifier designed to detect “sexually explicit images.” According to Apple, these features will be limited (at launch) to U.S. users under 18 who have been enrolled in a </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/families-and-kids"><span>Family Account</span></a><span>. In these new processes, if an account held by a child under 13 wishes to send an image that the on-device machine learning classifier determines is a sexually explicit image, a notification will pop up, telling the under-13 child that their parent will be notified of this content. If the under-13 child still chooses to send the content, they have to accept that the “parent” will be notified, and the image will be irrevocably saved to the parental controls section of their phone for the parent to view later. For users between the ages of 13 and 17, a similar warning notification will pop up, though without the parental notification. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, if the under-13 child </span><i><span>receives</span></i><span> an image that iMessage deems to be “sexually explicit”, before being allowed to view the photo, a notification will pop up that tells the under-13 child that their parent will be notified that they are receiving a sexually explicit image. Again, if the under-13 user accepts the image, the parent is notified and the image is saved to the phone. Users between 13 and 17 years old will similarly receive a warning notification, but a notification about this action will not be sent to their parent’s device. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>This means that if—for instance—a minor using an iPhone without these features turned on sends a photo to another minor who does have the features enabled, they do not receive a notification that iMessage considers their image to be “explicit” or that the recipient’s parent will be notified. The recipient’s parents will be informed of the content without the sender consenting to their involvement. Additionally, once sent or received, the “sexually explicit image” cannot be deleted from the under-13 user’s device.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether sending or receiving such content, the under-13 user has the option to decline without the parent being notified. Nevertheless, these notifications give the sense that Apple is watching over the user’s shoulder—and in the case of under-13s, that’s essentially what Apple has given parents the ability to do.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>These notifications give the sense that Apple is watching over the user’s shoulder—and in the case of under-13s, that’s essentially what Apple has given parents the ability to do.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>It is also important to note that Apple has chosen to use the notoriously </span><a href="https://facctconference.org/2021/acceptedpapers.html"><span>difficult-to-audit</span></a><span> technology of machine learning classifiers to determine what constitutes a sexually explicit image. We know from years of documentation and research that machine-learning technologies, used without human oversight, have a habit of wrongfully classifying content, including supposedly “sexually explicit” content. When blogging platform Tumblr </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/dear-tumblr-banning-adult-content-wont-make-your-site-better-it-will-harm-sex"><span>instituted a filter for sexual content</span></a><span> in 2018, it famously caught all sorts of other imagery in the net, including pictures of Pomeranian puppies, selfies of fully-clothed individuals, and more. Facebook’s attempts to police nudity have resulted in the removal of pictures of famous statues such as Copenhagen’s </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/12081589/Copenhagen-Little-Mermaid-statue-Facebook-accused-of-censoring-photo.html"><span>Little Mermaid</span></a><span>. These filters have a history of chilling expression, and there’s plenty of reason to believe that Apple’s will do the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the detection of a “sexually explicit image” will be using on-device machine learning to scan the contents of messages, Apple will no longer be able to honestly call iMessage “end-to-end encrypted.” Apple and its proponents may argue that scanning before or after a message is encrypted or decrypted keeps the “end-to-end” promise intact, but that would be semantic maneuvering to cover up a tectonic shift in the company’s stance toward strong encryption. <br/></span></p>
<h3><b>Whatever Apple Calls It, It’s No Longer Secure Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span>As a reminder, a secure messaging system is a system where no one but the user and their intended recipients can read the messages or otherwise analyze their contents to infer what they are talking about. Despite messages passing through a server, an end-to-end encrypted message will not allow the server to know the contents of a message. When that same server has a channel for revealing information about the contents of a significant portion of messages, that’s not end-to-end encryption. In this case, while Apple will never see the images sent or received by the user, it has still created the classifier that scans the images that would provide the notifications to the parent. Therefore, it would now be possible for Apple to add new training data to the classifier sent to users’ devices or send notifications to a wider audience, easily censoring and chilling speech.</span></p>
<p><span>But even without such expansions, this system will give parents who do not have the best interests of their children in mind one more way to monitor and control them, limiting the internet’s potential for expanding the world of those whose lives would otherwise be restricted. And because family sharing plans may be organized by abusive partners, it&#39;s not a stretch to imagine using this feature as </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/fighting-disciplinary-technologies"><span>a form of stalkerware</span></a><span>. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>People have the right to communicate privately without backdoors or censorship, including when those people are minors. Apple should make the right decision: keep these backdoors off of users’ devices.</span></p>

      <p>Joseph Allen runs a major public health research project at Harvard University, probing how indoor air quality affects human health and cognition. He consults with companies on ventilation and air filtration, and during the pandemic he became a prominent voice on public health, writing dozens of op-eds criticizing early guidance from health authorities and debunking misconceptions about how the virus spreads. But none of it would have happened if he hadn’t washed out as an FBI recruit.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City homicide detective who opened his own investigative agency, Allen spent his teens and 20s helping with the family business. He did surveillance, undercover work, computer forensics, and skiptrace—tracking down people who left town to avoid alimony. Eventually he took over the agency, leading investigations and supervising eight agents.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the work and thought it was challenging,” Allen recalls. But part of him always wanted to be a scientist. He majored in environmental science at Boston College, and in his late 20s, still torn, he began to apply to graduate school even as he started the process to become an FBI agent. After 2 years of interviews and testing, the last step was a routine polygraph test. He failed the first round—the trick questions he was asked were so obvious that he could not take them seriously. So FBI flew in one of its toughest examiners from Iraq—a hulking, jackbooted guy who got right in Allen’s face, screaming that he knew he was lying. But Allen kept cool, and after a while, the interrogator stormed out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>“I thought he would come back in the room and say, ‘Congratulations,’ cause I’m thinking I’m crushing it,” Allen recalls. “But they failed me because they said I employed countermeasures.” FBI apparently didn’t want an agent who couldn’t be unnerved by a polygraph test. And that solved Allen’s career dilemma. “I guarantee I’m the only public health student ever to fail an FBI lie detector polygraph in the morning and start graduate school a few hours later,” Allen says. But his investigative instincts never left him.</p>

<p>A tall, athletic-looking man with a bald head and stylish stubble, Allen directs the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he studies the effects of toxic gases emitted from furniture, carpets, and paints; stale air; and high levels of carbon dioxide. Years of studies by Allen and others have shown poorly circulated air in buildings impairs our ability to think clearly and creatively. Considering that we spend more than 90% of our lifetimes indoors, those findings have implications for personal well-being—and for businesses concerned about their bottom line.</p>

<p>“Joe has always had a unique understanding of this range of domains—from how buildings work, to environmental exposure assessment, to making connections with health outcomes,” says Brent Stephens, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “There’s not a tremendous number of people in this world that have worked on that whole spectrum.”</p>

<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, the previously esoteric field of indoor air quality suddenly became the focus of widespread concern. Like many of his colleagues, Allen jumped into the fray, advising school systems, police departments, entertainment companies, the Boston Symphony, and a host of other entities on how to make their indoor air healthier, during the pandemic and afterward.</p>

<p>“COVID really changed the conversation,” says Matt Murray, vice president of leasing at Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded developer in the United States and one of Allen’s consulting clients. Before the pandemic, the company would have to explain to bored executives why they should pay attention to indoor air. “Now, the CEOs are all saying, ‘What filters do you use? How you process the air you bring into the workspace?’” Murray says. “And we’re ready for those conversations because we’ve been working with Joe.”</p>

<p><span>After he failed</span> his FBI exam, Allen became a different kind of sleuth. For his doctoral thesis at the Boston University School of Public Health, he investigated toxic flame-retardant chemicals released into the air by furniture, and found they were nearly ubiquitous. (The chemicals were later banned.) After graduation he got a job with a consulting firm, where he investigated problems such as toxic emissions from drywall and outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, which is caused by bacteria that grow in plumbing and become aerosolized by ventilation systems, showers, or even flushed toilets. Those investigations introduced him to “sick building syndrome,” a problem first identified in the 1970s in which the occupants experience fatigue, itchy eyes, headaches, and other symptoms. Exactly what causes these ailments isn’t clear, but exposure to contaminated air is a likely culprit. Allen became convinced that the building you work in can have more impact on your health than your doctor.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>In 2014, Allen accepted a position at Harvard, where he soon turned his attention to how the indoor environment can affect people’s cognitive abilities. Many of us have struggled to pay attention during a long staff meeting in a stuffy conference room. Research by Allen and others suggests that lassitude may not be due solely to boredom, but also to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-rich conference room air.</p>

<p>Ever since the energy shocks of the 1970s, buildings in the United States have been made as airtight and energy-efficient as possible. The result was a buildup of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. “Green building standards” introduced in the late ’90s focused on reducing toxic materials and making buildings healthier as well as more sustainable, but they didn’t prioritize indoor air quality and ultimately did little to improve it.</p>

<p>In a multiyear series of experiments, Allen and his team have investigated the consequences. In the first study, published in 2015, they had 24 white-collar volunteers spend six working days in environmentally controlled office spaces at Syracuse University’s Total Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. On various days the experimenters would alter ventilation rates and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs. Each afternoon the volunteers were tested on their ability to think analytically and react to a crisis. (One test, for example put the volunteer in the role of a small-town mayor trying to react to an emergency.) All tests were double-blind: Neither the volunteers nor the study personnel knew that day’s environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The results were dramatic. When volunteers worked in well-ventilated conditions (which lowered the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs), they scored 61% higher than when they worked in typical office building conditions. When they worked in the cleanest conditions, with even lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels and higher ventilation rates, their scores climbed 101%.</p>

<p>To find out whether the results held up in the real world, Allen and his team recruited 109 volunteers from 10 office buildings across the United States. Six had been renovated to create better heat and humidity control, improve ventilation, and lower the use of toxic materials. Four had not. Allen’s team gave each office worker a Fitbit-like bracelet to record heart rate, skin temperature, sleep patterns, and other physiological signs of well-being. Workers also completed a survey each day about how comfortable they felt and whether they experienced symptoms such as drowsiness or headaches. At the end of the week, they took the cognitive tests. Workers in the buildings with good ventilation and lower levels of indoor pollution scored 26.4% higher than those in the unimproved buildings. They also reported sleeping better and experiencing fewer “sick building” symptoms.</p>

      <p>“This is really important, interesting work,” says Elliott Gall, an indoor air scientist at Portland State University. “It’s a great example of the kind of interdisciplinary work [that explores] the complexity of indoor air and how it affects us.”</p>

<p>Over time, Allen came to see businesspeople as natural allies who could act on his public health findings faster than government officials. He teamed up with John Macomber, a Harvard Business School lecturer and former CEO of one of the largest construction companies in New England. Macomber was impressed with Allen’s research suggesting a tiny sacrifice in energy efficiency through improved ventilation could increase a business’s bottom line by as much as 10% by decreasing absenteeism and boosting worker productivity. “I realized we’ve been missing the boat,” Macomber says. “We’re chasing pennies on energy when there’s thousands of dollars in productivity issues.”</p>

<p>Allen and Macomber consulted with companies and spoke at corporate conferences, making the economic case for improving ventilation and filtration as well as adjusting lighting, temperature, and humidity. “The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated,” they wrote in a book they co-authored, <em>Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity</em>. “There are just a handful of things we need to do to make a building healthier.”</p>

<p>Allen’s group continued to investigate how the indoor environment affects our mental state. They found that airline pilots exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> levels common in cockpits did worse on Federal Aviation Administration–mandated emergency response tests than when they breathed better air. They showed that during a heat wave, students who lived in non–air-conditioned dorms had slower reaction times and poorer problem-solving skills than those with air conditioning. They showed that bringing plants and views of nature into the workplace can lower office workers’ heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological indicators of stress.</p>

<p>In 2019, Allen’s team embarked on an ambitious international project to examine the long-term impacts of indoor air quality by tracking the physical and cognitive health of more than 300 office workers in 43 buildings in six countries over the course of 1 year. They mailed each worker a wristband to monitor their physiology and a small sensor to continuously measure levels of fine particulates and CO<sub>2</sub> in their workspace. At predetermined times and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and particulates, the program pinged each worker’s smartphone with a quiz to test reaction time and cognitive function. The studies showed that in offices across the world, poor ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub>, and particulates (which carry VOCs) conspire to significantly impair cognitive function.</p>

<p><span>When the first reports</span> of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Allen realized his years researching air quality and disease transmission in indoor environments had new relevance. “Even though the virus was novel, there are elements in all this that feel quite familiar,” he says. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a radiological hazard, biological hazard, or chemical hazard. We know how to assess the risk and put in appropriate controls.”</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) latched onto the idea that the virus was spread by large, exhaled droplets that float for a short time and then settle on surfaces. But scientists specializing in aerosols knew airborne viruses are more likely to ride on tinier particles exhaled when people breathe, sneeze, cough, or talk. Smaller than 5 microns, these particles can travel across a room and linger in indoor air for hours.</p>

<p>Aerosol experts such as Lidia Morawska of Australia’s Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point; Donald Milton of the University of Maryland, College Park; and Linsey Marr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the focus on larger droplets had led to wrong-headed guidance about washing packages with bleach, staying 2 meters apart—even outdoors—and other forms of what some researchers called “hygiene theater.” They urged policies that emphasized indoor mask wearing and less draconian regulations for people outdoors, where the virus would quickly disperse.</p>

<p>Allen signed on to that fight, collaborating with aerosol experts and public health researchers on scientific papers and bringing their case to the public. “He’s a really good public communicator,” says Marr, who credits Allen with helping her work get the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>“One of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on,” Allen says. “Even by late January 2020 we knew that airborne transmission of aerosols was not only likely, but probable.” Waiting for proof made no sense. “This was a pandemic, an all-in moment, so why wouldn’t we have immediately deployed every strategy that could have helped?” Those strategies, Allen knew from his research, include bringing more outside air into chronically underventilated buildings and using higher efficiency filters in ventilation units.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>One of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>He started waking up at 4 a.m. to write opinion pieces. His first two, in the <em>Financial Times </em>and <em>The New York Times</em>, argued that buildings, if properly ventilated, could be formidable weapons in the fight against the virus. He and his team had measured air flow in schoolrooms under various conditions, and Allen explained that schools could easily be made safe by opening windows and buying the kind of high-efficiency particulate air purifiers sold at local home stores.</p>

<p>So much of his writing involved correcting misimpressions that he felt he was playing editorial whack-a-mole. No, he argued, you do not have to wipe your groceries with bleach. No, you do not have to avoid exercising outside. No, schools do not need to install costly air-purifying systems.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Morawska and Milton wrote an open letter to WHO—a full-throated appeal to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission. Allen was among 237 other scientists in 32 countries who signed on to the letter, which urged greater emphasis on indoor air quality. But WHO continued to downplay the importance of aerosol transmission. “I think some of the reluctance was that if [health authorities] say a disease is airborne, we’d have to provide N95 masks for every health worker and have negative pressure rooms in every hospital, which wasn’t possible,” Marr says.</p>

<p>Later that month, Allen and his Harvard colleague Parham Azimi published a study in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>that used computer modeling to reconstruct the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak on the <em>Diamond Princess </em>cruise ship. By mapping the ship’s ventilation system and the locations of people who came down with the disease, they showed that only aerosols, not larger droplets, could have traveled the necessary distances through the ducts. Similar findings emerged from studies by Marr, Morawska, and others.</p>

<p>Finally, in early May, after a series of persuasive papers in major journals, WHO and CDC acknowledged that the virus was transmitted primarily by fine aerosols. (Even then, the agencies issued no major announcements but simply changed the wording on their websites.) Since then, CDC has gone further, issuing recommendations for reopening schools that stress the importance of good ventilation in addition to vaccinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen and his colleagues at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program created a website with a comprehensive guide to maintaining proper ventilation in schools, homes, and businesses. The website advises building managers to bring in as much outside air as possible—a room air exchange rate of four to six times per hour, more than double the rate in a typical office or school building. In buildings that recirculate interior air, managers should upgrade to hospital-grade MERV 13 filters, which remove up to 90% of particles 2.5 microns or smaller, rather than the typical MERV 8, which can remove as little as 20%.</p>

<p>The new focus on indoor air quality could help hasten the end of the current pandemic and perhaps even help forestall the next one. It may bring broader changes as well. Businesspeople are recognizing the value of improving indoor air to create better working conditions and add value to their properties. “What we’re seeing with some parts of the market—notably the higher end, real estate investment trusts, owners of multiple office buildings or apartments—is they’re thinking really hard about competing” in the post pandemic market, Macomber says. “And one way to compete is to have healthier buildings.”</p>

<p>Allen predicts that the new availability of cheap personal air quality monitors will quicken that competition and heighten people’s awareness of the indoor environment. Previously, the only way to assess indoor air quality was to hire an expensive consultant. Now, with monitors available online for less than a couple of hundred dollars, any office worker or hotel guest can quickly monitor CO<sub>2</sub>; some devices even detect VOCs. If consumers post results on websites like Yelp, businesses would be forced to pay attention. (Indeed, some building owners already boast about air quality in advertisements.)</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a fundamental rebalancing in terms of how we think about indoor spaces,” Allen says. “I think that people won’t tolerate sick buildings, where you feel tired, your eyes itch, you have a headache, or you’re stuffed into a closetlike office with no windows.” It’s one lasting positive from the pandemic. “That era is over,” Allen says. “Rightly so, and good riddance.”</p>

	<p>Postgres.app is a full-featured PostgreSQL installation packaged as a standard Mac app.
It includes everything you need to get started:
we’ve even included popular extensions like <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> for geo data and <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">plv8</a> for JavaScript.</p>

<p>Postgres.app has a beautiful user interface and a convenient menu bar item.
You never need to touch the command line to use it – but of course we do include all the necessary <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">command line tools</a> and header files for advanced users.</p>

<p>Postgres.app can install minor updates automatically, so you get bugfixes as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="installing-postgresapp">Installing Postgres.app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Download   ➜   Move to Applications folder   ➜   Double Click</p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t move Postgres.app to the Applications folder, you will see a warning about an unidentified developer and won&#39;t be able to open it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click &#34;Initialize&#34; to create a new server</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Configure your <tt>$PATH</tt> to use the included command line tools (optional):</p>
		<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &amp;&amp;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Done! You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with these default settings:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>Host</td>
		<td>localhost</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Port</td>
		<td>5432</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User</td>
		<td>your system user name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database</td>
		<td>same as user</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>none</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Connection URL</td>
		<td>postgresql://localhost</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To connect with psql, double click a database. To connect directly from the command line, type <code>psql</code>. If you’d rather use a graphical client, see below.</p>

<p>NOTE: These instructions assume that you’ve never installed PostgreSQL on your Mac before.
If you have previously installed PostgreSQL using homebrew, MacPorts, the EnterpriseDB installer, consider <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/remove.html">removing other PostgreSQL installations</a> first.
We also have <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/update.html">instructions for upgrading from older versions of Postgres.app</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphical-clients">Graphical Clients</h2>

<p>Postgres.app includes <code>psql</code>, a versatile command line client for PostgreSQL.
But it’s not the only option; there are plenty of great graphical clients available for PostgreSQL.
Two popular tools are:</p>

<ul>
	<li id="pgadmin"><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a></li>
	<li id="postico"><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a> is a feature rich open source PostgreSQL client.
It has support for almost every feature in PostgreSQL.
The only downside is that the cross-plattform UI really doesn’t live up to the expectations of a native Mac app.</p>

<p><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> on the other hand, is a very modern Mac app.
It’s made by the same people that maintain Postgres.app, and we think you’ll like it! 
We put a lot of effort into making it a joy to use.
However, it doesn’t have the extensive feature set of pgAdmin, and it’s a commercial app rather than open source.</p>

<p>Aside from those two options, there are a lot more to choose from! Check the documentation for a <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/gui-tools.html">list of amazing Mac apps for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-connect">How to connect</h2>

<p>After your PostgreSQL server is up and running, you’ll probably want to connect to it from your application.
Here’s how to connect to PostgreSQL from popular programming languages and frameworks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">PHP</dt>
	<dd>
			<p>
				To connect from PHP, make sure that it supports PostgreSQL.
				The version included with macOS doesn&#39;t support PostgreSQL.
				We recommend <a href="https://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for an easy way to install a current version of PHP that works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use PDO (object oriented):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$db = new PDO(&#39;pgsql:host=localhost&#39;);
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
$statement-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[&#34;datname&#34;]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				Or the <tt>pg_connect()</tt> functions (procedural):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$conn = pg_connect(&#34;host=localhost&#34;);
$result = pg_query($conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[0]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Python</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			To connect to a PostgreSQL server with Python, please first install the psycopg2 library:
		</p>
		<pre><code>
pip install psycopg2
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Django</h3>
		<p>In your settings.py, add an entry to your DATABASES setting:</p>
		<pre><code>
DATABASES = {
    &#34;default&#34;: {
        &#34;ENGINE&#34;: &#34;django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2&#34;,
        &#34;NAME&#34;: &#34;[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;,
        &#34;USER&#34;: &#34;[YOUR_USER_NAME]&#34;,
        &#34;PASSWORD&#34;: &#34;&#34;,
        &#34;HOST&#34;: &#34;localhost&#34;,
        &#34;PORT&#34;: &#34;&#34;,
    }
}
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Flask</h3>
		<p>When using the <a href="https://packages.python.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a> extension you can add to your application code:</p>
		<pre><code>
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = &#39;postgresql://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#39;
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>SQLAlchemy</h3>
		<pre><code>
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(&#39;postgresql://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#39;)
		</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Ruby</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>To install the pg gem, make sure you have set up your <tt>$PATH</tt> correctly (see <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">Command-Line Tools</a>), then execute the following command:</p>
		<pre><code>sudo ARCHFLAGS=&#34;-arch x86_64&#34; gem install pg</code></pre>
		
		<h3>Rails</h3>
		<p>In config/database.yml, use the following settings:</p>
		<pre><code>
development:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: [YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]
    host: localhost
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Sinatra</h3>
		<p>In config.ru or your application code:</p>
		<pre><code>
set :database, &#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;
		</code></pre>
		<h3>ActiveRecord</h3>
		<p>Install the activerecord gem and require &#39;active_record&#39;, and establish a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(&#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>DataMapper</h3>
		<p>Install and require the datamapper and do_postgres gems, and create a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
DataMapper.setup(:default, &#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Sequel</h3>
		<p>Install and require the sequel gem, and create a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
DB = Sequel.connect(&#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Java</dt>
	<dd>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Download and install the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html">PostgreSQL JDBC driver</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Connect to the JDBC URL <tt>jdbc:postgresql://localhost</tt>
			</li>

	<dd>
		<p>
			libpq is the native C client library for connecting to PostgreSQL. It&#39;s really easy to use:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#include &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;
int main() {
    PGconn *conn = PQconnectdb(&#34;postgresql://localhost&#34;);
    if (PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_OK) {
        PGresult *result = PQexec(conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; PQntuples(result); i++) {
            char *value = PQgetvalue(result, i, 0);
            if (value) printf(&#34;%s\n&#34;, value);
        }
        PQclear(result);
    }
    PQfinish(conn);
}</code></pre>
		<p>Now compile the file with clang and run it:</p>
		<pre><code>clang main.c -I$(pg_config --includedir) -L$(pg_config --libdir) -lpq
./a.out</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Swift</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			You can just use the C API in Swift! First include libpq in your bridging header:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#import &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>
			Then make sure to link with libpq.
		</p>
		<p>
			On iOS, you&#39;ll need to build libpq yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			On macOS you can use the system provided libpq (does not support SSL) or use libpq provided by Postgres.app
			by adding the following build settings:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tbody><tr>
				<th>Other Linker Flags</th>
				<td><tt>-lpq</tt></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Header Search Paths</th>
				<td><tt>/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/include</tt></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Library Search Paths</th>
				<td><tt>/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/lib</tt></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p>
			Now you can use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq C library</a> to connect to PostgreSQL:
		</p>
		<pre><code>let conn = PQconnectdb(&#34;postgresql://localhost&#34;.cString(using: .utf8))
if PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_OK {
    let result = PQexec(conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn&#34;)
    for i in 0 ..&lt; PQntuples(result) {
        guard let value = PQgetvalue(result, i, 0) else { continue }
        let dbname = String(cString: value)
        print(dbname)
    }
    PQclear(result)
}
PQfinish(conn)</code></pre>
	</dd>
</dl>

      <p>People are using LÖVR for game jams, commercial projects, tools, education, and VR/3D/2D prototyping. Some daring souls have even embedded LÖVR inside of Unity, ported the engine to other languages, and gotten it running on tiny microcontrollers. With the power of LÖVR, you can turn virtually any idea into reality.</p>

<p>
Last month I not-at-all-subtly hinted that a certain long-awaited feature was
arriving imminently. At this point, I think it’s a good idea to set the tone for the rest of
this post.
</p>


<figure id="orge63195c">

<div id="outline-container-citations">
<h2 id="citations">Citations<a aria-hidden="true" href="#citations">#</a> </h2>
<div id="text-citations">
<p>
After <i>years</i> of (on and off) discussion<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, I am elated to be able to present
Org’s new native citation syntax. Org has grown a thoroughly designed, modular,
capable citation system. At last you can refer to Org for all your attribution
needs. Special thanks must go to Nicolas Goaziou for leading the charge, John
Kitchin for paving the way with the <kbd>org-ref</kbd> package, Bruce D’Arcus for driving a
lot of careful consideration of design decisions and starting to document some
of the details — and the many other denizens of the mailing list who have
contributed to the discussion over the years.
</p>

<p>
András Simonyi’s also deserves a special mention for his work creating the Elisp
<span>CSL</span> library <code>Citeproc.el</code>, which while not directly included in Org is crucial to
providing robust <span>CSL</span> support, and integrates with <kbd>oc-csl.el</kbd>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-outline">
<h3 id="outline">Outline<a aria-hidden="true" href="#outline">#</a> </h3>
<div id="text-outline">
<p>
Citations have been carefully designed in such a way that users and Elisp
tinkerers will be able to easily adapt and extend it to fit their needs.
To that end, Org Cite (or <span>OC</span> for short) has been split into two halves:
</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>oc.el</kbd> which defines the syntax and provides some machinery to interact with
citations</li>
<li>Citation processors which interface with <kbd>oc.el</kbd> to produce nicely-formatted
citations to be inserted in your bibliography, within the text, and even
rendered in the buffer<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are four capabilities that Org Cite uses the processors for
</p>
<ol>
<li>Inserting and editing citations</li>
<li>Following citations to their definition</li>
<li>Fontifying the citations in the buffer</li>
<li>Exporting the citations</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each capability can have a particular citation processor assigned, independently
of the others. Out of the box, Org uses the <kbd>basic</kbd> processor for all of these tasks.
</p>

<p>
The <kbd>basic</kbd> citation processor is one of four currently bundled with Org:
</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>basic</kbd>, which has no dependencies and provides all four capabilities. It export
to all formats, but only provides very simple citations.</li>
<li><kbd>biblatex</kbd> and <kbd>natbib</kbd>, which provide the export capability to create citations
via <a href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">Biber</a> and (to a lesser extent) <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib">natbib</a>, but only for LaTeX.</li>
<li><kbd>csl</kbd>, which provides the export capability using the <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a>,
and exports to <span>HTML</span>, LaTeX, Org, and plain text (with an <a href="https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el/issues/23">open issue</a> for <span>ODT</span>)
— but depends on <a href="https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el">citeproc.el</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This provides a solid foundation for other packages to build off, and despite
Org Cite being yet to be released or documented in the manual we are already
seeing the development of packages like <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref-cite">org-ref-cite</a> (by John Kitchin).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-basic-usage">
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic usage<a aria-hidden="true" href="#basic-usage">#</a> </h3>
<div id="text-basic-usage">
<p>
To get started with Org Cite, we must have some form of bibliography.
This can either be a BibTeX file or a <span>CSL</span>-<span>JSON</span> file.
</p>

<p>
As an example, say we have a file <kbd>orgcite.bib</kbd> containing the following
</p>
<details id="basic-usage,code--1" open=""><summary><span>bibtex</span></summary>
    <p><a href="#basic-usage,code--1">#</a>
        </p>
    <div>
<pre><span>@article</span>{<span>OrgCitations</span>,
         <span>author</span>={org, mode and Syntax, Citation and List, Mailing and Effort, Time},
         <span>journal</span>={Journal of Plain Text Formats},
         <span>title</span>={Elegant Citations with Org-Mode},
         <span>year</span>={2021},
         <span>month</span>={7},
         <span>volume</span>={42},
         <span>number</span>={1},
         <span>pages</span>={2-3}}
</pre>
</div>
    </details>

<p>
First we need to let Org know about this bibliography file (which must have a
<kbd>.bib</kbd>, <kbd>.bibtex</kbd>, or <kbd>.json</kbd> extension), which we do either via the <kbd>#+bibliography</kbd>
keyword, or the variable <code>org-cite-global-bibliography</code>.
</p>
<details id="org46a0f53" open="">
    <summary></summary>
    <p><a href="#org46a0f53">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org46a0f53">#+bibliography: orgcite.bib
</pre>

    </details>

<p>
Once you have a bibliography source, you can start referencing to your heart’s
content! The basic citation syntax is as follows:
</p>


<figure id="org885d4cd">


<figcaption><span>Figure 1: </span>The new citation syntax, for simple citations</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Using the default style <kbd>[cite:@OrgCitations]</kbd> produces (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">org et al. 2021</a>). For
more information on the styles currently available, see <a href="#cite-styles">1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to insert a bibliography somewhere, we just need to insert the
<kbd>#+print_bibliography</kbd> keyword, like so:
</p>

<details id="org5a01060" open="">
    <summary></summary>
    <p><a href="#org5a01060">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org5a01060">#+print_bibliography:
</pre>

    </details>

<div id="org60ba89a">
<div>
  <p><a id="citeproc_bib_item_1"></a>org, mode, Citation Syntax, Mailing List, and Time Effort. 2021. “Elegant Citations with Org-Mode.” <i>Journal of Plain Text Formats</i> 42 (1):2–3.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
So, to summarise, all one needs to get started is:
</p>
<details id="org21e87b4" open="">
    <summary></summary>
    <p><a href="#org21e87b4">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org21e87b4">#+bibliography: references.bib
[cite:@key]
#+print_bibliography:
</pre>

    </details>
<p>
That’s it! 🎉
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-cite-syntax">
<h3 id="cite-syntax">The cite syntax<a aria-hidden="true" href="#cite-syntax">#</a> </h3>
<div id="text-cite-syntax">
<p>
Don’t let the simplicity in the examples above fool you, the new syntax is quite
capable of expressing more complex forms. Here’s the <i>full</i> version of the new
cite syntax:
</p>


<figure id="org4b52bc4">


<figcaption><span>Figure 2: </span>The new citations syntax, in full</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The <b>style</b> and <b>variant</b> determine what form the exported citation takes</li>
<li>The <b>common prefix</b> and <b>suffix</b> and put at the start and end of the generated
citation, respectively</li>
<li>The citation <b>key</b> refers to a Bib(La)TeX or <span>CSL</span>-<span>JSON</span> key
<ul>
<li>The citation <b>prefix</b> and <b>suffix</b> are put before and after the reference to the
key</li>
<li>Some citation processors recognise locators, which refer to a particular
part of the work, for example: <kbd>p. 7</kbd> to refer to page 7.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the default <span>CSL</span> citation style (Chicago author-name) <kbd>[cite/l/b:see
@OrgCitations pp. 7 for fun]</kbd> becomes see <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">org et al. 2021, 7</a> for fun.
</p>

<p>
The citation styles and variants, and recognised locators are handled by the
citation processors. Org cite’s bundled processors currently supports the
following citation styles.

<p>
The style of the citations and the bibliography depend on three things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The citation processor used</li>
<li>The citation style</li>
<li>The bibliography style</li>
</ol>

<p>
The citation processor is automatically selected based on
<code>org-cite-export-processors</code> based on the export format being used, but can be set
on a per-document basis via the <kbd>#+cite_export</kbd> keyword. Here, I shall use the <kbd>csl</kbd>
processor,
</p>
<details id="org7c0a657" open="">

    <p><a href="#org7c0a657">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org7c0a657">#+cite_export: csl
</pre>

    </details>

<p>
With <code>org-cite-export-processors</code>, you can also set the bibliography and citation
style by giving a triplet of parameters <code><span>(</span>PROCESSOR BIBLIOGRAPHY-STYLE CITATION-STYLE<span>)</span></code> instead of just the processor. You can also use this triplet of
values with the <kbd>#+cite_export</kbd> keyword
</p>
<details id="org6fc9b21" open="">

    <p><a href="#org6fc9b21">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org6fc9b21">#+cite_export: processor bibliography-style citation-style
</pre>

    </details>

<p>
There are also some more options about how the bibliography is produced. These
options are handled by the active citation processor. For example, while the <span>CSL</span>
processor does not currently support any options, the BibLaTeX processor passes
options to a <code><span><span><span><span><span>\</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>printbibliography</span></span></span></span></code> command, allowing for the
following:
</p>
<details id="org8cd0a12" open="">

<a href="https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el">Citeproc</a> is currently available on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/citeproc"><span>MELPA</span></a>, and so can be installed via your
package manager of choice so long as <span>MELPA</span> is included in your
<code>package-archives</code>. When available, it will be automatically loaded by
<kbd>oc-csl.el</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
It currently supports exporting to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HTML</span></li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>Org</li>
<li>Plain text</li>
</ul>

<p>
Should you be interested in other formats, know that Citeproc is designed to
easily support adding new formats (see <kbd>citeproc-formatters.el</kbd> for examples).
</p>

<p>
Citeproc can currently retrieve bibliographic information from the following
formats:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CSL</span>-<span>JSON</span></li>
<li>Bib(La)TeX</li>
<li>org-bibtex</li>
</ul>

<p>
Though support for Bib(La)TeX and <a href="https://gewhere.github.io/org-bibtex">org-bibtex</a> is rudimentary compared to <span>CSL</span>-<span>JSON</span>.
</p>

<p>
When exporting, you can set the style by providing a path to <span>CSL</span> style files,
either absolute or relative to <code>org-cite-csl-styles-dir</code>. For example, if I
download <kbd>apa.csl</kbd> I can use it like so:
</p>
<details id="org7f44fa9" open="">
    <summary></summary>
    <p><a href="#org7f44fa9">#</a>
        </p>
    <pre id="org7f44fa9">#+cite_export: csl ~/Downloads/apa.csl
</pre>

    </details>

<p>
When no style is given <code>org-cite-csl--fallback-style-file</code> will be used, which
defaults to a bundled Chicago author-date style.
</p>

There are quite a few reference managers available, however, the list rapidly
shrinks if you restrict yourself to applications which are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>somewhat feature-rich</li>
<li>open source software</li>
<li>not owned by a parasitic company<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is a good option, and if you’re using it it’s quite easy to use it with
Org Cite. Out of the box, you can tell it to export your library, or parts of it,
to a <kbd>.bib</kbd> file and automatically keep it in sync. I’d recommend installing the
<a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/">Better BibTeX</a> extension though.
</p>

</figure>


<figure id="org5705a0d">


<figcaption><span>Figure 4: </span>Zotero collection export dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Zotero also works well with <span>CSL</span>. In addition to supporting <span>CSL</span>-<span>JSON</span> exports,
Zotero also features an easy way to install <span>CSL</span> styles within the preferences.
</p>


<figure id="org9dee5ef">


<figcaption><span>Figure 5: </span>Zotero <span>CSL</span> style management within preferences</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Since these files are put under <kbd>~/Zotero/styles</kbd>, you can use them with Org Cite
and Citeproc simply by setting <code>org-cite-csl-styles-dir</code> to the Zotero styles
directory.
</p>
<details id="working-with-zotero,code--1" open=""><summary><span>Emacs Lisp</span></summary>

</pre>
</div>
    </details>

<p>
To then use the citation style defined by <kbd>~/Zotero/styles/apa.csl</kbd> one can then
simply refer to <kbd>apa.csl</kbd> when using the <kbd>#+cite_export</kbd> keyword.

Org Cite has only just been merged in the past month, and is yet to be included
in an Org release, but we’re seeing a tremendous degree of community interest.
There are <i>already</i> promising developments with third-party packages, such as
<a href="https://github.com/bdarcus/bibtex-actions">bibtex-actions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref-cite">org-ref-cite</a>. I can’t wait to see how the ecosystem continues
to develop 😃.

      <div>
      <p>Today, Acting Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine sent the following letter to Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook’s misleading claims regarding the company’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">consent decree with the FTC</a>:</p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: </span></p>

<p><span>I write concerning Facebook’s recent insinuation that its actions against an academic research project conducted by NYU’s Ad Observatory were required by the company’s consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. As the company has since acknowledged, this is inaccurate. The FTC is committed to protecting the privacy of <em>people</em>, and efforts to shield targeted advertising practices from scrutiny run counter to that mission.</span></p>

<p><span>While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter. Only last week, Facebook’s General Counsel, Jennifer Newstead, committed the company to “timely, transparent communication to BCP staff about significant developments.” Yet the FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.</span></p>

<p><span>Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest. Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising. While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy – much less the FTC consent order – as a pretext to advance other aims. </span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>

<p><em><span>/s/ Samuel Levine </span></em></p>

<p><span>Acting Director</span></p>

<p>Back in the late 80s and through the 90s, Unix workstations were super powerful, super cool, and super expensive. If you were making 3D graphics or developing applications, you wanted a high-performance workstation and Sun made some of the best ones. But unless you worked for a huge company, university, or government, they were probably too expensive.</p>
<p>More than twenty years later, we have much more powerful and affordable computers, so let&#39;s emulate the old systems and see what it was like to run some of the coolest computers you could buy in the 90s.</p>

<p>Sun workstations started out running SunOS, based on BSD Unix (like NeXTSTEP), but in 1991 they replaced it with Solaris, based on Unix System V Release 4 (like AIX and HP-UX).</p>
<p>The first version of Solaris was actually Solaris 2, and to try and make sense they went back and named SunOS Solaris 1, but in the operating system it still refers to itself as SunOS. So Solaris 1 is SunOS 4, and Solaris 2 is SunOS 5, and Solaris 2.6 that we&#39;ll run is SunOS 5.6. Confused yet?</p>
<p>Ignore the naming conventions and just know that we&#39;ll run Solaris 2.6 from 1997. For comparison, at that time a PC would be running Windows 95 and Apple released Mac OS 8 the same year.</p>

						  <p>   It has never been very clear to me why a book requires a foreword. If the reason is that the body of the book is not self-explanatory, then the need for a foreword does not speak very well for the body of the book. And if the reason is that the book requires some sort of endorsement, then the foreword should, really, be written by a book salesman, i.e., an <em>obviously</em> interested party. (Nobody is ever fooled by ostensibly “disinterested parties” anyway.)  </p><p>   I am not really in a position to write a traditional foreword to Paolo Soleri’s book: first, because I am not sure I understand it—and so I cannot possibly interpret it with authority. (I am awed by it.) And, second, because I am not a disinterested party; I am his friend.  </p><p>   Having disqualified myself, let me proceed with the ritualistic foreword.  </p><p><em>Who is Soleri?</em> Answer: He is a wiry, medium-height man around fifty who was born in Torino, in Northern Italy, where he received his Doctorate in Architecture. After World War II, he came to the United States and became apprenticed to Frank Lloyd Wright. He was one of Wright’s two or three most brilliant students and was therefore kicked out by the master. Since that time, more or less, he has lived and worked in Scottsdale, Arizona, writing, drawing (on endless sheets of butcher paper), and building—both on his own acres in Scottsdale and elsewhere in the United States and Europe. He supports himself and his family by making ceramic and metal bells that swing in the breeze and make nice sounds.  </p><p><em>What is he trying to say?</em> Answer: I am not completely sure, because this is a very difficult book to read. Like many so-called visionary types, Soleri has invented his own language, and some of the words in that language won’t be found in any English dictionary. (Curiously enough, some of those words are a bit reminiscent of Italian Futurist talk of fifty years ago.) <mark altauthor="55">What I <em>think</em> he is trying to say is this: there is an inherent logic in the structure and nature of organisms that have grown on this planet. Any architecture, any urban design, and any social order that violates that structure and nature is destructive of itself and of us. Any architecture, urban design, or social order that is based upon organic principles is valid and will prove its own validity.</mark></p><p><em>What is he trying to draw?</em> Answer: A new world based upon those principles. And beautifully, too! What is more, it seems as if the first settlement of this new world may soon be rising on 4,000 acres some 70 miles from Phoenix, Arizona, on a lovely plateau 3,700 feet above sea level. Here, Soleri and his students—eventually as many as 2,000 people in all—will soon build <q>Arcosanti,</q> a community based upon the principles developed in this book. It will be, in Soleri’s words, <q>a self-testing school for urban studies,</q> a place where teaching and living will go on in an environment that is, in fact, the lesson itself. It is a daring project, and it will require financial support; but it is, to the best of my knowledge, the only <q>New Town</q> currently planned in the United States that started with a visionary idea of real force—rather than a mortgage.  </p><p><em>Is he practical or is he crazy?</em> Answer: In view of what has been happening on this planet in recent years, it is safe to say that those in charge are neither practical nor sane. This does not mean, of course, that any <q>visionary</q> profoundly critical of the present order of things is necessarily more practical or more sane. All it does mean is that anyone committed to the present way of building buildings, cities, or societies should disqualify himself as a critic of Soleri’s proposals. In one of his more lucid statements, Soleri says that <q>the care of the citizen is the sap of the city. But one can care only for that which one loves. A lovable city is the key to a living city. A lovely city is not an accident, as a lovely person is not an accident.</q> I rather doubt that the New York City Planning Commission, say, is likely to make LOVE its master plan; but if it were to do just that, who is to say that LOVE is not a more practical and a more sane policy than whatever that Commission is following at present?  </p><p><em>Why should anyone read Soleri’s book?</em> Answer: because that is the best way to gain access to some very remarkable ideas—ideas that will challenge just about everything all the rest of us keep doing, day after day. Soleri says that <q>the fundamental distinction between the city and the anthill</q> will be <q>not just brains by the score but also minds by the score.</q> This book is the work of an extraordinary mind. I keep thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Sant&#39;Elia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Antonio Sant’Elia</a>, who—to the best of my knowledge—never built anything at all, but whose drawings of <q>ideal cities</q> have profoundly shaped every modern city in the world.  </p><p><mark altauthor="55">In any event, I have not seen a book on architecture and urban design, recently, that has bothered me as much as this one. If that is an improper foreword, so be it.</mark></p><p>   The written content of this book is really an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny_(biology)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endogenous</a> affair for and with myself. In both knowledge and information my credentials are very limited, but it must be recognized that the conceptual criteria for the arcologies are the necessary stuff of their makeup. If I were to present the arcologies without their theoretical background, I would not be supplying any foundation for the conceptual process nor any comprehensive justification for the results. By limiting myself to the presentation of my own model of reality, I would be presenting a fragmented thesis and would not be able to follow up with a constructive proposal. There are perhaps many people better qualified than I am to elaborate a credible or usable model of reality. There is no one to my knowledge who has an awareness of the environmental consequences of the thesis here presented, much less made a serious effort at the deployment of any proposal.  </p><p>   The thesis demands a transfiguration of the earth without defiling or disfiguring its own cosmic aspects. The performance of the professionals, engineers, architects, and planners are doodles on the back of a cosmic phenomenon and will not do. Unlimited doodling produces squalor. In fact, the massive intrusion of irrelevance is enough sand in the cogs of civilization to spew out evil, in a very pragmatic sense. The exponential savagery of chaos is the outcome of false order, an order deprived of structure.  </p><p>   This work seeks a definition of the problem in its more general terms, an environment suitable for the species of man, a coherence that may be historically valid. To keep the reader engaged in the continuity of the process and conscious of its cosmic scale (and thus meaningful only within such dimensions), terms have been used that reiterate this concern. For the purpose of self-clarification, a <q>theory</q> has thus been developing parallel to the planning ideas. A theory is a framework of reference per se, fairly neutral. The use one makes of it measures its validity. Though constant adherence to a theory may sometimes dull the mind, it is a way of seeking and achieving coherence in one’s work. One tests both theory and the new idea by wedging one into the other. What follows is such a framework, whose great limitations do not completely cancel the advantage the author has derived from its personal construction.  </p><p>   To help the reader understand the material presented here, I have adopted two devices. The first is the use of diagrams to illustrate roughly the concepts. <em>The second is the use of italics for the fraction of the written parts that I feel carries or condenses the ideas.</em> It is possible for the reader to go through the italicized portions in an uninterrupted sequence and then come back to the complete text. Each chapter was written on a different occasion, a partial explanation for the lack of continuity.  </p><p>   A warning is necessary for the student. The graphics are not to be taken literally. The symbolism is evident and is characterized by the different hands that helped to produce it. The complexity of the system would in any case preclude the possibility of well-thought-out detail in the general context in which this book should remain.   </p><p>   “Man can be understood only by <em>ascending</em> from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. In other words he is <em>first of all</em> a cosmic problem.”   </p><hr/><p>   “…that power from which we derive so much pride, what is it in truth but the subjective consciousness of a progressive weld of humanity to the physical universe of which the great determinisms now act, no longer as formidable outsiders, but as through thought itself, colonizing us for a silent world of which we have become the agents?”   <sup><a href="https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/%E2%80%A6cette%20puissance%20dont%20nous%20tirons%20tant%20d’orgueil%2C%20qu’est-elle%20en%20v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9%20sinon%20la%20conscience%20subjective%20d’une%20soudure%20progressive%20de%20l’humanit%C3%A9%20%C3%A0%20l’univers%20physique%20dont%20les%20grands%20d%C3%A8terminismes%20agissent%20d%C3%A9sormais%2C%20non%20plus%20en%20%C3%A9trangers%20redoutables%2C%20mais%20par%20l’interm%C3%A9diaire%20de%20la%20pens%C3%A9e%20elle-m%C3%AAme%2C%20nous%20colonisant%20au%20profit%20d’un%20monde%20silencieux%20dont%20nous%20sommes%20devenus%20les%20agents%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(orig. text) <span></span></a></sup></p><p>   This work has a critical part and a constructive part. They are treated concurrently in the first section, where criticism is coupled with what in my view is a perspective suggesting a greater coherence. To help focus the problem, I have simplified it greatly. I do not feel this invalidates the results because the argument is kept in the context of a peach not being a potato and not of a peach being yellow or peachy; and the results are not a blueprint for a city-civilization but only a guideline toward a new option. After this first part follows the development of thirty schemes based on theoretical propositions and then a proposed micro-experiment in <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#arcosanti">Arcosanti</a> by the Cosanti Foundation.  </p><p>   In the critical inquiry it is assumed that the best hopes for contemporary man have been fulfilled and the urban medium has been cleared of slums and cleansed of ills and grievances. If there is no mention of segregated minorities, of slum clearance, of exploiter and exploited, of tax unfairness, of bossism, of children killed by delivery trucks, of skid-row peripatetics, of <q>pets not allowed,</q> of profit incentives, of self-help, it is because one assumes that in time the skill of man will take care of them all. <em>The foundation of equity is thus granted.</em> There is then happy man within the full-fledged <q>coordination</q> of city and suburban expanse. Megalopoly stretches over the continents from top to bottom, from left to right, emerging victorious and shiny above an unending and felicitous suburbia.  </p><p>   The critical end of this work is to confute the truth of such a condition; that is to say, such a hope is doubly false. It is false because it is not feasible; it is utopian in its inner contradictions and its detachment from the tenets of life itself. It is false in the sense of being deadly, a scourge many times worse than the squalor of present days.  </p><p><em>Life’s bulk is negated when megalopoly and suburbia are taken as the environmental bulk.</em> Their existence and hypothetical validity are at best only peripheral, the spurious fringe to a far more substantial structure. The inquiry is then into the construction of a congruous environment that such structure may define.  </p><p>   The questioning implicit in the first part of this book is aimed at the validity of the ideal we have put to ourselves. The contention is that this ideal is the result of a mortification of the worth of man and a partly involuntary abdication from the fullness of life, that it is fundamentally an evil, antilife proposition. The constructive end of this work is not to find either a timid alternative or a cure-all answer. What is attempted is the clarification of some of the very elementary processes by which the life of man and society seem to evolve, and then, using these concepts, the effort to define broadly some concrete organism coherent to the platform of the fundamentals reached, a platform regarded as historically valid. The position taken is evolutionist. That is to say, <em>I have little doubt that life in general and human life in particular can be symbolized by a vector and cannot be symbolized by a random pattern. Vectoriality is the character of living reality, and the care of man is basically a willful or unconscious action with or against it.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig9">Figures 9</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig10">10</a>) Antivector forces collect themselves in the unlimited reservoirs of entropy. The provector forces are striving at the reduction and eventual consumption of such reservoirs through a process called here the aesthetogenesis of the real, process and end, themselves the stuff of life. In this context utopia is the disavowal of any vectorial urge that might exist in the species of man and a settlement for something less than engrossing, for instance, a giving up in the <q>calm</q> sea of affluence.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 1: Ecumenopoly</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinos_Apostolou_Doxiadis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constantine Doxiadis</a> presents a frightening world map. The American continent is covered with a kind of fabric that reminds one of a dark and torn flannel worn by a strong torso. The holes are large but are just holes. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig1">Figure 1</a>) The dark fabric is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecumenopoly</a>, the universal city. The holes are the areas where the earth breathes and renews itself: a map of despair. Doxiadis forecasts a continent transformed into a human backyard. The teeming human ants are everywhere, and everywhere are human ants. Nor will the holes be spared. They will not be pockets of farmland or wilderness. They will be dotted by subcolonies and will be invaded weekly by waves of schizophrenic vacationers and seasonally flooded by a tide of discouraged suburbanites given to temporary nomadism.  </p><p><em>The quasi-unbroken membrane of biological and mental matter prognosticated by Doxiadis will be sheltered by the nonbiological paraphernalia of the man-made.</em> The Athens and the Florence of the Golden Ages will be stamped out in thousands of copies—ten thousand of them for a mass of one billion, one hundred thousand for a mass of ten billion, and so on. The thinking is that of a creature bound to a surface existence. <em>He has been given a surface enveloping a solid sphere, and he is doing his level best to carpet it with one or two or five layers of performance. It will not do.</em></p><p><em>One hundred to five hundred layers of performance will grossly produce a shrinkage of ecumenopoly to one one-hundredth of its suggested size.</em> Instead of a stagnant and far too extensive layer of pseudo-urban environment, there would then be fibers of dense vitality running over continents and seas, ribbing the surface of the planet. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig2">Figure 2</a>) They would actually be urban rivers whose core would serve for transportation and communication, whose top would be an endless airport, and the sides the actual urban substance. In the foundations and around them, the producing plants would be cybernetically organized. Taking off from the urban rivers, or coming to them, would be urban systems of smaller dimension ending or taking off from large modular cities, the subject of this book. <em>The material presented here is a schematic reference to modular urban systems that find full coherence as appendices and as origins of the urban rivers, carriers of the bulk of civilization.</em></p><p>   The demands of acceleration and deceleration, a slavery peculiar to matter in motion, a slavery not imposed on light, ultimately force on matter the inescapable need for miniaturization. <em>Miniaturization is the process that minimizes the prime handicap of the physical world: the time-space strait jacket.</em> This law or rule is so universal as to guide investigation possibly to the ultimate convergence among the apparent divergences that occur within the universal stuff of matter and energy and the puzzle of life versus death. <em><mark>Miniaturize or die has been the key rule for incipient life.</mark></em></p><p>   As the subject of this work is the city, one might anticipate here, and not just metaphorically, that miniaturize-or-die is and remains the condition sine qua non for the development of the social, collective animal contained in the towns and cities of the world. Secularization, the existential mark of our present, will be allowed or rejected by the advent or not of the physical miniaturization of our urban centers. <em>This occurrence is not just the key to success but the aim evolution has put to itself at this conjuncture of history.</em></p><p>   It could be argued that nothing new ever occurs in time, if not that a certain and constant polarity is slowly producing, in increasing numbers, clusters of performances in ever more complex systems. The living organism would be the collection from the four corners of the universe of a number of compatible happenings. Conception would be the trigger for such an implosive process.  </p><p>   In the case of the mind, where the unlimited possible implodes into the finite real, the farther away it finds food for its development and the more numerous the data caught in its net, the greater is its power, that is to say, the greater is its miniaturizing power, which depends in turn upon the degree of its own miniaturization. <em>It is as if step-by-step evolution would take account of itself and make a complete synopsis (miniaturization) of its achievements in order to have at its finger tips all the available power for the next leap</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig3">Figure 3</a>), demonstrating that the container of universality or wholeness must be the miniaturization of the best instruments available.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-002.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 3: Miniaturization   </figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-003.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 4: Universal Miniaturization   </figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 5: Miniaturization and Space   </figcaption></figure><p>   In a sense, there is miniaturization of matter and miniaturization of performance. One copes with the challenge of the future to the degree of success permissible by the degree of the other (and vice versa).  </p><p><em>Evolution suggests a pulsatory behavior that has devised a miniaturizing process for each step moving from matter to mind: miniaturization from unending and spare cosmic existence to geological matter, miniaturization from geological matter to organic stuff, miniaturization from organic to organism, miniaturization from organism to animality, miniaturization from animality to reflectivity (man). Now that man is working at the full characterization of the ultraorganism of the human group, another miniaturization is mandatory.</em></p><p>   All these successive miniaturizations are necessary because of the incremental complexity inherent in the progression. The greater the complexity, the greater the spatial and temporal obstacles to performance. Thus the necessity of fitting more into less, both spatially and temporally speaking, is proportionally greater. Furthermore, one can distinguish two kinds of miniaturization: <em>general miniaturization</em>—from the possible to the real; <em>specific miniaturization</em>—the evolutionary complexification of the real. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig4">Figure 4</a>)  </p><p><em>If the universe is a deterministic machine, general miniaturization now belongs specifically to man, as he is the one whose inquietude makes the choice among many possibilities a more than theoretical decision.</em></p><p>   That which miniaturizes into the real, but does not subsequently undertake <em>specific</em> self-miniaturization, becomes one of the dead limbs of history and is given back to naught. The society of man faces this danger, and because of the scale of his existence relative to the size of the earth, man is also directly endangering the existence of the earth itself. Inwardly, any organism is a superb device, a marvel in complexity, compactness, and congruence—a miniaturized universe. Outwardly, as a member of a group, it is little more than a torpid fraction of a cumbersome mechanism. <em>The superanimal constituting society has not undergone the miniaturizing metamorphosis, and it is by its very nature totally unprepared for the performance of its designated task.</em></p><p>   Society must become a true organism that will perform adequately. This will be made possible through the power of miniaturization. The physical miniaturization of its container, the city, is a necessary step to this end.  </p><p>   If we do not succeed in specifically miniaturizing our society, which has come from a possible existence in the species of man to a condition of elemental concreteness through the phase of general miniaturization, then this same society will not accede to the existential dimension of groping evolution.  </p><p>   Society has not yet been given the self-perpetuating stamina that characterizes organisms. It has to be constantly reasoned or forced into accepting its own existence and taking it more seriously than it does when facing its incipient death wish.  </p><p><em>Society is still an awkward animal suffering from a kind of <q>flat gigantism</q> that nails it to the surface of the earth.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig24">Figure 24</a>) It is sclerotic, asphyxiated. It is poisoned by the wastes it profusely produces and cannot expel. It is troubled by inner strife, not so much out of exuberance as out of cellular self-centeredness. It is to a very dangerous degree unfit to live. But society may well be the only road open to man. <em>Its miniaturization will make the difference between his confirmation or his death.</em></p><p>   This situation makes technology not simply useful but necessary. Man cannot possibly work at the miniaturization of the environment he produces before the right instrumentality has been invented. That <em>the reason for the existence of technology is the necessity for the miniaturization of the world of man</em> is not consciously known by the technocrat. It would help if he were conscious of this because a clear aim may avoid the occurrence of major mistakes, conspicuous among them the car and suburbia. The urban implosion will have two by-products. <em>One will be a proportional expansion of the earth. The other will be the feasibility of orbital colonies interacting with earthly ecologies.

It is present in nature. In a sense it is nature itself because her working is a constant coordination of disparate things into congruous patterns. With man this apparently automatic congruence ends. Most of man’s deeds are governed instead by antagonistic rules: love and hatred, enlightenment and obscurantism, peacefulness and belligerence.  </p><p><em>The plight of the underprivileged and the indigent demands the instauration of equity. The pursuit of equity is primary and essential to man.</em></p><p><em>The pursuit of congruence is substantially the transposition and the transfiguration of natural congruence into a congruence embracing the human condition. <mark>It is the humanization of the earth, and as such it demands a global coherence</mark>.</em></p><p>   To try for congruence bypassing equity is to give up the human condition. The sort of congruence so pursued may well end in total determinism, for which life can come as cheaply as the deterministic mechanism proposes. This would be a congruence of things soon to diffuse back into the sluggish congruence of fate. Congruity, be it between means and ends, between effort and result, between pain and the worth, between stresses, between dimensions, or in general between the part and the whole, is a relationship or a measure of balance. It is an ecological factor.  </p><p>   In the concept or precept of equity the congruence factor is purely internal, relative to the ethical frailty of man, a measure of equality in the face of misfortune or, more generally, a comparable ability to face hardship socially and economically. But because of its internality it may well happen that a good measure of equity will not imply a general congruence at all. A good social and economic precongruence does not correspond to a general global congruence (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig6">Figure 6</a>), that congruence which relates man not only to his social and economic milieu but also to the whole earthly (ecological) environment.  </p><p><em>Congruence is a function that tends to overflow all boundaries because it must call in cause whatever exists at a specific time, hence its ecological relevance.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig7">Figure 7</a>)  </p><p>   The contemporary human milieu lacks both equity and congruence. To take the United States as an example, despite extremely complex overlappings one can immediately see which devastation is caused by inequity and which is caused by incongruence. Racism, bigotry, greed, and fear are working against equity. Imbalance between efforts toward analysis and efforts toward synthesis, unconcern toward the ever more chaotic environmental puzzle, unwillingness to look for the roots and consequences of any endeavor, and, in general, an unlimited permissiveness construed as freedom are working against congruence.  </p><p><em>If indeed equity is a clear demand upon the personal and collective conscience, the essential force of congruence is broadly unfelt or ignored in both personal action and social and environmental ways.</em> There are now no signs that such congruity within society and between man and nature is consciously or unconsciously pursued. There is a kind of savage intercourse of forces toward a poorly understood neighborliness on a space ship that grows relatively smaller and concretely uglier.  </p><p>   It is thus that even equity per se would not assure validity nor would it be a grantor of perpetuity. It might instead resolve itself in equity in death, a man’s exodus into inequity.  </p><p><em>The hard fact is that equity without congruence is illusory. It is only an egalitarian common condition surrounded by an outer inertia and indifference that in its natural pervasiveness will dispose of the depositories of equity as a matter of natural fact.</em></p><p>   The starting point of the exposition is that a platform of equity is far from defining a condition of congruity and that the pursuit of such an elusive and constantly fluctuating condition is a task as staggering as it is essential. In bits and shreds the concepts pursued in this book are about congruence. The import and the indispensability of equity are taken as obvious and, for the purpose of the book, close at hand. In this sense the outlook is futuristic or, better, evolutionary.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 8: The Condition of Man   </figcaption></figure><p><em>Man is not created equal. Man is not created equal because he is not created but evolved.</em> With evolution comes inequality. It is quite possible that if there were pure order at the beginning, order by order, an identical ancestry would extend each man down to his origin with an identical pattern of facts and wills. The horror of that needs no further consideration. As things are, each ancestry is an original unreproducible reality that the present vitalizes through each individual endowed by it. This inequality is all that blesses man and that brings him sorrow. <em>One of the consequences of inequality is the endless variety of expression by which the stringently organized species of man goes on seeking its own plenitude.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig8">Figure 8</a>)  </p><p>   Is there a sense in defining a threshold beyond which variety spills into chaos? Or is chaos itself the full substance of variety? If variety and chaos coincide, we are the helpless spectators of an unbreakable cycle that sees an amorphous state of origin end in an amorphous state of finality where a potentiality for freedom has been bartered for a self-deceiving randomness. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig9">Figures 9</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig10">10</a>) <em>If, on the other hand, variety is exactly what chaos cannot be, then variety must be essentially a structural phenomenon. The inequality of man will then be not a sign of weakness toward chaos but the ribbing of the social body (homosphere) by its own propensity toward structuration. Society is structuralized by its own unevenness.</em> If this is so, such unevenness cannot be a blind scattering of resistances to a non-corresponding set of stresses. It has to be a circumstantial distribution of resiliences to the no-less-circumstantial set of environmental stresses.  </p><p>   Planning is the word used for the grouping of the configuration, the result of all the elements of investigation, analysis, data collecting, and data processing in reference to a particular set of stresses. There is the planning of nature and the planning of man. Geological nature <q>plans</q> by its unending patience, made of unlimited time carving unlimited spaces. Biological nature <q>plans</q> the construction of instinctive drives, the instinctive wisdom of the biological life developing over immense cycles of time. Man deprived himself of such a marvel the day he first saw himself and the first question came to his mind. <em>Man, short on time, small in space, plans by constant extrapolation, and he can do so in ever greater measure by pushing farther and farther the boundary of complexity</em>, complexity being his own special kind of unlimitedness—infinity. Planning is then essential to life, the alternative being chaos. It is somehow the stuff life is made of. Man lives by it, even if more than often he meets death because of it. Bad planning in such a case.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 9: Axiality</figcaption></figure><p>   In the context of environmental planning one could say that a valid renewal plan for a city can hardly be conceived if the mind does not have a stored-up vision of what the possible can offer under optimal conditions, or if the actual problem is not put in theoretical perspective wherein each of the many facets takes light from a unique focus, the focus of the historical moment to which the solution must remain true or else fail. The focus is really the head of a vector thrusting into the future (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig9">Figures 9</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig10">10</a>); thus the necessity of general, theoretical investigation and the importance of <q>utopias</q> where the ifs are accepted as the best potential, the hows must produce as much as they can, and the whys embody the real motivations.  </p><p>   The practical will always pluck out one by one the <q>impossibilities,</q> but even from such benighted archetypes will come enough design, structure, and inspiration to reconstruct a coherent organism.  </p><p>   On the other hand, the fragmented, industrious approach will not stand a coherent judgment. <em>If the knack for the <q>feasible</q> does not show the powdery nature of the practical, it is because it can only reach the periphery of the real, which is where, at best, the practical stands.</em> The real is the present. The practical is in most cases the past, a frozen imagery of the real not fully becoming. The American dream is the present as practicality rather than the present as the real.  </p><p>   Man is faced with the following syllogism: (1) The city is the cradle and the expression of civilization, and (2) materialistic society has all but destroyed the city. Thus, (1) materialism is foreclosing man’s destiny, and (2) the city is a nonmaterialistic phenomenon. If the city is a nonmaterialistic phenomenon, it follows that a speculative (business) attack on the urban problem is devoid of the fundamental power the solution demands, i.e., the care of a nonspeculative commitment. As speculation is, or was, instrumental for wealth, that which is not instrumental to it, but is rather its user, is that which is committed beyond speculative aims. Speculation can be instrumental to the city. It cannot be its aim.  </p><p>   As the city cannot be speculative, so it cannot be a handout by <q>authority.</q> The handout never cares. It is indifferent, just another aspect of the speculative exercise. Any care it may have had at its origin has been lost in bureaucratic meanders and their parasitic agents. <em>Care is a first-person undertaking. <mark>The care of the citizen is the sap of the city. But one can care only for that which one loves. Lovableness is the key to a living city. A lovely city is not an accident, as a lovely person is not an accident.</mark></em></p><p>   Free enterprise, the accidental compounding of speculative endeavors, if extended from the hows to the whys of man, becomes a killer. Free enterprise has had a technological success of a sort. Socially and environmentally it has been catastrophic. That is possibly the strongest reason for the impoverished environment of the United States. Its cities are a monument to chaos, social savagery, and amorphism.  </p><p>   Architecture redefined may open a door to the quest of the city for a new life. Architecture is the physical framework for the life of man, exterior to his own and all other biological frameworks. Architecture is the physical form of the ecology of the human, that configuration of matter which allows for the best energetic and willful flux. The care of architecture for a single building is peripheral to its basic weight as the environmental determinant. The city is a human problem that has to find its answer within ecological awareness. Short of that there is no answer; the problem remains unsolved. If to some this may seem a matter of course, to most the proposition carries no weight at all.  </p><p><em>The condition of man is strictly dependent on environment because man is eminently an environmental animal. If one adds that man is also eminently a social animal, then one sees that environment comes close to being preponderantly the city. The city is the true concern of architecture.</em></p><p>   The subject of city planning is then metropolitan man. How can physical conditions be such that he may be and express himself fully? What he does within the society he so constructs is our civilization.  </p><p><em>Metropolitan existence is a construct of private and public life so articulated as to provide each resident with a plentiful physical and economic access to both.</em></p><p>   Metropolitan life means access to the source of economic well-being, to all the institutions that make up the culture of a country, to the institutions of health, education, leisure, play interaction, and to the non-institutionalized aspects of private and collective life; short of this plenitude (access to it, that is to say), metropolitan life is not justifiable. In brief, the social animal is a lively and splendid animal, or it is a contemptible one, depending upon whether the city is to be sought for what is liveliest in man or whether it is a dump for all the parasitic aspects of his character.  </p><p>   In view of the exponential enlargement of what the <q>possible</q> is, and consequently the ever-growing appetite of men for all and everything, in view of the consequent impatience contained in ever-shrinking time packages, metropolitan life is assuming a sprinter pace that tends to be sustained for the whole marathon of an individual life.  </p><p>   The existing metropolitan pattern is not made for that. Even if constructed around a less insane transportation system, it would remain a pretty inefficient mechanism at best. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig23">Figure 23</a>)  </p><p><em>Practicality, the pride of this nation, has failed American civilization. The most practical man on earth, and the wealthiest on top of that, finds himself in a most extravagant and irrational position.</em> The American metropolitan man is just plain silly, and he is becoming conscious of it.  </p><p><em>The evolution of the one-layer city has been brought to an end by the rubber wheel. There are no real answers in the cities as we have known them, and, what is more, practical man must face reality.</em> Economic incentive is not a realistic guideline to the intricacies and the mystery of life. One Detroit makes this clear; fifty Detroits would make it fifty times clearer.  </p><p><em>Logistical failure is the one fundamental and purely mechanical reason for the decay of the city. Because of it, the price of metropolitan life is beyond what society can afford to pay. Mechanical failure makes it humanly unfeasible and economically impossible for the city dweller to desire and reach metropolitan institutions, whether they exist or not.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig19">Figure 19</a>) If such institutions are put out of man’s reach, they die, or they are not even conceived (suburbia). The outcome is a cultural stillness in the small community or large suburbia, combined with the worst aspects of megalopoly.  </p><p>   No organism can overcome prolonged starvation, even if it is starvation in the midst of plenty. Every one of its organs becomes segregated in an attempt to survive, and such mutilation brings about their abandonment one by one. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig19">Figure 19</a>) The present reduction of metropolitan life to a pure struggle for survival is the reason for the conception of a more apt system.  </p><p><em><mark>It is most reasonable to begin somewhere with an island of functional sanity and let its pattern spread according to its own merits, neither coerced nor coercing.</mark></em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 11: Structure and Performance   </figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>The Geological is the Massive.</b></li><li><b>The Vegetative is Extensive.</b></li><li><b>The Reflective is Intensive.</b></li></ul><p>   Nature goes from bulk (the geological) to complexity (man); nature goes from static (the geological) to dynamic (man); nature goes from torpid time beat (the geological) to duration (man) by the intermediary of photosynthesis and animality.  </p><p>   That which lives wants to become three-dimensional for the sake of complexity and intensity.

But man has an ancestry and an imminence, and <mark>man is truly the earth itself if he is anything</mark>. Total man is a preponderance of physical matter organized to perform physiological processes. These physiological processes are ends in themselves inasmuch as they are self-gratifying, and they are means to an end inasmuch as they participate in the construction of a species. The species is an end in itself inasmuch as it defines a specific triumph of sensitivity over indifference (the inorganic) and a means to an end inasmuch as it is the constant originator of the individual. The individual is an end in himself inasmuch as he is a member of the family structure. The family structure is an end in itself inasmuch as it is self-gratifying and a means to an end inasmuch as it is the smallest plurality of individuals of which society is composed.  </p><p><em>The real organizes itself like layers in an onion bulb. Each of these is an end in itself and a means toward greater complexity and scope. Whatever the layer, any motion toward a new synthesis (or layer) is predicated on the backing of the preceding.</em> IF the vegetal layer were not there to feed it, the world of the flesh would be inconceivable. In the same way the species of man is not possible without the preceding animal layer. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig12">Figure 12</a>) <em>Each new layer is contained and sustained by the preceding. It is not an accidental excrescence.</em></p><p>   As to the individual, the family, and the social layer, we see them welding and compenetrating each other. The growing complexity sends back to the biological and physical layers messages that become more and more exotic. Their answers become less and less satisfying. It is perhaps then that the individual jumps out of the family and social layer to seek his own answer (rugged individualism, free enterprise…). He soon finds out that his energies are not commensurate to the effort required. <em>He, as an individual, cannot create the world in his own image.</em> The fire of reality burns him to a crisp. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig14">Figure 14</a>)  </p><p>   And yet the world, as it is, is not fair or satisfactory. <em>Man must refund society as a cradle instead of a prison and communally move toward the establishment of a new physical layer, a neo-ecology that will be the new fertile ground where the seeds of the species may break into fruition.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig13">Figure 13</a>)  </p><p>   The body social is as if it were not, because of its fragmented physical container. It is a prisoner of its own inefficiency. An ideal container, working as a prototype, must then be introduced as the ideal pattern of the neo-ecology. This new physical layer is the new necessary container for man’s changing nature and the enormous bulk of man-made goods he wants to carry along.  </p><p><em>That is to say, the first step must remain as much as possible in the layer of the physical, that new geo-ecology that supports the biological, human, and social.</em> The scope of the model phase of arcology is then to produce a theoretical plan of such a neo-ecology.  </p><p>   Thus we remain in the layer of the neonatural, the physical. Because of this, information from other disciplines is limited in this model phase to background reference, a bit of a sounding board on one’s own experience as a social animal.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-012.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 15: Priority Chart (Side View)   </figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-013.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 16: Priority Chart (Top View)   </figcaption></figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><b>Reaches</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">     (Such Reaches are submitted to curtailments and to physical barriers.)    </td></tr></tbody></table><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><b>Discriminative (human)</b></td></tr><tr><td>Mandatory</td><td>food, shelter</td></tr><tr><td>indispensable</td><td>freedom, culture</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumental</td><td>productivity (useful)</td></tr><tr><td>Auspicial</td><td>occupation, leisure</td></tr><tr><td>Accidental</td><td>singular experiences</td></tr></tbody></table><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><b>Curtailments</b></td></tr><tr><td>Destructive</td><td>poverty, hunger, spite</td></tr><tr><td>Coercive</td><td>ignorance, segregation, bigotry</td></tr><tr><td>Sterile</td><td>automatism</td></tr><tr><td>Debasing</td><td>sloth</td></tr><tr><td>Nonsensical</td><td>the extravagant</td></tr></tbody></table><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Physical Barriers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Distance</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td></tr><tr><td>Weather</td></tr><tr><td>Tenuity</td></tr><tr><td>Disorder</td></tr><tr><td>Traffic Loads</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of design</td></tr><tr><td>Rigid schedule</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td></tr><tr><td>Storage of transportation means</td></tr></tbody></table><hr/><ol><li>    Each metropolitan man has to be at the center of the metropolitan world.   </li><li>    Such a world at the exclusive use of one man is not possible for two reasons: it is physically nonsensical and culturally contradictory.   </li><li>    Then the only open avenue is the organization of all urbanites into a very close fabric around a dense urban center.

It is said that in some of the largest animals of the past, in addition to the cranial brain, there were also local substations of decision-making matter. But in a very substantial way, to each body belongs one, and only one, central institution of give, take, and accounting. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig17">Figure 17</a>)  </p><p>   If we ever have a superorganism made up of men, men retaining their own uniqueness, then such an organism will be made up of thousands of millions or more of brains. Furthermore, each of those brains will contain a mind, that is to say, will overgovern that power of choice among the endless propositions of the possible, the one-at-a-time performances making the present.

They might want to glance at nightmarish suburbia with its six billion individuals; but it is their privilege not to reason about mankind and the staggering logistics it is faced with.  </p><p>   Indeed, the organism of a thousand minds exists today in thousands of examples: the towns and cities of the world, none too successful, most of them without a future. It is an organism so flaccid and so tenuous that even the elementary demands of sustaining its spare physical energies, of cleansing its receptacles and arteries (of giving to each cell its due), of procuring for itself a coherent reference to natural elements are hardly met. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig22">Figure 22</a>)  </p><p>   It is no surprise then that surrounded by foul play the individual mind reacts against any diminution of its right to self-determination. The pathetic thing is that this right has been wrapped for so long in a physical knot of chaos and irrelevancy that only a tenuous and ill flame still burns there.  </p><p><mark meditation="1">If there is any question about the inevitability of a society of man that will carry the individual to his personal fulfillment, there is no question of the inevitability of a superorganism of a thousand minds that will ecologically cradle such persons</mark>; it is the city of tomorrow. In such a superorganism the individual brain will have a collective counterpart: the non-biological memory archive and logical decision-maker, the computer. Then there will be a triad: the central physicochemical brain and peripherally the individual brains, each in turn hosting individual minds. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig18">Figure 18</a>)  </p><p><em>The morphology of the city will be determined by this <q>epidermic</q> distribution of wills, the mind of the city, composed of thousands of peripatetic particles all operating from individual brains.</em> In addition to this multiplicity of wills posturing themselves in collective veneers oriented toward the light (see the vegetal kingdom), there will be a centralized brain of non-biological character (unless technology allies itself to biology and medicine and brings computer <q>science</q> back to the ancestral father—the organic).  </p><p>   The phenomenon of the city, a congruent, humanized micro-universe sustained by the neonatural layer (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig13">Figure 13</a>) (the physical structure of the city), is <em>an ultracomplex organism whose centralized brain is the instrument that works for the satisfaction of the thousands of epidermal individual minds bound together by forces of sociality and culture.</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-015.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 19: Islands, Barriers, and Scattered Limbs</figcaption></figure><p><em>The concept is that of a structure called an arcology, or ecological architecture.</em> Such a structure would take the place of the natural landscape inasmuch as it would constitute the new topography to be dealt with.

It would be diverse and singular in all of its realizations. Arcology would be surrounded by uncluttered and open landscape.   </li></ol><p><em>The concept of a one-structure system is not incidental to the organization of the city but central to it. It is the wholeness of a biological organism</em> that is sought in the making of the city, as many and stringent are the analogies between the functioning of an organism and the vitality of a metropolitan structure. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig18">Figure 18</a>) Fundamental to both is the element of flow. Life is there where the flow of matter and energy is abundant and uninterrupted. With a great flow gradient the city acquires a cybernetic character. The interacting of its components erases the space and time gaps that outphase the action-reaction cycles and ultimately break down the vitality of the system. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig19">Figures 19</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig20">20</a>)  </p><p>   These are mechanical but fundamental premises for a functioning metropolitan life. In reality the idea is that of a very comprehensive <q>plumbing system</q> for the social animal, which the city is. The plumbing system consists of the previously mentioned man-made topography. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig48">Figure 48</a>) Social, ethical, political, and aesthetic implications are left out, as they are valid and final only if and when physical conditions are realistically organized.  </p><p>   To dispel the aura of cerebralism or utopianism from the concept presented, there is another way to see the central problem of the city: The degree of fullness in each individual life depends on the reaching power unequivocally available to each person. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig21">Figure 21</a>) In turn this reaching power is in direct proportion to the richness and variety of information coming to and going from the person. Information means not only sounds, sight, and so forth, but all the sensorial data, all the physical intermediaries that make any sensitivity possible; all kinds of inorganic, organic, organized, or man-made matter or material or instruments, from foodstuff to wireless, from toilets to television, from mothers’ reprimands to theater. This wholeness of information must include packaged and remote information such as television, radio, telephone, and the communications media, as well as environmental information. Environmental information calls in the technology of transportation, distribution, and transfer, and calls for the no less fundamental quality of the environment itself.  </p><p><em>This combination of remote and synthetic information and environmental information is indispensable to the nature of metropolitan life. In physical terms it means that the distances, the time, and the obstacles separating the person from all civilized institutions have to be scaled down to the supply of energy available to the person himself.</em></p><p>   If we inject into the picture the sheer bulk of products and devices wanted by and forced upon each man, we can see the dimension and the absolute priority of the logistic problem. The burden of matter, part of the environmental information weighing on every man, is impressive and also irrational. This matter has to be transformed, manipulated, moved, serviced, stored, exchanged, rejected, and substituted—the warehouses of arcology will have to be enormous. One thing nomadism has not been able to teach us is frugality. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig22">Figure 22</a>) What is the mechanism by which the rich and complex life of society can flow back into the structure of the city?  </p><p><em>In a society where production is a successful and physically gigantic fact, the coordination and congruence of information, communication, transportation, distribution, and transference are the mechanics by which that society operates. It is not accidental that these are also dynamic aspects of another phenomenon, the most dynamic of all: life.</em></p><p>   In every dynamic event of physical nature the elements of time and space, and thus acceleration, speed, and deceleration, are crucial. The speed of light, a space and time shrinker, well serves the communication of information of the packaged kind—television, radio, telephone—the synthetic information. Thus a good supply of synthetic information can reach even the scattered suburbanite (for him environmental information is and remains monotone, bone stripped).  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-016.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 21: The Reach</figcaption></figure><p>   The picture is totally altered when we come to transportation and distribution. Unless the feeding in and feeding out of these two is highly centered and axialized, the laws of matter and energy will see that sluggishness and possibly stillness prevail. <em>Swiftness and efficiency are inversely proportional to dispersion. Scattered life is by definition deprived or parasitic.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig24">Figures 24</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig25">25</a>) This can be verified by approaching the problem from the opposite end. The environment is vital and living information; it is the bulk of information available to man.  </p><p>   Blighted environment is blighted information. The cause of blighted environment is the breakdown of environmental information occurring when there is no follow-through from synthetic information to transportation, distribution, and reach. When this occurs, the energies of the individual are exhausted in the struggle to keep the avenues of environmental information open, to keep the flow of things going. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig19">Figure 19</a>) Man’s mechanically low-grade energies are absorbed, not euphemistically, by cement, asphalt, steel, pollution, and all sorts of mechanical, static, and dynamic barriers in an ever-enlarging frame of space and time. The flow becomes sluggish, it does not come to a standstill. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig23">Figure 23</a>) This blighted environment is a direct consequence of sluggish or dying flow.  </p><p><em>Impaired flow is ultimately the disproportion between the validity of the individual reach and the amount of energy that is expected to make the reach possible.</em></p><p>   One may thus say that because of the biophysical makeup of our world, rich flow—that is, rich potentiality—is the direct consequence of minimal separation between components. <em>Minimal separation between components cannot be achieved by using only two or three coordinates of space. Minimal separation between components is structured three-dimensionality, or it is not feasible.</em> The solid and not the surface is the environment where adequate flow is possible, thus where environmental information is rich and where life can flourish.  </p><p>   The surface of the earth, for all practical purposes, is by definition a two-dimensional configuration. <em>The natural landscape is thus not the apt frame for the complex life of society.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig24">Figure 24</a>) Man must make the metropolitan landscape in his own image: a physically compact, dense, three-dimensional, energetic bundle, not a tenuous film of organic matter. The man-made landscape has to be a multilevel landscape, a solid of three congruous dimensions. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig25">Figure 25</a>) The only realistic direction toward a physically free community of man is toward the construction of truly three-dimensional cities. <em>Physical freedom, that is to say, true reaching power, is wrapped around vertical vectors.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig20">Figure 20</a>)  </p><p>   There is a further and reinforcing reason for verticality. As individuals we act horizontally and need horizontal dimensions up to six to ten times the vertical dimensions. Thus, the compactness and richness of social collective life can be found only vertically. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig26">Figure 26</a>) <em>Around vertical vectors, megalopoly and suburbia can contract, moving from flat gigantism toward human and solid scale.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig23">Figure 23</a>)  </p><p>   If this concept is valid, as it seems to be in view of the nature of the physical and energetic world, then a dense urban structure is mandatory, regardless of the what, how, where, or when. A few generations of men reared and grown in an environment badly stripped of cultural and aesthetic scope may be sufficient for the brutalization of society. Signs that such brutalization is already at work are abundant and impressive. If man is quality against quantity, then the priority is clear. It is much too late for our present generation, bound to the spell of arrogance and license. It may even be quite late for the just born, but there is hope for the children of our children. The when is now, for lack of any reachable yesterday.  </p><p>   A passenger liner is the closest ancestor of arcology. The common characteristics are compactness and definite boundary; the functional fullness of an organism designed for the care of many, if not most, of man’s needs: a definite and unmistakable three-dimensionality.  </p><p>   Three main characteristics on the other hand are not common: the liner is structurally and functionally designed for motion within fluid; the liner is a shell for a temporary society of unrelated people; the liner is a sealed package connected to the outside only by way of synthetic information. Relieved of these three tyrannies, the liner, the concept of it, can open up and, retaining its organizational suppleness, become truly a <q>machine for living,</q> that is to say, a physical configuration that makes man physically free.  </p><p>   We have then architecture as the materialization of the human environment and ecology as the physical, biological, and psychological balance of conditions that account for the specific site and its participation in the whole.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-017.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 23: The Automobile Mystique and the Asphalt Nightmare   </figcaption></figure><p><em>Arcology becomes the cleavage of the human in the body of matter and life, probing for the ever-changing condition of the present in a manner congrous to the aestheto-compassionate nature of man</em> (see Aesthetogenesis).  </p><p>   Arcology is then that architecture so complex in scope, so sound in structure, so infrastructurally subtle and pliable, so comprehensive, and of such miniaturizing force as to alter substantially the local ecology in the human direction.  </p><p>   Arcology is then, <em>morphologically</em>, that of the man-made (I will call it neonature), which parallels in one an ecology and an organism—an ecology in scale, pervasiveness, and balance, an organism in complexity and dynamism; <em>skeletally</em>, a structure of such dimension, scale and organization as to be favorable to the interplay of the forces by which man and society grow; <em>functionally</em>, a compact, dense, and efficient organization caring for the intake, processing, storing, consuming, expelling, recycling of the elements needed by the complex life of man and society; <em>humanly</em>, an apt shelter for the multiple expressions and longing of man as an individual and man as a society; <em>formally</em>, a foundation for the aesthetogenesis of nature (into neonature).  </p><p>   If, for the sake of clarity, one separates the not-too-separable instrumentality from the scope (ends) (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig38">Figure 38</a>), one may say that the instrumental purpose of arcology is the definition of a well-rounded service system which, cutting into the waste of time and space, presents man with a few extra years of <q>positive</q> time, time to use to his personal, social advantage if he so pleases. That this may be invaluable lies in the assumption that life is precious enough and unique enough to demand rightly the best environmental conditions for its flowering and that coercion and frustration are inimical to life. Life is coerced by the environment man has produced and lives in. It is basically coerced by the very fact of the physical conditions he himself has compounded. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig19">Figure 19</a>)  </p><p>   The time-waste brought about by space-waste (functional and structural) by force of physical laws, including fatigue, results in cultural pauperism; thus, a waste of life at the level where such waste is unwarranted and unreasonable. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig22">Figure 22</a>)  </p><p>   The achievement of the instrumental purpose of arcology coincides by force of physical laws with nature’s conservation. The coincidence, which is also a reinforcing element in the qualitative scope of the life developing within the arcology itself, is a direct consequence of the identity of efficiency (in its full meaning, frugality) with axiality of life. Then instrumentality in its over-all power is vital to efficiency and thus, indirectly, is itself vital. (See Miniaturization.) <em>But the fruition of growth is in things that are not commensurable to that which would seem to be their cause.</em> Wile an apple is the fruition of a tree seeking continuity in the next apple tree, and in a sense all that is the new tree was already in the parent tree, the fruition of man is the creation of the <q>never been before and never to be again.</q></p><p>   At the same time the observation that life has never been so rich is invalid in the two directions of ratio and history. The ratio fulfillment–wealth seems to dwindle constantly. This indicates an ultimate exhaustion of human values submerged by and in a mechanism of ever-powerfulness lost to man’s purpose. Historically, the stage of affluence seems more a leveling of, rather than a stronger stimulus to, growth, as if affluence were at the same time cause and effect of a weakening in the thrust of evolution. Totalitarianism recognizes, or instinctively senses, this and capitalizes on it by putting ideals before affluence and in so doing, though possibly for the wrong reason, injects new purposefulness into individual motivations.  </p><p><em>The mechanisms channeling life positively may consist of the replacement of comfort and security by joy.</em> In joy, motivations are carried, uplifted, while in comfort and security they seem to be drugged, sinking into naught. Possibly when wealth would instrumentalize a joyful state instead of a security at any price, the negative side of conservatism. Joy comes from plenitude. Plenitude, though basically an inner condition, can be invited by an inspiring and stimulating environment and the feeling of working toward achievements that overreach one’s own limitation and embrace not just oneness but otherness as well: therefrom, the fruitions of creativity.  </p><p>   The pertinence of arcology to the condition of man, the condition of joy or indifference, is direct and immediate. <em><mark>Joy is then the burst of liveliness that comes with the fitness and coherence of a process that is developing under one’s eyes; it is the opposite of senselessness and squandering.</mark></em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-018.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 24: Life as Varnish</figcaption></figure><p>   The boundless squandering of the wealth of the earth is compounding all the other already harsh conditions and may produce a <q>civilization</q> without an earth to host it. One by one, in the short time of two to three generations, ecologies, fruit of eons of refinements, are destroyed. The degree of destruction seems to be in direct proportion to the amount of wealth and power; thus a dismal forecast of even greater destruction. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig1">Figure 1</a>)  </p><p>   The biological wisdom of an agricultural civilization has no parallel in technocracy. The frugality of the former has been followed by an irresponsible redundance. Nothing in scale, wealth, energy, and impact can equal the menace of technocratic urban and suburban sprawl. There, waste is a compound from the field of geography, agriculture, materials, energy, functionality, biology, and mind. Arcology is opposed to all of this. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig22">Figure 22</a>)  </p><p><b>Geographic Waste</b> Among the most hospitable and gentle lands, increasing acreage is taken by the chaotic fervor of real-estate and other enterprises, even when urban premises are absent and not forthcoming. The action, based on profit, automatically dissipates the premises, the serenity that was there. Even a real motivation would not prevent destruction unless predicated on long-sought care.  </p><p><b>Farmland Waste</b> Farming centers are becoming huge suburbias by means of speculation and illusion; again, total destruction of that which was the reason for the intervention of man, the fertility of the land.  </p><p><b>Material Waste</b> The atomistic nature of suburbia plays the sweetest song to the production madness of <q>free</q> enterprise. Nothing is indeed sweeter than raping nature and getting dollar bills in return, with its concomitant exhilarating power. Forests are transformed into cheap lumber, then cheaper shelters, from wilderness to slums in a matter of half a generation. Oil deposits are depleted in a few years by one tenth of the earth’s population for more than questionable ends. The same goes for everything else, from floors to roofs, from pavements to poles, from engines to tires, from printed paper to napkins.  </p><p><b>Functional Waste</b> The unnecessary reiteration of purely functional activities, mainly of a maintenance nature, robs the whole of its wholeness. One may think of an organism trying to exist with thousands of weak hearts frantically pumping fatigued blood through inadequate, sclerotic veins, thousands of livers, thyroids, lungs—there vegetativity at its passive worst would be miraculous.  </p><p><b>Biological Waste</b> It goes hand in hand with functional waste: a fractured landscape, poisoned and scorched vegetation, dust fumes, hot pavements, combustions, animal species displaced or destroyed, pollution reaching as far as rivers go—disruption and destruction of ecologies.  </p><p><b>Energetic Waste</b> The linkage to suburban cells, forever inadequate, is forever wasteful. The car, by no means the only case, is a good instance. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig23">Figure 23</a>) One sixth of the whole U.S. working force exists to keep wheels rolling, to say nothing of road building and maintenance. This alone is a terrible indictment of the sterility, grossness, and cruelty of our civilization. The whole thing assumes a gory and savage aspect when we add the 50,000 deaths per year, the countless crippled, the countless family wrecks, countless mental wrecks, and all the care, assistance, hospitalization, rehabilitation. The car is now a brutal and mesmerizing instrument, both physically and mentally.  </p><p><em>The saddest aspect of waste on the energetic side is that no matter how much we produce and install in horsepower, kilowatt hours, gas mains, fuel tanks, coaxial cables, the linkage is inevitably far too tenuous for a truly complex and vivifying society. True life cannot be spread that thin.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig21">Figures 21</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig47">47</a>)  </p><p><b>Mental Waste</b> Independence gone, variety gone, nature gone, <q>good air</q> gone, uniqueness gone—the frustration in discovering that one’s actions destroy the reasons for the action itself; instead, isolation, confusion, artificiality, ugliness, pettiness, and cultural death. If waste, meaning greed, callousness, and foolishness, is to be confined to a reasonable residual, action is in order, from the detail to the whole. The former deals mainly with an improved psychosomatic coherence between the individual and his acquired ability to telescope problems in their dimensions, spatial and historical (education). The latter is the relevance of this spatial historical dimension itself. <em>It is arcological in the sense that it provides answers only if faced comprehensively and nonsegregationally.</em> The configuration of society must change in its material as well as immaterial aspects. The two must fuse into one another. (This is achieved only through an aesthetogenesis.) To be sick of one’s culture is a well-kept tradition. But the explosive power of things at hand now is unprecedented, and the tide of an <q>instinctive,</q> robot-automatic neonature, overwhelming the biological instincts, is being sown among us by ourselves (against ourselves).  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 26: Apes and Men<br/></figcaption></figure><p>   All the preceding observations strongly suggest that physical clustering must prevail over scattering. One might say that scattering consumes its power in the act of scattering and, like shrapnel, brings death with each of its fragments.  </p><p>   Clustering <q>activates by compression, and the media undergoes a change of state.</q> It etherializes; that is what the good city has shown through history.  </p><p>   Nothing could be sillier than telling people they must cluster. Besides, people have definite ideas about overcrowding, functional asphyxia, freedom, taxation, urban crime—nor would they accept being herded forcibly into <q>wild</q> experiments. The smallest degree of leadership should see through the urgent plight of an exponentially decaying environment to the need for bold investigation-experimentation.  </p><p>   The arcologies presented here are in their abstractness an effort to suggest new approaches to urban dilemmas. In each arcology it is necessary to distinguish the concept, which one hopes to be valid, from the personal <q>sound</q> with which the concept is invested. The concept could be said to be the skeletal structure in its most abstract terms. Personal <q>style</q> would be the <q>formative beginning,</q> that is, the broad outline of a formal investiture of the organism; <em>hence the acceptance, or not, of the idea, separable from the acceptance, or not, of its aesthetic side.</em> (Beware of literal deductions.)  </p><p>   To position the meaning of arcology so that the hindrance of the present becomes proportionate to the relevance of the problem, some observations are necessary. Their generality should not distract from the truth that the energies of man cannot validly be directed against man or mankind. <em>Man’s struggle is within and somehow against a basically indifferent universe.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig55">Figure 55</a>) <em>In it the phenomenon of life is inexhaustible inasmuch as and as long as it is miraculous.</em> The bleeding of man at the hand of man in a fragmented earth, short of any hypothetically pedagogical value, should be matter for wonder and revulsion to all of us.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-020.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 27: The Borderline is a Complex Membrane<br/></figcaption></figure><p><b>The Physical Premises</b></p><ol><li>    The size of the earth is given and, grossly speaking, unchangeable (in the time cycle of civilizations at least).   </li><li>    The ratio acreage–man is shrinking rapidly on a planet rich in land of a forbidden nature, at least for a long time to come.   </li><li>    Gravity is an overriding force, perpetually governing the logistics of man-matter on our earth.   </li><li>    Climate, seasons, and day-night cycles are ecological realities and, as such, worth cherishing.   </li></ol><p><b>The Biological Premises</b></p><ol><li>    The energetic rules of life designate most or all of the fertile land for foodstuff production at the greatest rate of real efficiency.   </li><li>    The ecological balance of the whole planet is predicated on nonamorphisms, that is, on differentiations.

The earth surface is not a woven fabric but a pluriaxial, relevance-studded, hollowed-out bas-relief and it will become even more so (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig25">Figure 25</a>) lest an indifferent and undifferentiated mold takes possession of it.

(2) <em>The pull of what will be,</em> weightless in its nonexisting form, arbitrary at the low price of its fancying, dogmatic, drained as it is of the sap of reality, and artificial.  </p><p>   But man is prey to a much more real artificiality. He is always leaving nature, seeking the haven his mind prods him into seeing there, just around the last vestigials of the unconscious and vegetative. Leaving nature behind proves to be blood, tears, and even more, squalor, quite possibly all unnecessary.  </p><p>   The fullness of man’s life may lie in the balance between instinctive longing that reaches down through the flesh of ancestry and an intellectual unrest that seeks an etherialized universe. <em>Thus, man is positioned at the welding point where at the one <q>window</q> nature and wilderness are sight and touch, and at the other is the mechanism of the man-made, displaying bold forms, sympathetic shelter, and a wealth of care and power for the human condition.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig27">Figure 27</a>)  </p><p>   If society is able to put man on his borderline of nature and neonature (one displaying its unlimited and tale-telling structure—the other, a superstructure, the new world man is creating) and keep him at the same time as a vital citizen, it is there at the cleavage point that man, the lonely individual, may seek and find identification.  </p><p>   This identification translates physically into the container of his life and work, the home, in the whole and in the details such a life uses and expresses. Within it also is uninterrupted sowing for a richer present.  </p><p>   This means that, if so inclined, the individual should be his own master builder. The fruits of technology will afford him this (see <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#p1-ch17">Leisure</a>). Better education and a harmony-oriented society would be strong guidelines, channeling his expressions away from cleverness toward qualitative coherence. This coherence is fully colored by his own personal sensitivity but reflects whatever the body-social has given him and is now articulated by him and reinserted as the infrastructure of society (the city).  </p><p>   This is his contribution to the transfiguration of such structures into form (see Aesthetic Universe). <em>Neonature man is rooted in the earth landscape and seascape. The wealth and strength of his flight is founded on the consciousness and in the sensing of such rooting, on the nursing and care in him and around him of that which is <q>earth oriented.</q></em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-022.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 29: The Man-made: Neonature   </figcaption></figure><p><b>The Social (Collective) Premises</b></p><p>   The social superorganism, contriving and nursing mores, culture, and destinies, lives within the physical, social body. Its metamorphoses are not sequences of obsolescent skins and interior gadgetries but the slow or rapid emergence of the new from within the historically real. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig28">Figure 28</a>) The practical as a frozen likeness of the real is obsolescence. <em>A function of the real is to confine the practical to its function of lubricant in the cogs of the evolving present.</em> Then the structure of the body-social is slowly invested with the flesh of humanness, and its form disengages itself into freedom. The skeleton (structure) finds deliver from immobility through the supple exercise of the whole muscle-flex system, the superstructure. (The real thus becomes aesthetic and defies obsolescence.) (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig33">Figures 33</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig35">35</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig38">38</a>) So it is that the present may loose the brittleness of a flaking plane (obsolescence) separating an estranged past from a foreign future and may become instead the powerful thrust of an engrossing past pressing against that which is not yet.  </p><p>   This shows the need for a spatial tridimensionality of large proportions (arcology) capable of letting life run throughout in every direction in conspicuous flow and in <q>warm</q> surroundings, with the energies stored in it by not-obsolescent past; only this flow can carry and power the dynamics of ever-changing reality. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig50">Figure 50</a>)  </p><p><b>The Instrumental(The Technological World) Premises</b></p><p>   Defining neonature as all that was, is, and will be <q>man-made,</q> a nature filtered and manipulated by man’s mind and hands, this neonature can be grossly divided into two kinds: the instrumental and the aesthetic. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig38">Figure 38</a>) A third, as residual from the two not in size but in meaning, is extravaganza. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig29">Figure 29</a>) As in the blackest black an element of whiteness still persists and in the whitest white an element of blackness, so the pure technological does not exist any more than the pure aesthetic.  </p><p><em>The technological could be defined as the substructure of the aesthetic which is essentially <q>formal,</q></em> that is tosay, the superstructuration engendered by man’s compassion on the structure of existing things. Compassion in this context I regard as the fire that makes the purely just overreach itself into the genuinely human. Form would thus be the overreaching of structure. By this, structure finds its own full significance. <em><mark>As the universe is structure, the purpose of life is to take hold of it and help it to find its meaning, its form. Man is the eyes and the ears of a blind and dumb universe.</mark></em></p><p>   At the hinge point where structure interlocks or transfigures into form, and partakes of both in function and meaning, is the crafted—that neonature that more aptly shows by the biotechnical character of its form the ties man has with nature, while at the same time indicating clearly the resort of the species to artificial instruments and media for extending its control and manipulation of things instead of the constant development of new somatic <q>tools.</q> There is no symmetry between the two kinds, nor is craftsmanship constantly the separative or connective third kind.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 30: Science-Technology Cycle</figcaption></figure><p>   The situation can be illustrated by a man with no tools and determined to make an object for a gift.  </p><ol><li>    The man has an idea, and feelings brush and whisper around him, an everyday condition.   </li><li>    If a particular material or object was the starting point for the making of the gift, the man will try to act upon it according to what he <q>knows</q> to be its character. Thus, <em>working in the <q>nature of materials,</q> the man works at least potentially as a craftsman.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig31">Figure 31</a>) <em>If the idea is the dominant factor and its expression occupies his attention almost entirely, the man at least potentially acts as an artist.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig32">Figures 32</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig33">33</a>) The material will be more of a choice from necessity rather than preference. (It will be a reference.) Here then is the man and the intention as the avowed object (the fairly irrelevant category of such object: spoon, portrait, carriage, still life…).   </li><li>    The man needs an intermediate element that will permit his action (energy) to modify that material or object, if as a craftsman he had made the choice or if he tends to proceed as an artist. <em>Whatever the medium, man must make an instrument.</em> He proceeds by tooling himself, and with the use of his energies or borrowing them he will then act. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig30">Figure 30</a>)   </li></ol><p><em>In embryo, one has the craftsman and/or artist borrowing from the technologist the instruments he needs, the means of achieving a definite end;</em> man, the knife, and the carved splinter.  </p><p>   Is this sequence a yardstick valid beyond the elementary of the situation? If in the situation man is the demiurge and if he must keep this position no matter how complex the parameters may become, then this elementary pattern has universal validity. If this is so, our civilization is in mortal danger. What is happening is that the man got so wrapped up in the making of his tool (man the maker) as to lose view of the aim—the gift (man the creator). <em>The giving, not the making of a tool or the selling or the bartering, is the unmistakable sign of caring, and the weight of the giving is in the nonobsolescent value of the gift.</em></p><p>   The reason why the refrigerator or the TV set is not <q>the gift</q> is not because it is still an end to a means; the handmade spoon is so, too. It is because they are only a means to an end. Life rejects, as it must, as fundamentally irrelevant everything not directly and <q>physically</q> touched by the care of man (that is, the combination of intelligence, vision, compassion, and human awe peculiar to the species). That which is not so touched is and remains purely instrumental and indeed marginal to the fiber of evolving man, no matter how complicated and stringent its walled-in rationality. The substantial irrelevance of instrumentality is hard to grasp when man himself suffers from the same lack of <q>finality</q> or sacramentality. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig34">Figure 34</a>) The tool and the gift are heterogeneous in the sense that the soil and the fruits are in the natural world, or better, as the physical and biological rules are relevant to the fruition of life—relevant to life but meaningless as soon as life itself is canceled by the real. <em>Their relevance is one of functionality, not of meaningfulness.</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 33: Aesthetogenesis   </figcaption></figure><p>   Technology is instrumental neonature. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig38">Figure 38</a>) In it structure and function are overriding conditions, and their unadorned presence is the best sign of efficiency and coherence. But no amount of efficiency (good design) will keep the instrument away from the annihilation of obsolescence. Indeed, <em>obsolescence is the sure measuring scale for the validity of neonature.</em> All of neonature that is obsolescent is instrumental, and the rate of obsolescence measures the decay of its validity. (Exception is made for those tools that are direct extensions of man’s biological structure: the spoon is a good example, footwear, sight devices…) All of neonature that is not obsolescent is aesthetic. In a more encompassing proposition one may add: <em>Of all that which exists, nature and neonature, the aesthetic is that part and only that part of neonature which is not obsolescent</em> (hence the distinction between the beautiful/natural and the aesthetic neonatural).  </p><p><em>The validity of the instrumental is its functionality within historical terms (one minute–one century). It is because it functions. Aesthetic neonature creates its own validity by its mere existence. It <q>functions</q> because it is.</em> In the environmental field, neonature of the instrumental kind is <q>construction</q> (obsolescent). Neonature of the aesthetic kind is <q>architecture</q> (nonobsolescent). Physical permanence is not a pertinent aspect.  </p><p>   Architecture becomes ecological when a scale and complexity <q>explosion</q> occurs, and the sheer physical proportions of the organism, together with the potentiality of the life within, become an ecological determinant. Society must decide if the environment is purely instrumental (obsolescent) or if it has to contain in itself a different validity: aesthetic. <em>It must be remembered that the aesthetic is not the absence of the functional but the shrouding of it with the compassion of man (a person).</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-025.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 34: The Dead End   </figcaption></figure><p>   The aesthetic shroud is not an overcoat but flesh, that is, a vectoriality—permanently meaningful. This is why it has to be compassion, not whim, or greed, or fear, or bigotry, or hypocrisy, or arrogance…. A structuralized environment is a skeletal configuration in quest of a form (the aesthetic shroud), and unless this quest is given full opportunity, the society living in such a skeleton will be willfully forfeiting its human prerogatives and putting itself in the lap of a protohuman rationality. The end of the road is the total robotization of the species. What is more and, in short, worse, is that the skeletal condition being fundamentally repellent to man and life, man himself tries to camouflage the dried bones with fanciful dresses. This is fraud at its classical best. <em>Its whimsical moments cannot conceal the utter squalor of which it is cause and effect in one. Extravaganza is involution.</em> The anguish, deeply buried or clearly exposed in the <q>work of art</q> (all of them), is an almost biological consciousness of this <q>living death</q> pervasively scattered over the earth, overpowering by sheer mass and idolized by stultified life. This is the dark future with a technology for technology’s sake, and the many grim pictures given in literature will never convey the total nightmare of its advent.

At best, it is considered a pleasant superfluity, helpful for a status-seeking frame of mind, one of the amenities of life. Any effort to make of it something more is futile unless its place is found in the center of historical life.  </p><p>   As nothing survives time but that which is essential, the aesthetic is not a worthy burden to carry on unless it is the burden of life itself. <em>The core of life is aesthetic.</em></p><p>   The burden of life, its underbrush cared for, is the grasping of a universe statistically driven, finding its structure (science), retranslating it in rational terms (will-technology), and superstructuralizing it into a <q>form</q> in the image of man. <em>Man’s intensity shapes the natural world into the instrumental world to the point where the <q>critical temperature</q> reached, a metamorphosis of the instrumental, makes it into an aesthetocompassionate universe.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig35">Figure 35</a>)  </p><p><em>The aim of man is an aesthetocompassionate universe:</em> aesthetic, compassionate, the two aspects of the living at its <q>living best.</q> The living is only the living best. The rest is the aura of a past no longer pertinent. There is in the Western languages an undeniable indication of the central position of the aesthetic in the life of man: <em>the beautiful, il bello, le beau, el hermoso</em>…; it is in any and all fields the ultimate qualification. It is as if the redeeming power of the aesthetic could redirect even the most evil of evils toward a positive pattern.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-027.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 36: Residual Anguish   </figcaption></figure><p>   Access from the structural to the formal is possible only by leaping over all the structural, logical, and just diaphragms when they prove themselves inept because their presence does not disentangle the state of anguish that preys on the individual. <em>The residual anguish that does not abate in the comfort of the rational, the logical, the just is a residual that life carries in itself as the pressure of an immense megamachine,</em> all-enveloping and all-powerful, to which life is a dependent and fragile filiation. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig36">Figure 36</a>) The megamachine is the physical universe. The rules of the physical universe are not benign to man because the stuff he is made of is soft, delicate, impermanent and because performance in life is dependent upon very few gauges of all the unlimited substance of the physical.  </p><p>   The combination of powerful mental processes and the utter precariousness of living tissue cannot but produce this residual anxiety, impervious to all attacks if one excludes faith in a providence instituted by a divine guidance.  </p><p>   Residual anguish demands a resolution that can be found in the hands of a God or that can be created by the mind and the hands of man. In the absence of an extrahuman faith, the alternative is the metamorphosis of the real by the aesthetic act. By way of it inward-bent anguish mutates into outward-moving compassion, carried and fused within the formal substance of the creative.  </p><p><em>The aesthetocompassionate act bends the structural reality of space-time into a rarefied condition governing itself through ultrastructural, formative forces.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig33">Figure 33</a>)  </p><p>   The aesthetic, not being descriptive, cannot be explained (described) from without. It can only <q>be</q> from within itself. In this exclusiveness is the wholeness of the aesthetic performance.  </p><p>   In a sense, that which can be described (translated into a new media) has not reached the outer limit of its own realm and is constantly awash in the surf of obsolescence, as if the lack of a containing and fitting membrane had made the content easy prey to the enormity of the total envelope, the megamachine.  </p><p><em>The aesthetic conclusion is a secure harbor where the mental stuff can shelter particles of itself in wait for the last sweep of fire that will weld them together into the ultimate form of reality, a reality of which evolutionary man is a partial and historicized image.</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-028.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 37: The Individual Emergence   </figcaption></figure><p>   This may all be well—but what about starvation, pauperism, slavery, and ignorance, so widespread, so cruelly overcasting human life? Any effort in any field is doomed to frustration if it is not guided by a thrust into the pattern of the future that not only makes sense but is also dynamic. <em>Action is sterile without a vision that makes it real and engrossing. The fuel of action, short of being truly compassionate, is counter to life, unhuman.</em> The disheartening slowness of any progress toward freedom from need is mainly fruit of a greed out of proportion to any justifiable fear of insecurity.  </p><p>   To make matters worse, there is the misplaced exhilaration of man when presented with an extraordinary amount of power that opens the door onto countless rooms cluttered with hypnotic, shiny, utterly fractured things.  </p><p>   The rationalizing ability of man would be amply sufficient, even redundant, for a rapid elimination of his ills if only he could distinguish the contingent and the precarious from the permanent and humanizing. By so doing, man would adhere to the essentials (not the skeletal only, nor even the extravagant). Short of total savagery, all men will <q>one day</q> be biologically relieved of need, that is, not just free from physical need but also free from labor.

A very feasible and significant step in this direction would be the participation of ten to twenty major business corporations in the development of a superstructure containing the home office of each, plus residential facilities for personnel, laboratories, and the necessary cultural ingredients. This would be a pilot <q>city</q> of arcological momentum.  </p><p>   Once the experimental phase had furnished guidelines, arcologies could be conceived for specific programs. A refusal to face this necessity and pay the price for it will result in an accelerated decline of the urban tangle and a rapid decay of civilization. This direct interdependence is what we have tried to illustrate in the preceding pages.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-031.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 40: The Tornado   </figcaption></figure><p>   Examples for the <q>arcological approach</q>:  </p><ol><li><p>     The failure of an existing urban center to rally and recapture its needed vitality induces urban authorities to plan a step-by-step withdrawal of the social body from the condemned town. This could mean a dislocation of the whole population away from the old site. If the site has proved obsolete or nefarious per se, a more suitable site may be chosen. If not, the arcology can spring out from the discarded shell (the town).    </p><p>     In the long run this latter situation may prove to be the wiser choice. It would rehabilitate a depleted site while carrying a continuity into the process. It would clear the rubble, restore a few structures worth preserving, and would not take a new parcel of land away from the environment.

This amorphous condition spreads with centrifugal acceleration (the community is <q>growing</q>). A need and a demand for a centripetal counterflow is solicited by the stiffening caused by such scattering. A critical level is reached when the necessity and the demand for convergence becomes dominant. The idea of an organism is injected into the <q>critical status</q> condition.    </p><p>     An (abstract) archtype, the arcology, helps to establish a structure. At the critical moment, when the change of state will occur from scattered atomist to centered organism, the abstract structure is put aside, the pertinent morphology is conceived and gradually realized. In accelerated motion one would see something like a benign tornado uprooting one by one the loose cells of the town, clustering while transforming them on a functional axiality, leaving at the feet of the new <q>town</q> a large space for the rehabilitation of nature as it may fit the needs of the citizens.

A new center (arcology) is conceived to care for developing activities and increasing population.    </p></li><li><p>     Mining, quarrying, or other similar undertakings have left a large scar on the body of the land. Its idleness and ugliness, the danger it represents as an ecologically regressive factor—soil erosion, floods, depletion of wild life—are demanding a healing action.    </p><p>     A vacation center, a health center, or research, or culture may be the nucleus of the new city, establishing an ecology of its own, <q>a monument</q> to man’s care. In this case the exposure of the geological backbone would be advantageously used for the rooting of the arcology.

In each of the listed cases a great mobilization of resources has been needed: science, engineering, power, power machinery, and labor. Furthermore, all kinds of utilities are brought into use: roads, railroads, landing fields, water, power, telephone. The sites, more often than not, are beautifully endowed. Finally, there are the colossal structures themselves, bold but lifeless.    </p><p>     The organization of such megastructures into plurifunctional organisms seems not only justifiable but so rewarding as to make man regret their absence. <em>This injection of man’s society into the body of the megastructure is essentially an introduction of <q>porosity</q>—from undifferentiated solidity to cellular resilience,</em> structurally from passive weight resistance to dynamic contraposition of forces. Even here at the elemental protoliving level, there is a suggestion of becoming.    </p><p>     These constructs, so diverse at their roots, would foment—almost force by the nature of their scope—infrastructures, social as well as physical, of unexpected and fertile novelty. The minds as well as the meter would have to rise to the challenge or risk the grotesque.

Such highly productive organisms would at the same time alleviate the population pressure of those sea-conscious nations (Japan) that have been exploring and harvesting the seas for centuries. Such would be the new forms of life and society on and within the seas, where the surface marine life would have a mirror-imagelike counterpoint in the submarine, manned by the new oceanaut breed.

Standardization is the virus.  </p><p><em>The countless blessings of standardization must not blind man to the incontrovertible fact that total standardization is total depersonalization.</em> This is after all the means by which it <em>can</em> work: to take out of a product everything that, colored by <q>personality,</q> may infringe on the capability of being <q>uniformly</q> produced.  </p><p>   Is there an ontological dilemma? Wealth by standardization—with it and by it a society of automata, or a society of <q>hand-makers</q> rich in individualism but forever pauper? Certainly not. Standardization has built into it the means to an answer. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig43">Figure 43</a>)  </p><p>   Automation is the answer: man’s release from the toil of labor, that activity to which man has always been bound so as to produce on his own and/or to acquire the buying power he needs to survive. <em>With production (and then maintenance) given to automation via cybernation, the acquisition of buying power will take on a totally different meaning.</em> The choices for man, paid for living but no longer for laboring, will be two: idleness or creativity (play in between by choice), the two faces of leisure. <em>The responsibility for personalizing the automated society will fall on the creative use of leisure.</em> Freeman disinterestedly working, and the gift again appears. It does so justly and right in the center of life, there where man is seen as a unique element co-operatively involved in the formation of his culture: the aesthetic universe. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig28">Figure 28</a>) This individual creativity could articulate on nonanonymous terms the infrastructure of the arcologies by physically inserting the individual’s own construction (home, office, workshop, store) within the broadly constructed megastructure: organism and individuality as against chaos and coercion.  </p><p>   It should be remembered that such a base of organization, the arcology, is per se a superrational and superstructural phenomenon. Thus there is an enveloping aesthetic neonature and within it the detailing of <q>molecular</q> aesthetic personalities. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig18">Figure 18</a>)  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-035.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 44: Ownership</figcaption></figure><p>   The organization of man’s life, subtly directed by the machine, which is organization, is going to reach forms unheard of. Hour by hour, minute by minute, <em>man will be on a track on which his freedom will be <q>traveling.</q> Mentally as well as physically, he will abide by schedules computed for efficiency.</em> If this pattern is only temporary and made obsolete by greater sophistication in cybernetics (and discarding the intervention of evil), it will still be with us for more than one generation. What is more, it will be, and is already, conditioning man to a generalized form of nonresponsibility and nonwill which is very hard to overcome. (The illusion of the profit incentive through free enterprise is on a dead limb.)  </p><p><em>The <q>organized freedom</q> promised by progress will conquer the contradiction inherent in itself only if instrumentally contained. In other words if an ever greater interiorization of reality takes place, a jealously private and cherished individuality will correspond to a collectively resolved and working functionality.</em> Thus, the pattern of today’s society will reverse. In this patter there is an almost pathological concern for the possession of matter (organized or not), and as a psychobiological consequence the mind is the slave of the <q>system</q> that makes this possible. For the true, free individual, the common use of matter as instrumentality will release his energies for his own free flights. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig44">Figures 44</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig45">45</a>)  </p><p>   Real ownership is knowledge, while we must possess only that which is foreign to us. <em>That which I understand is mine, and the understanding is the true possession, not the physical holding of it.</em> Interiorization is the ability and joy of grasping what is out there and assimilating it. It is the first phase of the two-phase cycle of the aesthetic process: interiorization and expression. Expression is the materialization of that which, originally physical, has been interiorized. This transfigured matter is aesthetic neomatter, and it is not solely our anchor to freedom, it is freedom itself. <em>Freedom is creativity, or it is only the <q>choice</q> of that which is unavoidable.</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-036.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 46: Time and Duration   </figcaption></figure><p>   Customarily man constructs his immediate environment by inserting individual, man-made structures into the larger structure of nature. He accepts or takes for granted that the natural setting is the only possible base of departure, and he sets out as an individual to get the best of it. The approach does not change when the given base is no longer the original ecology but an aggregation of the man-made, composed of all the other individual, granular undertakings that preceded its arrival (homes, shops, gas stations). Thus, he will accept his lot among <q>the lots,</q> that roof among those other roofs—<em>he will submit in other words to a situation that carries coercion without a reason behind it, if one excludes the nature of randomness.</em> The problems arising from the unnatural conditions that this pattern develops do not find solution in any of the natural devices that one may call, generally and comprehensively, ecological.  </p><p>   The reasons for the deficiency or inefficiency of the natural laws are probably inherent in man’s basic nature, man the maker, that is, and in the strictly related phenomenon of duration—and the forcing of biology into the kind of rationality that is no longer bound by laws of probability but by intelligence-will. Man literally rushes evolution at a pace the intellect seems to press for, even when and if too much is scattered and lost by the wayside. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig46">Figure 46</a>)  </p><p>   The element of individualism compounds the difficulty because of the limited historical significance inherent in the struggle for self-assertion and the fundamental inefficiency of the total aggregation, instrumentally stifled by the unaccountable bypasses of each human monad.  </p><p>   Hence man, instead of stepping from <q>natural</q> ecology to man-made ecology and from there to culture, sidesteps into that condition of amorphism which is chaos. The gap, structure of nature—structure of man, needs a bridge. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig13">Figure 13</a>) This is the <q>in-between</q> whose character may be the coordinating form through which nature itself may be filtered, transfigured, and humanized, that is to say, torn away from the laws of great numbers by which the proto-living abides and aestheticized as the human seeks.  </p><p><em>This in-between bridge is the city. It is a neonature within which each individual granule should find its location tridimensionally significant and durationally congruous with history.</em></p><p>   This was the <q>polis,</q> organized on a few fundamentals, each a handful of ideas-processes: the earth ruler, the divine ruler, productive skill, administrative skill, bartering skill, play—the plague. It was a relatively simple <q>organism,</q> instrumentally efficient in the satisfaction of relatively simple needs. As the organizing process lost track of the parameters, ever increasing and interwoven, organization broke down until the idea itself of organization was questioned (laissez-faire).  </p><p>   Unfortunately, or luckily, biology and physics are not bypassed by disregard. <em>Very basically, one may say that matter must move swiftly if ideas are to grow</em> (which they must). This is the miracle of biology, a miracle reaching the sublime in reflection: man.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-037.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 47: Tenuity and Roundness   </figcaption></figure><p>   The mental finds in biological harmony the means to creativity.

It is self-evident that a one-layer mechanism is inapt for the care of ever-increasing complexity. And the failure of granular neonature on its purely instrumental basis is also self-evident.  </p><p><em>Megalopolis as well as suburbia is functionally irrational because it is essentially bidimensional, even when made of granular stratas.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig47">Figure 47</a>)  </p><p>   This condition of outer bidimensionality reaches down to the individual, isolating him, causing upheaval and disruption.  </p><p>   We interpose between the scattered plenitude of nature (remember its unhuman module of space-time) and the dense introspective plenitude of man the platitude of our handiwork, the artificial. <em>What we need is that in-between structural system by which nature itself is filtered and welded in forms more apt to carry the extreme valence of contemporary man, an ecology made of nature and man, framed in an architectural system.</em></p><p>   Then man will step from natural ecology into a man-made ecology to find a number of assets:  </p><ol><li>    Mechanically, the structure of the whole serves him efficiently for all his material necessities.   </li><li>    Humanely, to the mechanical freedom acquired and because of it, he can add an access to self-expression, integrally compounded and not just encroached on the whole.   </li><li>    If he so chooses, he can feel and be part of a graspable and awesomely alive and telling system.   </li><li>    Culture in bountiful amounts is where he is: it is infinitely varied as an infinitely complex life develops in the four dimensions of the organism (duration being the fourth dimension).   </li><li>    Nature, the ancestry of man in its unending novelty and secrecy, its generosity and harshness, is at his window and at his door.

Laboratories produced organic matter at first, while physics and astronomy became a mathematical cosmos, constructing lethal formulas on the side. Then came genetic repair, then genetic constructions, then assemblage of genetics and electrochemical devices, and finally the man-made man….  </p><p>   If to collect litter may be the aim of the street sweeper, it is not the aim of the sweeping institutions. The aim of the sweeping institutions is cleanliness. In a similar way, though the scientist may claim total indifference to what he calls the application of science, the institution of science is ultimately not the understanding of things but the power the man acquires through such understanding and by this power the ability to guide his destiny.  </p><p><em>If man were a purely self-constructing knowledge, then one could maintain that the aim of science is knowledge. But man, being essentially a clustered energy (power), his and science’s aim can then only be the organization of such power in ever more fruitful forms.</em> (One can then see that at this <q>superenergetic</q> position man becomes a creator in his transfiguration of matter through the aesthetocompassionate process.)  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-039.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 49: The Pulse of Life   </figcaption></figure><p>   It would be utterly senseless, unscientific, to achieve knowledge and stop short of making it an instrument for the fruition of life. <em>As the pulse of life tends to establish ever higher platforms, science and technology are responsible for their structural solidity.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig49">Figure 49</a>)  </p><p>   Technological betrayal lies in deficiency most of the time, not in evil. Thus, the joy and fulfillment of knowledge is in its power to coerce universal indifference into a willed structure. But the willed structure that science can construct is only a copy of nature’s work: we call it invention. It is a copy within a compressed duration, bridging above the laws of probability. <em>Anything that science does above and beyond a copy, it does as aesthetic, not as science. This is because in such instances science no longer proceeds rationally beyond the individual but, at the very opposite, as a most personalized and intimate experience.

Thus the meaning of science is in its finding of efficiency through guided endeavors, guidance not left to the drift of cosmic <q>laws</q> but held in by the purposeful energies of reflection. To do is to know (<q>actively</q>), and the asset of knowledge is its positioning of the energetic world in such a pattern and structure as to make the doing not just easier but also unavoidable. This unavoidable doing that makes man look like a madness-driven creature, carves the tunnel of life within nature and frames the walls and ceiling (encumbered by their entropic drift) with the structures of neonature. Those structures can be purely instrumental (structural), in which case obsolescence will obliterate them, or can overreach into form, making explicit and lasting the reverence and awe of man toward both the infinity that surrounds him and the complexity (infinity of another kind) that is within himself and is himself. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig50">Figure 50</a>)  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-041.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 51: Man the Discoverer</figcaption></figure><p>   The aim of pure science is knowledge, and this it does through the progressive uncovering of the secrets nature stores and is. <em>The unspoken aim of science is the manipulation of those (once) secrets to remake things in the image of nature, of which those secrets are in the first place. Thus science can be said to be the recycling of nature through the human filter.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig51">Figure 51</a>) <em>If and when from the recycling a <q>never-before</q> thing results, the aesthetic act comes into being.</em> (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig52">Figure 52</a>)  </p><p>   In this way there is in science a bartering of existing things between the stony infinity of cosmos that alters the character of them both but does not really spill into the new. This would be creation, and creation is of another nature. It has to deal with superrational processes, unscientific by definition. Science rejects the nonrational as unreal. In so doing she puts herself in a position of non-competence in all those fields or things that though existing, inasmuch as they modify the real, do not avail themselves of any computation or any methodological inquiry. If then science shows that part of the real may not be rational, it will immediately add that of <em>the real</em> only that which can be methodologically understood is meaningful: that which I do not know and I will not be able to know is irrelevant—<em>implying again that since knowledge is only possible of that which is measurable, measurability is the only reality. Is creation measurable? Is it not measurable out of ignorance or is it not measurable out of incommensurability?</em></p><p>   It seems to me that in the answer to this question rests the qualification of all of man’s doing and the clarification of where the substance of life and humaneness lie. If the answer is that creation is not measurable only because of a temporary lack of knowledge, then <mark>the real (universe in its totality) is a <q>scientific</q> system gazing upon itself by way of man’s intellect (reflection)</mark>.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-042.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 53: Structure and Form   </figcaption></figure><p>   If the answer is that creation is incommensurable in the sense of being beyond measurability, then the real is a superscientific system (generating from a scientific foundation). <em>I have been calling this ultrascientific <q>system</q> the aesthetogenesis of the universe.</em> Aesthetogenesis, and not ethos-genesis, or virtue-genesis, or sociogenesis, or love-genesis—because those are somehow the facets of the total, co-ordinative body of that harmony which aesthetogenesis means by grouping them under the name of compassion. I see them as the substance structuralizing life, to the point where form is <q>conceived</q>: the hyperstructuration of the real. Creation appears at the inception of form, where what one may call a content is sufficiently organized as to structure itself and leaps or explodes into a new status, its own form, the (aesthetic) shroud to its own self (compassion). If the second answer is closer to what existence is, then the position of science is to be circumscribed within the boundary of instrumentality. As such it cannot dictate to man his future but is to be weighed by man himself step by step so as to keep its uncovering and use within the boundaries of humaneness, the boundaries that science cannot define as they are beyond its reach. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig53">Figure 53</a>)  </p><p><em>In a very direct way this signifies that a technological environment is a nonhuman environment, and the question is not of adapting man to it but of investing a lean system of not purely instrumental flesh on its skeletal structure, the shroud here indicated.</em></p><p>   One may now say that everyone knows that we must beautify our lives if we want to find joy and happiness. This is a truism so mechanically repeated that no one bothers even to believe in it or act by it. And this is so because there is no real compelling force behind it all in the way the whole thing is explained. The usual explanation is that for lack of more serious or weighty things to do one can always find reward in putting up veneers of prettiness on the substance of matter. But that naturally is matter that does not count.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-043.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 54: Amorphism and Structuration   </figcaption></figure><p>   You do not eat beauty, nor can you scrub yourself with it. The answer is naturally immediate and unmerciful: <em>man does not create in order to eat. He eats in order to be human.</em> To be human is to be a creator. If this were not so, the greatest service science could do for man would be to return him to the jelly life of the primeval seas. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig54">Figure 54</a>)  </p><p>   This taking back of man is practically perpetrated by every single coercion on humaneness, bet it by means of individual renunciations, giving up, as one says, or by means of many institutionalized allegiances. In short, it is the choice between evolution and involution, between amorphism and (structured) superstructuration.  </p><p>   Free enterprise assumes that things controlled by man can operate as any other phenomenon does, that is, according to the laws of great numbers. This assumes that (1) the <q>materials</q> with which it begins are structural, and (2) time is for man’s purposes unlimited.  </p><p>   Before disputing these concepts, one has to confute the position that nature works by average laws. Up to the inception of life, in pasts beyond imagination, this was probably close to being so. Beyond that threshold and facing the future, choice—that is, the rejection of a statistical unfolding of things—ingrains itself ever more deeply into the texture of nature. <em>With the birth of choice, the structure of the fatal, rigidly framed by the limitlessness of space, in a time beat scarcely audible (or conceivable) is chiseled away as marble is by a sculptor seeking a <q>historically valid form.</q></em> Evolution carves itself out of the immense body of matter-energy, and the barriers of the impossible as well as the decay-entropy are constantly, unremittingly pushed aside, the probably giving way to the ever more improbable.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Figure 55: Fate and Destiny   </figcaption></figure><p>   Yet two formidable allies of entropy, sloth and reaction, are nested in the arrowhead of life itself. Through countless disguises, within the folds of free enterprise, the statistical finds enough ground to work itself into <q>motivation.</q><em>One then acts not out of intensity or reverence or, one might say, love and compassion but because a tabulated experience, abstraction of the past, <q>strongly</q> suggests the way to go.</em> That amounts to a past, sterilized by the extraction of averages, unexplained and unexplainable in its progression but tabulated in its <q>results,</q> which is taken as the unfailing guideline for a future of no future because it essentially feeds on hopelessness. (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#fig55">Figure 55</a>)  </p><p>   Let us return to the two assumptions:  </p><ol><li>    The <q>materials</q> with which free enterprise begins are structural. <em>The materials, aggregate of accident (ego) and the shaped instrumentality, are not structural.</em> Accidents and ego have altered the <q>probable</q> structure of the nonliving without co-ordinating it and themselves within any structure, much less any superstructure.   </li><li>    Time is for man’s purpose unlimited. Such time is not unlimited. Time moves for man by the beats of generations or, more humanly, by the flickering of an eye, the hint of a smile. <em>The fault with laissez-faire and free enterprise is their basically irreverent outlook on life.</em> Theirs is the loveless position of a conscience that beats not in resonance with the granulation of rules which, if they do make the protoliving universe what it is, are counter to the trust life moves by. This trust is of her own making, and that is definitely a contradiction of the statistical. To go back to the sculptor, his action is the opposite of casual labor if he hopes to conclude his effort with something meaningful such as a form, a destined entity.   </li></ol><p>   Architecture is in the process of becoming the physical definition of a multilevel, human ecology. It will be arc-ology. Arcology, instrumented by science and technology, will be an aesthetocompassionate phenomenon.

I have adopted two Biblical names to maintain a semantic tie to the past. However, in any general consideration of the Babels and the Noahs, there is more than semanticism involved. Most of the other names are combinations of the term arcology and a new term referring to a morphological, structural, or functional characteristic of the system. If up to this point I have failed to assert the concept of genesis as the central import of life, I am too late to explain it now. May the names used be of some help.  </p><p>   This is not a suggestion for implanting an arcology in the middle of an existing city. It might be worth mentioning, nevertheless, that if an arcology were to be conceived for an <q>urban renewal,</q> one great asset would be the nondislocation of the population at the beginning of the process; in fact, only 3 to 4 per cent of the future population of the arcology would have to move at all before transfer into the new structure.  </p><p>   The diagrams must be read as follows: If the density of the population contained in the large circle were to become equal to the density of the population of the arcology (symbolized in the small circle), such population (of the large circle) would be contained in an arcological system of which the horizontal projection would be equivalent to the small circle. It must be clear that the symbol of the arcology in the small circle is not in scale. It only symbolizes a density of population.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-045.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>London</td><td>27/hectare</td><td>11/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#babelnoah">Babelnoah</a></td><td>822/hectare</td><td>333/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-046.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-047.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>Mexico City</td><td>22/hectare</td><td>9/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#babeldiga">Babeldiga</a></td><td>1,643/hectare</td><td>665/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>New York City</td><td>82/hectare</td><td>33/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#hexahedron">Hexahedron</a></td><td>2,964/hectare</td><td>1,200/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-049.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>Chicago</td><td>64/hectare</td><td>26/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#arcube">Arcube</a></td><td>2,717/hectare</td><td>1,100/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-050.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>Phoenix</td><td>8.3/hectare</td><td>3.3/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#babel-2b">Babel IIB</a></td><td>662/hectare</td><td>268/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-051.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>Tokyo</td><td>124/hectare</td><td>50/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#novanoah-2">Novanoah B</a></td><td>852/hectare</td><td>345/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-052.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td>Delhi</td><td>179/hectare</td><td>72/acre</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#arcodiga">Arcodiga</a></td><td>1,331/hectare</td><td>538/acre</td></tr></tbody></table></figcaption></figure><p>   Schedule sequence of an archology, the size, bulk and complexity of the undertaking warrants the establishment of a vast building industry to be later partially converted.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-053.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Phase 1: Selection of Site (Time: Months–Years)   </figcaption></figure><ul><li>Ecological Survey</li><li>Social and economical survey</li><li>Regional and state linkage via rail, road, air, radio, power station, water, gas…</li></ul><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-054.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Phase 2: Excavation and Quarrying (Time: Months)   </figcaption></figure><p>   Production of building materials: sand, gravel, stone, (cement) production of new topography and foundation platform.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>    Phase 3: Instrumentation of the Grounds (Time: Months)   </figcaption></figure><p>   Tooling for the production of standard and custom-made structural and utility elements.

Will we, in other words, have a mechanistic sea civilization indifferent to humaneness, taking the food without the substance?

That is to say that, though man moves into the seas in his quest for food and material, he does it with open eyes, and in his exploitation he carries those same elements that exploitation feeds and perpetuates.  </p><p>   In other words, he does not just exploit the new environment, he works and lives in it, by it, with it. This is not in order to make the sea a more <q>humane</q> element, though this may be very fundamental in the long run, but because a new world opens to him who is by nature a world-maker. In this new environment, not only enormous but also very dense in its fluid layers, the arcology must deepen its structure, reaching thus, as by a cross section of the ecological mass, to all the variants of which it is composed and by which it is enriched.  </p><p>   The arcology, like an enormous digestive system, would ingest the mass of water, extract from it the elements designated by the function of the diverse plants, and eliminate the used water in an uninterrupted cycle. The different materials—vegetable and animal, chemical and mineral—once trapped, would be processed and/or stored, then in part consumed, in part exported as food, fertilizer, and so on, or used as material for production of goods.  </p><p>   The necessity for man to move into the sea, pushed by the biological flood rising ‘within’ him and the riches contained in the seas themselves, suggests the genesis of a floating civilization with nodular centers constructed within floating arcologies. The buoyant section of these would furnish frames and spaces for the automated processing plants of (1) food stuff, animal and vegetal, (2) water, and (3) minerals and chemicals. Oceanographic labs and labs for underwater-life development would also find ideal facilities and pertinent environment.  </p><p>   The upper structures would be for living, learning, and working. There would be vertical transportation systems, as in <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#babel-2a">Babel II</a> and horizontal transportation systems on and under water freed from the slavery of <q>roads,</q> Novanoah could drift with the currents or be slowly <q>propelled</q> on short or long journeys according to seasons, seas, harvests, fishing opportunities, or vacation cruises. Such arcologies would appeal strongly to overcrowded countries, sun-starved countries, sea labor unions hard pressed by automation, steel and aluminum corporations, chemical corporations, shipbuilders….  </p><p>   Novanoah I could develop by concentric rings starting from the central canister. While <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#novanoah-2">Novanoah II</a> is a water city with open-air, surface navigation, Novanoah I has interiorized waterways as it has interiorized gardens. The structural system, a hollow tubular space frame, indicates and carries the transportation and transfer systems. The productive and storing programs are developed in the lower parts of the system.  </p><p>   It might be worth noticing that with the concepts of miniaturization, congruence, and tridimensionality derived from the structural and functional investigations conducted while defining the arcologies, the Novanoahs are still defined by the restricted concept of the power vested in the vertical dimension. The rules of buoyancy naturally have their part in this timidity.

Preparation may not be the best word for the counterfeiting of things, thoughts, and emotions, ebulliently proposed and enforced by the quasi-automatism of business, gross national product, and so on—and the golden cage is not so golden yet.  </p><p>   The case here is that perhaps a metamorphosis of the protogilded encasement for an asphyxiating society may mean uncovering of a different set of values, better aligned with the basic tenderness of the human constitution.  </p><p>   As such tenderness is backed by the infinite boldness of life itself, bold has to be the action reaching out to sustain and regroup the harassed members of the human species.  </p><p>   As the shelter for consciousness cannot be simply and solely a rational engine, the new Babel cannot be a machine for living.  </p><p>   If man can be called, in technical jargon, a seeking and suffering machine, the envelope of his seeking and suffering cannot be but a suffering, that is, a super-rational engine. I have called such entity an aesthetocompassionate phenomenon.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-babel2a-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Babel IIA (Flat or marshy land)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>650/hectare</td><td>263/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1,150 meters</td><td>3,773 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>1,250 hectares</td><td>3,085 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Beautiful is the evaluative and final judgement for any endeavor, be it in science, religion, philosophy, or morals. The ugliness, uniquely human, of the deed of reverent man is nothing but the failure of his not-less-unique trust in search of the aesthetic, the function of his manipulation of nature—a nature obviously neutral but, to the eyes of aesthetic man, now beautiful, now not so. Quite possibly then, it was not a hypothetical God who tore down Babel, but technical man himself. Unable to see beyond the instrumentality of his undertaking, he became a stranger to himself, foreclosing understanding and communication. His gasping in the proto-aesthetic world of the machine for living, procured him only loneliness and squalor, the same loneliness and squalor of the neomagic world of today.  </p><p>   It may well take another disaster of universal proportion, the flood of the gadget, for instance, or the mushroom-cloud resolution, for man to shake his soul away from the idols of matter-rational sufficiency and realize that rationality is only a partial answer.  </p><p>   The Babel of modern times is a technicality in search of purpose, a purpose it is destined not to find until the day when its subaltern position is understood and framed in the society technicality is meant to serve. This is, in turn, unachievable unless the credulity of man in the neomagic pose of technology is deflated to its proportion, a proportion to be found in coherent use for purposes that are real inasmuch as they are historically adequate to the position of man within nature.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-babel2a-3.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Babel IIA (Flat or marshy land)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>650/hectare</td><td>263/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1,150 meters</td><td>3,773 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>1,250 hectares</td><td>3,085 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

The farmer, surrounded by a nature that is ever more identified with a sluggish machine for production, finds himself hostile toward it and less and less awed by its pervasiveness. Farming as industry is an extreme case of tenuity. Its deminiaturized performance is besetting the life of the farm people. While technological mystique has all but obliterated the reverential demeanor of the farmer toward nature, this same technology has not only given no solution to the farmer&#39;s loneliness and cultural pauperism (TV and radio) but has used efficiency as a way of scattering the society of the land tenant into ever more inaccessible community centers, centers nagged by rampant provincialism.  </p><p>   With the disappearance of the small farmer, the population has demultiplied, and the village has been replaced by the supermarket, a market for urban goods, not for soil products. Of all men, the farmer is the most disenchanted toward nature, and at the same time his enchantment with progress is confined to those instruments that in growing numbers are encasing him in the megamachine of the industrial complex. A reversal of the farmer migration toward urban centers is not desirable unless the farmer is given a good alternative for the satisfaction of his longing for human and social intercourse.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcvillage1-2.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcvillage I (Farm land)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>741/hectare</td><td>300/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>220 meters</td><td>722 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>12.25 hectares</td><td>30 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

The only way this is feasible is to maintain communities large enough to sustain and encourage urban institutions. An area of about 10,000 square miles could sustain an urban center of about 100,000, placing the city-farmer at no more than 50 miles away from his land. The center&#39;s attraction would have to be sufficient to engender th in the farmer&#39;s family an irresistible desire to live there and not on the land under cultivation.  </p><p>   A town cannot sustain its life if it is only a market place or a recreation center. It has to be lived in. At a time when most of the utensils of domesticity and production are no longer made locally, by people, but in far places and anonymously, when food seems to be manufactured by witches, brought in from no place—and one cannot recognize a pea if it does not spill from Mother Box—in times such as these the life of a town cannot be sustained by warehouses and storage places.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcvillage1-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcvillage I (Farm land)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>741/hectare</td><td>300/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>220 meters</td><td>722 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>12.25 hectares</td><td>30 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

The impersonal character invested in the market transaction is a reflection of the anonymity of the goods transacted. This anonymity is now so great as to penetrate even the school room. Thus the farmer and his family move from an often grim confrontation with nature to a no less grim confrontation with anonymous if shiny collectivism.  </p><p>   Humanization of the farm town can only be obtained by a healthy mixture of people, some living and working there, some living there and working their farms. For the single farmer wrestling with nature, staying on the farm might be right. If the farmer has a family, then he might find it desirable to live in the stream of the body-social. He has such a right. In any case, as things are now, this right is denied. It is worth notice that in the total ecology of the city and its farms, the car has a real place. There would be a daily pulsation as many people would fan out from the city to the farms and return in the evening without the road overloads caused by suburban sprawl.  </p><p>   The farming proceeds from the village to the open countryside with (1) vegetable gardens at the foot of the arcology, to (2) gardens, to (3) orchard, to (4) grain farming.

For minds rightly turning, Logology would be the quintessence of urbanity, of worldliness, if to be of the world is to have an almost physical awareness of the universal battle put up by life to affirm its own staying power. If this industry of the mind is not also the industry of man, then Logology would be a neomonster organizing new mythological plays. In Logology the heavy industry section is absent. The industry of the mind is a light industry.  </p><p>   In a sense this arcology would be the least specialized, inasmuch as the spectrum of things covered by the working of the mind is potentially limitless. Another characteristic would be a flourishing of manual activities to balance the tendential abstractness of the mental processes. Artisan and craft occupations would be widespread, environmental, a labor of love, not on the level of toil by coercion and the occupational tedium of a therapeutic limbo.  </p><p>   Logology is a double organism, the slab and the bowl. The slab, a series of juxtaposed platforms, is linear, monosexual or asexual. The bowl, a complex cellular conocylinder, is curvilinear, bisexual. The curvilinear is quite clearly composed of radiating elements, the masculine, and enveloping elements, the feminine. When this bivalence is not spoken clearly, the curvilinear tends to be redundant because it becomes functionally ineffective. This is evident in small units, rooms or houses where the latitude demanded by the radial aspect is not present. The mating is contrived; the conception fails.  </p><p>   In the rectilinear this double aspect is absent. There is a singularity of definition that in a way adds order to the system and at times makes it appear stronger. The linear geometry is undoubtedly simpler, conceptually and constructionally. There are, however, goals that simplicity does not foster.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-logology-2.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Logology (Hilly land; flood condition)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>900,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>950/hectare</td><td>344/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>900 meters</td><td>2,953 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>1,034 hectares</td><td>2,550 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

It sees and reflects upon itself as an organism could if conjunctly hollowed out and endowed with a capacity for inner observation. There is the passive reflection from a mirror or the engaged reflection from, for instance, the human face. The second is the kind of reflection that activates the living. That one sees what one does not like to see, demands far more reflection, not less of it. Nonplenitude, the reflection of scarcity, is the dissatisfaction which urges new deeds and the relative efforts that they demand.  </p><p>   The lack of reflection cancels one&#39;s own physiognomy. Man and society are more and more at a loss for lack of such physiognomy and the willingness to reflect on it. Cubism with its distraught rearrangements started to suggest that what we saw as wholes were possibly not only made up of parts but also that such parts might be ill-fitted for each other. After such disturbing reflection, refraction, and diffraction, followed the tearing and mutilating of the elements closer to every-day life. that which the artist sees, environment is. To find a coördination of the environment and to offer reflectivity, better reflection, is to reactivate a need for coherence.  </p><p>   In Babel IIC there is a recoördination in the landscape and, one hopes, a better grade of reflectivity.  </p><p>   This is, though, the kind of reflection that does not advocate a disemboweled organism. The novelty of seeing a person draped by his own 36 feet of digestive tract does not present much more than a vague recollection of things not yet well composed, and the jolt that such an apparition causes in an individual whose entrails are contained, stored away, in a more suitable place is only the natural reaction of coherence in the presence of noncoherence. For the <q>expose-all</q> functionalist here is a reminder that the entrails of our buildings, far from being sophisticated packages of functions, are gross, overextended, overstated, inefficient, pretentious gadgets—very much like a swollen respiratory and digestive system whose structure and co-ordination may wel be doomed in a short, very short, time.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-babel2c-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Babel IIC (On open mining pit)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>340,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>1,396/hectare</td><td>565/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>850 meters</td><td>2,789 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Diameter</td><td>1,750 meters</td><td>5,741 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>240 hectares</td><td>595 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

It may be more appropriately the grasping of wholes in their significance. Physically speaking, the Babel IIC society sees and reflects upon itself. The whole of the city is constructed around a large volume so that as the citizen is or moves in and along one part of that city, all the rest of it displays itself at his feet around him, above him, in visual as well as in physical reach. This enveloping of a huge space by the megastructure and the <q>reflective</q> quality of the infrastructure are producing an inner <q>landscape</q> never before experienced by mankind; a premonition, one could say, of a man-made asteroid world where the living space is not on the surface of the planet but contained within the skin of the asteroid itself (see <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#asteromo">Asteromo</a>).  </p><p>   The residential grounds built in the thickness of the floor and the rest of the arcology, so to speak, are positioning citizens on the border between this inner landscape and the <q>outside</q> world that, by the nature of the arcology, is not cluttered by housing and blight. Each vertical structure, the size of which is the order of our largest skyscrapers, carries vertical circulation and transportation to its two main stations in the thickness of the aforementioned floor and roof of the arcology. From there, circulation and transportation develop in the slanting many layers to feed the numerous substructures of public and private life. Within the thickness (70 meters) and richness of such layers (floor and roof) are the neighborhoods. They number those people who for nearness, affinity, and common utilities tend to form a microcommunity contained with the other neighborhoods by the macrocommunity. Because of the very short time and space gaps between any two elements of the city, the neighborhoods do not need their own separate center of great complexity and sophistication.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-babel2c-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Babel IIC (On open mining pit)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>340,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>1,396/hectare</td><td>565/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>850 meters</td><td>2,789 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Diameter</td><td>1,750 meters</td><td>5,741 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>240 hectares</td><td>595 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Let&#39;s exemplify this with the health service:  </p><ol><li>    Home care of noncritical patients will not only be possible but preferable inasmuch as any specialized personnel, from doctors to nurses, can almost instantaneously be on the spot when they are needed. The family doctor may have his own comeback in functional terms. A nurse can care for many patients; instead of room to room, she moves from home to home without the intermediate obstacles of weather, traffic, cost, time… and exhaustion. This fact alone will cut into the mammoth size of general hospitals and specialized clinics.   </li><li>    The possibility of quick interaction between separate institutions of health through the structural co-ordination of the city and the minimal distances so defined makes possible any amount of desirable decentralization.   </li></ol><p>   In a real sense the location of the health facilities and the location of any other function will not be crucial. The intrinsic efficiency and quality of the institutions will be crucial, not their location in the community, inasmuch as the linkage between homes and institutions is axiomatic with the morphology of the city itself. There will not be such a thing as a home site poorly served by health or any other facility because of distance or obstacles. This constitutional flexibility is the fundamental dynamism that characterizes arcology.  </p><p>   Manufacturing will be mostly in the underground <q>universal spaces,</q> administration and offices within the vertical structures. In the upper crown are grouped most of the high-learning facilities. The grounds below the city are given to playgrounds, promenades, parks, and gardens.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcanyon-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcanyon (Any type of land structure)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population per kilometer</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>864/hectare</td><td>350/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>300–500 meters</td><td>984–1,640 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>46.5 hectares per linear kilometer</td><td>69.6 acres per linear mile</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Only the vast energies of the sun can redeem the constant downflow of water (and energy) occurring on and in every parcel of land on the earth.  </p><p><em>For centuries the aqueduct has on the one hand battled gravity and on the other has used it to give purpose to down-running water.</em> The aqueduct, by gauging energy, makes of water the conveyor of life. In this lies the magic of guiding the flow of water along a dike or a canal. It is leashed entropy made to work every inch of the way for the purposefulness of life.  </p><p>   The aqueduct can feed in clusters or feed homogeneously. Homogeneous feeding gives to each energetic (down) step its own reward of life-giver, as each downstep will never see its own reversal in its own contained, isolated system. Then the guidance of the flow in its spreading over wholeness combined with the homogeneous uninterrupted feeding of life seems to be an efficient, energetic system, granted enough water and meaningful display of living continuity.  </p><p>   in Arcanyon, the aqueduct is populated all the way. At intervals, nodular centers have a denser life on which would converge adjacent portions of activities form both the upper and the lower basins. Waterways at three different levels are incorporated in a macrostructure of constant organization but with sizes and arrangements varied to indicate possible flexibility and feasible differentiations. The head of Arcanyon is at a water reservoir (dam) where the intakes of the canals (waterways) are located. From Arcanyon along its deployment are branching-off aqueducts to feed the various arcologies.  </p><p>   Arcanyon is only the progenitor of a far more complex and powerful urban river on which a longitudinal axis would develop a multilevel transportation network topped by an endless airport. On the side of this flow system urbanization would develop on a square kilometer section on each side. (See <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#p1-ch2">Map of Despair</a>.) With a strong hierarchy of neighborhood, local, regional, and continental transportation systems all welded or grafted into the flow system, a total mobility would be achieved without interfering with urban, biped life.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcanyon-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcanyon (Any type of land structure)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population per kilometer</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>864/hectare</td><td>350/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>300–500 meters</td><td>984–1,640 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>46.5 hectares per linear kilometer</td><td>69.6 acres per linear mile</td></tr><tr><td>1.

It does not do away with them, principally because (1) air conditioning does not have an ecological roundness, that is to say, it is segregative by its very nature; (2) by failing to demand from the building itself those elements of congruence with the climate that would render total conditioning redundant, it does not work with the positive aspects of the climate; (3) air conditioning is a large figure in the cost of a building, the compensatory economy being a cut into other and possibly more important aspects of the total configuration.  </p><p>   Auxiliarity of the natural and the man-produced must be observed. This ecological complementarity is in the long run the only position that might let man prevail over things. Great mass and profound shadows procure relief from the extremes of temperature.

It is a configuration that reflects the reciprocal interworking of sun and earth from the particular position man stands for in it. The apse is in other words that topography that serves man well in his own cosmic pattern. The low elliptical path of the sun in winter makes its rays penetrate the spherical space of the apse. The high elliptical path of the summer sun causes the apse to project a large volume of shade within its spherical space. This dual function, a sun trap in winter and sun shade in summer, is the reason for the use of the apse in a climate with a long and harsh winter.  </p><p>   The central apse in Arcollective is 200 meters in diameter. On the north side a snow drift, natural or induced, would work as insulation against the very low winter temperatures. The north envelope of silos would also serve the same purpose. The areas sheltered by the large apse and the four smaller pseudo-apses would in sunny winter days be relatively comfortable grounds for outdoor activities, not the least of which is play.  </p><p>   For a larger community, the use of more inner spaces would tend to reduce the significance of the apse as a climate producer. The organism would count more on its mass inertia and the generation and use of endogenous energy.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-veladiga-1.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Veladiga (Dam site)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>309/hectare</td><td>125/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>250 meters</td><td>820 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>48 hectares</td><td>120 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

A dam is as large as the transformations it produces. The sense of locality and useful coercion that springs from it need to be lived by man because they are essentially transfigurative. What else in construction beside bridges and other water-retaining structures can compare in forcefulness, size, purpose, grandeur?

The dam is a case in point. Purity and simplicity have caged designers, engineers, and construction workers in an isolation box where there is really no room for man, as there will be no room for him in the finished masonry. We do divert rivers, move and remove mountains with our hands. Why should we not put our minds and hearts in it and live by it also? These structures are begging for life.  </p><p>   To introduce living and working into the masonry of the dam means to transform a monolithic, noncellular system into one that is articulated and cellular. For equal mass the cellular system, not randomly given but structurally conceived, is stronger because it allows selectivity of orientation and dimensionality.  </p><p>   If one then considers the 1:7 ratio of redundance in the safety coefficient in the dams built in the United States, one can see the wealth of schemes that can effectively and magnificently transform the blind mass into a singing environment.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcodiga-2.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcodiga (Dam site)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>280,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>1,331/hectare</td><td>538/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>750 meters</td><td>2,461 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>260 hectares</td><td>640 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

The city becomes the connecting link between the two rims of a large canyon.  </p><p>   Anyone familiar with the Grand Canyon understands how the two rims could be not 2 miles but 2,000 miles apart. The physical chasm is also a geographic, social, and cultural chasm. One rim is totally foreign to the other. By establishing a connection where separation was, the whole regional balance is transformed. If then this connection is not just a roadway but a fully developed urban system, one can see the revolutionary possibilities of the concept. And yet it fits well the historical framework that has seen both multifunctional brides and the flourishing of cities along rivers and along the major axes of communication.  </p><p>   Stonebow is to be seen in this context as the waistline of a thicker and more complex configuration of activities extending almost indefinitely from both ends of the arcology. In this way the geological phenomenon will be both lived in and tamed by man.  </p><p>   For an organism bridging deeper canyons than the one suggested here, there would be a vertical climate variance as it is experienced in the Grand Canyon, where one finds botanical specimens of the tropics and of the tundras a few hundred meters apart. To remind man of the miracle of life emerging and perpetuating itself in endless ways is not a fringe benefit for urban man. It is one of the cultural aspects of a truly civilized condition.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-stonebow-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Stonebow (Above ravine or canyon)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>1,482/hectare</td><td>600/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>150–450 meters</td><td>492–1,476 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Span</td><td>900 meters</td><td>2,953 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>129 hectares</td><td>316 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

If one considers that wind, rain, cold, and heat do not change, one might see the advantage of cave dwelling for some particular group of man, even today. The combination of cave dwelling and metropolitan sophistication could be fruitful. The actual sheltering device, an impressive roof for the whole community, is there—a gaping hollow in the side of the cliff. The combination of good layout, mouth preferably open to the south, good coordination of material and artificial light, good radiant and convection heat systems can make the whole cave a most exciting place to live and work in. Industrial plants could be carved into the rock along with housing and storage. A number of shafts from the rim plateau are for access and light and air control, shafts that drop down to the floor of the valley connecting the city to gardens, parks, or water bodies.  </p><p>   Of all man&#39;s activities, it is automated production that will move inside the earth&#39;s crust. Efficiency, safety, compactness (miniaturization), and the use of the surface of the earth for other things will force automated production under the ground. Large systems are already set in many functional layers of different kinds, most of them for communication, transportation, and storage. Production will join them and then oust the transportation system, as this will move to various levels of the city.  </p><p>   The critical aspect of cave dwelling is the strong orientation that the mouth of the cave defines. The morning and the afternoon have far more specific meaning than is usually the case; in general, there is a quasi-symmetry defined by the noon hour so that to every morning hour corresponds an afternoon hour. This symmetry is lowest in the cave configuration almost as a reflection of the absence of the hypothetical half of the cave cut away to open the remaining half to light, air, and view.  </p><p>   Cave dwelling is as old and as constant as the history of mankind. I am considering that cave dwelling which has been made famous on this continent by the Indians, what may be called the open- or half-cave dwelling communities; that is to say, not a sequence of underground spaces but the use of a deep shelf on the wall of a canyon.  </p><p>   Such topography is the free gift of (1) a collective umbrella: the ceiling of the half cave is the roof above the roofs; (2) a temperature control device for optimum orientation: directly south, the cave is a winter sun trap and a summer parasol; (3) a wind- and air-flow device; (4) an all-embracing space of very inspiring character; something of a concrete and acting symbol of the historical process that has made stone and flesh in one.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-theology-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Theology (Cliff topography)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>13,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>378/hectare</td><td>153/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>100–560 meters</td><td>328–1,837 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>34 hectares</td><td>83 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Now that automatism of the mental is menacingly appearing as a pale reflection of the burgeoning monster flower of automation, nothing would serve man better than a restoration, on necessarily new levels, of the psychological and mental primacy of the species. The new monastery must be the secular city, or at least its core, the learning center.  </p><p><b>Investigation</b></p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-theology-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Theology (Cliff topography)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>13,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>378/hectare</td><td>153/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>100–560 meters</td><td>328–1,837 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>34 hectares</td><td>83 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

To distinguish grossly the two generations, the first one would be the Dionysian kind, the second, the Apollonian. Of the fifteen or so schemes I have of the Apollonian kind, I am including Arcube and Hexahedron in this volume as the overture to a possible second volume. That would include the urban river referred to before (<a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#p1-ch2">Map of Despair</a>). The Apollonian generation is characterized by the envelope which is substantially in elementary geometry: cube, sphere, pyramid, hexahedron, cylinder, etc.  </p><p>   In the Dionysian generation, filiation of Mesa City, are configurations of a more <q>free form</q> character. Functionally speaking, it might be hard to put one in front of the other. The so-called free form has definite dangers: there is the danger of unbalance and the danger of the pseudo-organic. Unbalance results whenever for the sake of nonsymmetry there is a lopsided density of action that will soon result in hyperfunctions in some places and atrophy in others. In nature symmetry is used to balance uneven conditions, for instance, a tree growing against a wall so as to reproduce a symmetry of performances inclusive of the unbalancing cause.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-hexahedron-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Hexahedron (Any topography)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>170,000</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>2,964/hectare</td><td>1,200/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1 kilometer</td><td>3,281 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>57 hectares</td><td>140 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

The micro-environment that allows the cell to act is a reflection on and a determinant of the cell&#39;s own structural and functional characteristics. Exclusive of these characteristics are sight, hearing, smalling, feeling, unpredictability, and so on. It is not that a cell has none of these characteristics but that those that it has are only approximately comparable to the corresponding ones in a complex organism. Then, for instance, to blow up an artery and pretend to run people in it as if they were blood cells is not very logical. It is to take form at face value and miss the substance of the problem and its predicaments.  </p><p>   The organic has defined itself in the long interim between the mineral and the mental, and the beauty of its power is somehow contained there. The organization of the inorganic to construct a container to the condition of man is thus turned upon a specific and not organic structurality, a postorganic structure and indeed a pseudostructure compared with the miraculous order off the mineral and the living. This is why such pseudostructures, purely functional and always on the threshold of obsolescence, must find redemption in form, the aesthetic side of compassionate man. Morphologically and structurally, Hexahedron is, like <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/document/76#arcube">Arcube</a>, a pseudocrystal.

For it the conditions are harsher, the problems more packaged, the survival-success story more elemental, and the hypothesis slightly less human than one might desire. However, what is built in is not so much the fraud of simulation as the frugality of investigation.  </p><p>   Lunacy is part of man&#39;s burden. Thus, while man dies on earth through hunger and malice, he works feverishly at the encounter with the black naught of space. He will need out there a real machine for living. Man and his earthly morphological confinement is a dead duck in space. He will be stuffed into a superlung, wrapped by superdigestive tracts, governed by superchemical brains. He will not look into the crystal ball; he will be inside it. Life will be interiorized, not psychologically but physically: the life inside, not the life on (the earth). The center or the axis of the machine will be the center of gravity. Man&#39;s head will point at it, not his feet.  </p><p>   Should man take with him out there, beside his biological condition, anything else that has a biological flavor? He may have to, while nurturing his expectation for a non-biological self. He may have to for his physical and mental health. Miniaturization is the password to the fantastic voyage. For a long time symbolism will be the real context of space life, the testing of events to come and not necessarily of space events but of more pressing earthly problems—the miniaturization of the performance of the human race on the <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space ship earth</a>.  </p><p>   Asteromo is an asteroid for a population of about 70,000 people.

The foundation is engaged in the betterment of man&#39;s condition and in conservation of nature, inasmuch as they both depend on the creation of efficient and humane cities. The foundation is investigating new urban patterns and the structural system necessary to their existence. In moving to the second part of the program, the foundation intends to begin the construction of a new complex that will apply and test elements of such patterns and structures at the small end, so to speak, of the urban scale. Because of the physical, cultural, and ethical impasse man has arrived at, I consider this undertaking as necessary, essential, and urgent as any program concerning man.  </p><p>   By going into this second phase, the foundation moves from a micro to a macro scale. Micro-Cosanti has established its own validity by the progress of growth that has taken place in the last six years and by the influence of its work. The activities that have occupied tens of people are now to be developed in such a way as to involve hundreds. This tenfold increase is not arbitrary. It is the congruous step from a concern directed at the family unit to a concern for a social group. I am urbanizing the Cosanti Foundation. It will be a Macro-Cosanti. Then in the larger design that I have been developing, Cosanti will fit as a fiber of direct feasibility.  </p><figure><a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/docs/paolo-soleri/arcology-arcosanti-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Arcosanti (Mesa topography)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Population</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Density</td><td>531/hectare</td><td>215/acre</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>50 meters</td><td>164 feet</td></tr><tr><td>Surface covered</td><td>2.8 hectares</td><td>7 acres</td></tr><tr><td>1.

We are groping, groping or dying, a thing that must enter the minds of policymakers, powerholders, planners, and architects.) It will be experimental but not haphazard; in fact, there is an overriding discipline. The valid foundation for urban life is the open acceptance of the same tenets guiding any other form of a supercomplex interworking of purposes and functions, the extreme compactness of the physical system that sustains and supports them.  </p><p>   There is a structure of things that must be sought in a degree directly proportional to the degree of complexity of such things. The avalanche of life and <q>goods</q> that is cascading on us is begging for a structure. Meaningfulness is not something that extravagantly comes into being. Nothing in the universe has such kindness in store for man, nor can we seriously desire such casual demiurgy.  </p><p>   If it is true that there are structural priorities that every civilization must define for itself, then to make sense out of our physical environment has a very urgent call for priority.

The main concern of the community-school is investigation of and experimentation with arcological concepts. This design is for a community of about 1,500 people. It covers 6 acres and is about 150 feet high. Its module is the individual rather than the family because a high percentage of the population would be students and apprentices.

For our spherical (elliptical) cosmography the structural morphology (parts of it) is spherical (curved). The reason for making this dependence is not farfetched because in the Cosanti Foundation many of the activities are to be developed in sheltered-but-open spaces.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Imagine this: you’re looking at a new codebase, and you want to find the code for a specific function.</p><p>For example, in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">create-react-app</a> codebase,</p><p>How quickly can you find a test for <code>react-dev-utils</code>?</p><div><p>facebook/create-react-app</p></div><p>That wasn’t terribly difficult, but it also probably took a bit of time and exploration. Can we do better?</p><p>Instead of the typical folders &amp; files view, we can create a visual representation of the code. Below, I&#39;ve visualized the same repository, but instead of a directory structure, each file and folder as a circle: the circle’s color is the type of file, and the circle’s size represents the size of the file.</p><div><div><div><div><div><svg viewBox="0 0 1200 700"><defs><filter id="glow" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="4"

<p>I am <s>broke</s> “non-liquid” right now. Normally, that sentence doesn’t have geopolitical ramifications on the creation of hybrid private-public surveillance state. But in my case it does.</p>



<p>It started rather innocuously. Someone couldn’t send me money. No matter what they did. They couldn’t transfer any money. Curious. We started experimenting with different friends, companies, and acquaintances. None of them could send me me money. <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> wouldn’t provide any explanation. My business had been a paying customer for more than ~4+ years. And now, I was locked out. Okay. They’re hardly the only fish in the sea.</p>



<p>Except it happened again. This time with our bank, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>. Okay, that’s strange. They asked for more details. We sent them details. Scans of my documentation. They’d revert back a few days later for more details. And we’d send it to them again. On and on we went chasing each other around the maypole. A few weeks passed, and Mercury’s team finally cut to the chase, they asked if I was affiliated with Entity X. We said no. But it didn’t matter. They froze me out anyway.</p>



<p>In some ways, we’re lucky that they flagged the transfer, because they gave us the first clue of what was going on. A friend ended up having the insight to search for Entity X (thanks Nick!) and found that <em>they’d been sanctioned</em>. Okay. What did this have to do with me?</p>



<p>On further investigation, we found that I shared my legal name with someone working with Entity X. Great. It’s a common name, like Robert Brown or Mary Johnson. Shouldn’t it be easy to prove that I’m not person X? A little Googling later, I found that the United States Department of the Treasury has an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and they have an email address for “reconsideration” if you’ve been mistakenly placed on the sanctions list. As I’m clearly not the person they were looking to sanction, I decided that the most logical course of action would be write to them, and get their assent that I am indeed not the human that they’re looking for.</p>



<p>We wrote something up (once again, thanks Nick). And we sent it in.</p>



<p>The OFAC replied, to their credit, quite promptly with a link for false positives, and they told me to send this to the bank. Okay. Done. Except, it didn’t matter. Mercury blocked me anyway. The saga finished with me getting nada.</p>



<p>I wrote back to the OFAC requesting them to write something, anything on an official looking letterhead stating the simple fact that I, Person X born on such and such date with an ID number of Z, am not the person who has been sanctioned. I offered to provide them with additional details if there was any hesitancy on their part.</p>



<p>They haven’t replied. And I still can’t get any cash.</p>



<p>What’s amazing about this saga is that I have a statistically common legal name. There are thousands of people running around with this name. And effectively, they’ve <em>all</em> been barred from the global financial system.</p>



<p>To their credit, the OFAC publishes additional details for each person to prevent this exact scenario from occurring. However, these details seem to vary across individuals and countries. It doesn’t seem to be a neat dataset to model. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists" target="_blank">the lists are available online in .PDF and .TXT files,</a> and it’s a mess. Also, there isn’t one list, but rather multiple lists, with different details. As far as I can tell, there is no <em>official</em> API. There is no efficient way for programmers designing, say a “[bank] built for startups” to comply with the Treasury. Consequently, someone decided, in a meeting room somewhere, to punt the problem.</p>



<p>If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just run a simple match against the name – the one element of the dataset guaranteed to be there – and then punt it to our underpaid and understaffed KYC department to deal with? And the KYC department punted it to legal. And legal took one look and went, “hrm, what’s our downside risk if we approve this? Do we know this person is indeed the one being sanctioned? Oh, I see. Well let’s just block them. There’s not much they can do about it.”</p>



<p>And so, I am currently <s>broke</s> non-liquid. Kafka would have been proud.</p>



<p><em>(for connoisseurs of dark humor, I find it particularly hilarious that more likely than not the person they’re targeting will never be affected by this. This person, with whom I have the misfortune of sharing a legal name, doesn’t seem to perform many international transactions. She lives in a cash-first developing country, where the sanctions have no reach. She’s but a lowly piece in a very big game)</em></p>

<p>In other news, Apple has decided to scan images on your phone. For child porn, of course. There aren’t enough people (nor PR capital) to look through all of your photos. So, they’ve done the efficient thing instead. They’re simply going to match all of your photos, on your phone, against a hash of child porn images. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Other, more eloquent commentators,</a> have pointed out the danger this poses. Apple often bends over for authoritarian regimes like China, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/technology/apple-hong-kong-app.html">remove apps that help pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong avoid police violence</a>. Or, that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned">the company doesn’t allow adults to view adult content on the devices that they own</a>. Or, in more conservative countries, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avng9/apple-is-letting-over-150-countries-censor-lgbtq-content-in-the-app-store">removing any apps that mention the inconvenient existence of LGBTQ+ people</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">Wikipedia has an exhaustive list.</a></p>



<p>However, it is not my purpose to repeat what these commentators have already said. Nor to write a polemic for its own sake. My goal is to use my experience to peer into the future. To predict, through inevitability, the chain of events for poor souls in days yet to pass.</p>



<p>Just like the programmers who chose to match names against the sanctions list, while the KYC and legal departments handle the rest, Apple is matching all of the private photos on your phone against a list. This list is generated using something called a hash function. It turns an image into a number that a computer can then use to make the comparison. The process looks a bit like this, </p>







<p>Please note this is an example from a lovely blog that goes through this process. Apple’s process is different, but inherently similar.</p>



<p>In most cases, when we’re dealing with hashes in computer science, we’re looking for exact matches. But this case is different. Criminals aren’t stupid. They’re often not clever, but not all of them are stupid. What if they add a filter? Or, change the image somehow? Maybe add in a blur? What then?</p>



<p>Well, clearly, they can’t make every variation possible of every image that the police are looking for. If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just look for <em>similarity</em> instead and then punt it to law enforcement to deal with? To put it another way, the question Apple is asking isn’t, “is this image exactly like this photo from the child porn database?” No, the question Apple is asking is, “is this image similar to this photo from the child porn database?” Where the “similar” question is answered by a very clever, but very dumb algorithm.</p>



<p>In my case, when the programmers punted to the KYC department and legal, a bunch of transactions were cancelled. In this case, the police will raid your house and arrest you for “child porn.”</p>



<p>The image they will raid you for wouldn’t even necessarily have to be an adult one. Computers are strange. They are very literal beings. They do <em>exactly</em> what they are told, which is both their greatest asset and weakness. For example, this neural network thinks that this cat is guacamole,</p>







<p>Apple’s algorithm is <em>very different</em>, but it is susceptible to the same problems. In this case, noise was added into the image to make the neural network classify the cat as guacamole. In your case, it could be just happenstance. Random noise due to lighting conditions that takes an innocent photo (or, more likely, an intimate photo of you or your partner) and makes the algorithm assume that it is <em>similar</em> to a restricted photo.</p>



<p>Just like me, one day you’ll wake up and notice that something weird might be going on. Maybe it’s a car parked outside your street. Maybe it’s a feeling like people are following you. You won’t be that alarmed at first. You’ll dismiss it. But, eventually, it will come crashing in. Your door will be knocked open by SWAT. And you will find yourself facing armored people in guns to your confusion. They’ll scream for you to raise your hands and put them behind your head. They’ll say, “ma’am we have a warrant for your arrest.” And confused, you’ll be walked out to a waiting squad car.</p>



<p>Your local newspaper will write, “[You] has been arrested for possessing child pornography.” But you won’t read the headline. You’ll be in an interrogation room. Waiting for them to come in. Maybe the officer is letting you sweat it out. Maybe not. But eventually they’ll come in and they’ll start interrogating you. “Ma’am do you consume pornography that has minors in it?”</p>



<p>And you’ll deny it. They’ll put your phone in front of you. It’ll be in one of those bags. You’ll unlock it for them. And you’ll know that they’re going to go through everything. Including that embarrassing pic you took for K.</p>



<p>They won’t find anything. So they’ll return to question you. Maybe you’ve deleted the photos, who knows? Let’s pass it on to forensics and see what they come up with.</p>



<p>Eventually, you’ll end up being detained in jail. Your bail will be set high. You’ll have to plead and explain to everyone around you that you don’t know what’s happening. You don’t know why this happened. And those near you might believe you, but there will be this doubt that crosses through their mind. Just for a second. They’ll have this doubt, and that doubt will always be there for the rest of their life.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough to have money, you’ll get a lawyer. They’ll work on getting you out. Eventually, the forensics will return nothing. Your lawyer will succeed in getting you to walk free. And you’ll walk back to your home, with stares from your neighbors.</p>



<p>In a few months, it’ll come out that no, Apple’s algorithm screwed up here. Apple will blame law enforcement. Law enforcement will blame Apple. It doesn’t matter. That newspaper will put up a small story on their site about how you’re really innocent. It won’t get many clicks. And the one about you getting arrested for possessing child porn will stay up forever. With a note added to it, if you’re lucky.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll get your life back. Maybe not. But you’ll spend the rest of your life under this cloud, because some programmer somewhere wrote this code. And everyone else assumed that it just works.</p>



<hr/>



<p><em>PS – This has already happened many, many times. Except not for something as incendiary as child porn; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399721/uk-post-office-software-bug-criminal-convictions-overturned">Bad software sent postal workers to jail, because no one wanted to admit it could be wrong. </a></em></p>

  <article id="post-81146">
  <!-- /.entry-header -->
  <div>
    <p>A few people have asked me lately what makes for a good podcast.  Since my podcast is far from the most popular, and since most podcasts are not like mine, and do not (and should not) try to be like mine, perhaps I am not the right respondent.  Nonetheless I offered a simple formula:</p>
<p><em>A podcast really works when it is the dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>Or expressed in other words:</p>
<p><em>What makes for a good podcast is the dramatic tension between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>If you think of Russ Roberts at EconTalk, often “the story line” is something like “I am a Mensch and you are a Mensch, and we are going to talk this through together.”  In earlier times, it had more elements of “you are going to put forward some mainstream points, and I am going to push back with market-oriented economics.”</p>
<p>Many of the most famous podcasts are variants of: “We will pretend to be talking about something, but in fact we will exploring new visions of masculinity for a Woke and post-Woke world.”</p>
<p>The visual images and home pages associated with those podcasts are often so…manly.  The T-shirts!  The muscles!  It is also why those podcasts fail so badly at having significant numbers of interesting female guests, addressed on their own terms.</p>
<p>Many episodes of Conversations of Tyler are “I’m going to try to show people just how smart you are, but it will end up a wilder and more precarious ride than you might have thought.”  Occasionally a guest flunks the test (though they might still be smart).  Alternately, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/daniel-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the podcast with Daniel Carpenter</a> was the first episode of “Tyler gets upset at a guest, they really have at it!”</p>
<p>I called my podcast with David Deutsch “weird and testy” — that too is dramatic tension.  One listener <a href="https://twitter.com/jachaseyoung/status/1400254407191580672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>: “Tyler’s delight at having a guest who doesn’t hedge or mealymouth is palpable.”  Few tweeted about the substance of the disagreements.</p>
<p>One woman <a href="https://twitter.com/pupu_tintin/status/1400154143092789252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about it</a>: “Without understanding everything he said, I find myself mentally stimulated &amp; spiritually inspired. Such a purist, an idealist, a truth-seeker w/ religious zeal. Not religious myself, I could see myself eventually submit to his religion”</p>
<p>She meant Deutsch.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1413829597918121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some listeners</a> enjoy how the guests are surprised and delighted by the questions.  With <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alexander-the-grate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander the Grate</a> — the homeless guy — the question was how he would perform at all.  I thought he was excellent and very interesting, but there was real suspense leading up to that point.  “And will Tyler question him just like he does everyone else?”</p>
<p>Get the picture?  I’m not saying these listeners are indifferent to the content, rather they filter it through the unfolding story about the dialogical interaction.  I don’t know of any successful podcasts that violate this principle.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>…some very few podcasts are high level professionals in the same field, with a lot of respect for one another, exploring the space and enjoying each other’s company, especially when effectively “meeting for the first time.” I feel like this is maybe on the order of 1-5% of podcasts I hear. Most podcasts I listen to are “just” very high quality interviews</p></blockquote>
<p>My podcasts with Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss would be examples of that, and there are plenty more out there without yours truly.</p>
<p>So, to use <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansonian rhetoric,</a> “Podcasting isn’t about the podcast!”  If you are seeking to understanding a podcast, including your own, start by asking what the basic story line is.  Where the dramatic tension lies.  Do you have enough dramatic tension in what you are doing?  What is the actual reason why you are not attracting more quality guests of a particular kind?</p>
<p>I am not claiming comparable expertise, but to return to my own endeavors, they are most influenced by: Monty Python’s Flying Circus (especially the interview segments, which maintain remarkable dramatic tension), Seinfeld (wonderful ensemble work), Curb Your Enthusiasm (for how long can you keep people on edge?), and the TNT halftime show with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, etc. (what makes for a dramatic or memorable interjection?).  I doubt those are the right sources for <em>your</em> podcast, but perhaps you should look far and wide as well, rather than just listening to other podcasts.  Howard Stern is perhaps another useful source?</p>
<p>If they had had another season of Seinfeld, would Jerry have to have started (again) dating Elaine?  The dramatic stories in a podcast also need to change and evolve over time, and perhaps I will return to that topic in the future.</p>

            <p><span><span><span>Hoping to spur crowd-sourced AI applications in health care, Stanford’s AIMI center is expanding its free repository of datasets for researchers around the world.</span></span></span></p>
      
  </div>

<div>
  
    
      
      <div>
              
              <div>
  <div>
        
          <div>
        
            <div><p><span><span><span>In a move to democratize research on artificial intelligence and medicine, Stanford’s <a href="https://aimi.stanford.edu/">Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging</a> (AIMI) is dramatically expanding what is already the world’s largest free repository of AI-ready annotated medical imaging datasets.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly pervasive tool for interpreting medical images, from detecting tumors in mammograms and brain scans to analyzing ultrasound videos of a person’s pumping heart.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Many AI-powered devices now rival the accuracy of human doctors. Beyond simply spotting a likely tumor or bone fracture, some systems predict the course of a patient’s illness and make recommendations.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But AI tools have to be trained on expensive datasets of images that have been meticulously annotated by human experts. Because those datasets can cost millions of dollars to acquire or create, much of the research is being funded by big corporations that don’t necessarily share their data with the public.</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Visit the new <a href="https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/">Stanford AIMI shared dataset platform</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span><span><span>“What drives this technology, whether you’re a surgeon or an obstetrician, is data,” says <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren">Matthew Lungren</a>, co-director of AIMI and an assistant professor of radiology at Stanford. “We want to double down on the idea that medical data is a public good, and that it should be open to the talents of researchers anywhere in the world.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Launched two years ago, AIMI has already acquired annotated datasets for more than 1 million images, many of them from the Stanford University Medical Center. Researchers can download those datasets at no cost and use them to train AI models that recommend certain kinds of action. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Now, AIMI has teamed up with Microsoft’s AI for Health program <a href="https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/">to launch a new platform</a> that will be more automated, accessible, and visible. It will be capable of hosting and organizing scores of additional images from institutions around the world. Part of the idea is to create an open and global repository. The platform will also provide a hub for sharing research, making it easier to refine different models and identify differences between population groups. The platform can even offer cloud-based computing power so researchers don’t have to worry about building local resource intensive clinical machine-learning infrastructure. </span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Building a Research Ecosystem</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>The idea is to create an entire ecosystem for AI medical research, and not just for analyzing images. With the right datasets, people will also be able to explore important clinical use cases beyond the pixel data alone, including other related companion multimodal data.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The center already has nine datasets containing more than 1 million images, and Lungren predicts that number will double within the next year. Two new datasets will be released with the new platform. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“This platform will have the largest diversity and volume of AI-ready medical datasets in the world,” he says. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In time, the platform will also offer standardized machine-learning tools and pre-trained models leveraging open-source data and common architectures — AI software in a box, as it were — to spur a wave of crowd-sourced AI research. </span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Democratizing the Tools</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>By offering data at no cost, researchers will be able to explore niche areas, such as medical problems that affect particular communities, that large corporations might well overlook. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>These diverse datasets will also make it easier for researchers to spot hidden biases in the data or in algorithms. Studies have shown that some AI models are more accurate for certain population groups than others, mainly because they were trained on data from patients at one location. Having datasets from many different communities will make it easier for researchers to detect those issues.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“We love that corporations are doing all this work, but we don’t love the fact that the opportunity to share information is asymmetric,” Lungren says. “If they amass data but then lock it down, they will be the only ones who can innovate, which would shut out the important contributions by computer scientists and clinicians around the world. That’s not a position we want to be in.”</span></span></span></p>

      <title>Object Wake-Up: 3-D Object Reconstruction, Animation from a Single Image</title>

      <span>Abstract:</span>  Given a picture of a chair, could we extract the 3-D shape of the chair,
animate its plausible articulations and motions, and render in-situ in its
original image space? The above question prompts us to devise an automated
approach to extract and manipulate articulated objects in single images.
Comparing with previous efforts on object manipulation, our work goes beyond
2-D manipulation and focuses on articulable objects, thus introduces greater
flexibility for possible object deformations. The pipeline of our approach
starts by reconstructing and refining a 3-D mesh representation of the object
of interest from an input image; its control joints are predicted by exploiting
the semantic part segmentation information; the obtained object 3-D mesh is
then rigged \&amp; animated by non-rigid deformation, and rendered to perform
in-situ motions in its original image space. Quantitative evaluations are
carried out on 3-D reconstruction from single images, an established task that
is related to our pipeline, where our results surpass those of the SOTAs by a
noticeable margin. Extensive visual results also demonstrate the applicability
of our approach.

      <p>Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have linked together, or “entangled,” the mechanical motion and electronic properties of a tiny blue crystal, giving it a quantum edge in measuring electric fields with record sensitivity that may enhance understanding of the universe.</p>

<p>The quantum sensor consists of 150 beryllium ions (electrically charged atoms) confined in a magnetic field, so they self-arrange into a flat 2D crystal just 200 millionths of a meter in diameter. Quantum sensors such as this have the potential to detect signals from dark matter — a mysterious substance that might turn out to be, among other theories, subatomic particles that interact with normal matter through a weak electromagnetic field. The presence of dark matter could cause the crystal to wiggle in telltale ways, revealed by collective changes among the crystal’s ions in one of their electronic properties, known as spin. </p>

<p>As described in the Aug. 6 issue of <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6555/673">Science</a>,</em> researchers can measure the vibrational excitation of the crystal — the flat plane moving up and down like the head of a drum — by monitoring changes in the collective spin. Measuring the spin indicates the extent of the vibrational excitation, referred to as displacement.</p>

<p>This sensor can measure external electric fields that have the same vibration frequency as the crystal with more than 10 times the sensitivity of any previously demonstrated atomic sensor. (Technically, the sensor can measure 240 nanovolts per meter in one second.) In the experiments, researchers apply a weak electric field to excite and test the crystal sensor. A dark matter search would look for such a signal.</p>

<p>“Ion crystals could detect certain types of dark matter — examples are axions and hidden photons — that interact with normal matter through a weak electric field,” NIST senior author John Bollinger said. “The dark matter forms a background signal with an oscillation frequency that depends on the mass of the dark matter particle. Experiments searching for this type of dark matter have been ongoing for more than a decade with superconducting circuits. The motion of trapped ions provides sensitivity over a different range of frequencies.”</p>

<p>Bollinger’s group has been working with the ion crystal for more than a decade. What’s new is the use of a specific type of laser light to entangle the collective motion and spins of a large number of ions, plus what the researchers call a “time reversal” strategy to detect the results. </p>

<p>The experiment benefited from a collaboration with NIST theorist Ana Maria Rey, who works at JILA, a joint institute of NIST and the University of Colorado Boulder. The theory work was critical for understanding the limits of the laboratory setup, offered a new model for understanding the experiment that is valid for large numbers of trapped ions, and demonstrated that the quantum advantage comes from entangling the spin and motion, Bollinger said.</p>

<p>Rey noted that entanglement is beneficial in canceling the ions’ intrinsic quantum noise. However, measuring the entangled quantum state without destroying the information shared between spin and motion is difficult.</p>

<p>“To avoid this issue, John is able to reverse the dynamics and disentangle the spin and the motion after the displacement is applied,” Rey said. “This time reversal decouples the spin and the motion, and now the collective spin itself has the displacement information stored on it, and when we measure the spins we can determine the displacement very precisely. This is neat!”</p>

          </figcaption></figure><p>The researchers used microwaves to produce desired values of the spins. Ions can be spin up (often envisioned as an arrow pointing up), spin down or other angles, including both at the same time, a special quantum state. In this experiment the ions all had the same spin — first spin up and then horizontal — so when excited they rotated together in a pattern characteristic of spinning tops. </p>

<p>Crossed laser beams, with a difference in frequency that was nearly the same as the motion, were used to entangle the collective spin with the motion. The crystal was then vibrationally excited. The same lasers and microwaves were used to undo the entanglement. To determine how much the crystal moved, researchers measured the ions’ spin level of fluorescence (spin up scatters light, spin down is dark).</p>

<p>In the future, increasing the number of ions to 100,000 by making 3D crystals is expected to improve the sensing capability thirtyfold. In addition, the stability of the crystal’s excited motion might be improved, which would enhance the time reversal process and the precision of the results.</p>

<p>“If we are able to improve this aspect, this experiment can become a fundamental resource for detecting dark matter,” Rey said. “We know 85% of the matter in the universe is made of dark matter, but to date we do not know what dark matter is made of. This experiment could allow us in the future to unveil this mystery.”</p>
