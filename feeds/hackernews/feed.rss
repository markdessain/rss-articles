      <title>Lead Poisoning and Rome</title>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
    Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.&#34;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>Jeremiah, 6:29-30</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A 1983 article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> by Jerome Nriagu, 
  a geochemist, rekindled a debate that had been dormant for almost two decades. There, and in a book published later that year, he argued 
  that &#34;lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire.&#34; Yet, a review by  Scarborough, a pharmacist and classicist,  
  found the book to be &#34;so full of false evidence, miscitations, 
  typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that 
  the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.&#34; He concluded that, although 
  ancient authorities were aware of lead poisoning, it was not endemic in the 
  Roman empire nor caused its fall. Waldron, a specialist in both occupational 
  medicine and archaeology, also criticized the author for not using primary 
  sources and being uncritical of the translated material that he did use, 
  cautioning that &#34;The decline of the Roman Empire is a phenomenon of great 
  complexity and it is simplistic to ascribe it to a single cause.&#34; More than 
  thirty years later, Scarborough&#39;s comments still rankled, Nriagu retorting in 
  an interview that he &#34;knows nothing, absolutely nothing, about lead 
  poisoning, Absolutely zero.&#34; Such was the contention that the topic evoked.</p>
  <p>Lead (Pb) does not occur in an elemental state but is a by-product of silver mining. Extracted from galena ore (PbS, lead sulfide), 
  which is crushed and smelted, the lead was further refined by the Romans in a furnace made hotter still by blasts of 
  forced air  from a bellows 
  (Pliny, <i>Natural History</i>, XXXIII.159). The oxidized lead (PbO, litharge), 
  which was contained in a porous crucible of crushed bone ash, was absorbed, 
  leaving behind a trace amount of silver in a process called &#34;cupellation&#34; 
  (from the cupel used to collect the metal). The lead itself then was recovered by smelting the litharge again with galena, the lead oxide combining with lead sulfide to form 
  metallic lead and sulfur dioxide (2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO<SPAN size="-1">2</SPAN>).</p>
  <p>The ore was readily abundant and in Britannia so near the 
  surface that restrictions limited the quantity that could be produced 
  (XXXIV.164). Once smelted, the lead (<i>plumbum</i>) was easily malleable and had a 
  low melting point<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>ideal 
  for the production of water pipes, which were fabricated by <i>plumbarii</i> (plumbers) from fitted rolled sheets in a variety of 
  diameters (Pliny, XXXI.58; Vitruvius, <i>On Architecture</i>, VIII.6.1ff; Frontinus, <i>On the 
  Aqueducts of Rome</i>, I.37ff). Together with concrete, sheets of lead also were used to line the channels of Roman aqueducts (cf. Vitruvius, II.6.1). </p>
  <p>But lead also was known to be dangerous and, for that 
  reason, pipes made of clay were 
  preferred<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>as Vitruvius, who wrote during 
  the time of Augustus, explains.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that 
    through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from 
    it white lead [PbCO<SPAN size="-1">3, </SPAN>lead carbonate] is obtained, and this is said to 
    be injurious to the human system. Hence, if what is generated from it is pernicious, there can be no doubt that itself cannot be a 
    wholesome body. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; for in casting lead, the fumes from 
    it fixing on the different members, and daily burning them, destroy the vigour of the blood; water should therefore on no account be 
    conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome. That the flavour of that conveyed in earthen pipes is better, 
    is shewn at our daily meals, for all those whose tables are furnished with silver vessels, nevertheless use those made of earth, from 
    the purity of the flavour being preserved in them&#34; (VIII.6.10-11).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Columella remarks on the advantage of terracotta pipes as well. &#34;Rain-water is after all most suitable to the body&#39;s health, and is 
  regarded as uncommonly good if it is conveyed through earthen pipes into a covered cistern&#34; (<i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, I.5.2). Not only wholesome, rainwater was known to have the least amount of contamination (Celsus,<i> On 
  Medicine</i>, II.18.12)<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>as Hippocrates had 
  observed more than four hundred 
  years earlier. &#34;Rain waters, then, are the lightest, the sweetest, the 
  thinnest, and the clearest&#34; (<i>On Airs, Waters, and Places</i>, VIII). Horace celebrated spring water for the same reason, 
  asking &#34;Is the water purer which in city-streets struggles to burst its leaden 
  pipes than that which dances and purls adown the sloping brook?&#34; (<i>Epistles</i>, 
  X.20-21). </p>
  <p>Slightly acidic, rain dissolves carbon dioxide in the 
  atmosphere to form a weak solution of carbonic acid, which in turn reacts with calcium hydroxide 
  (the slaked lime that, together with volcanic ash and aggregate, comprised 
  Roman concrete) to form calcium carbonate (CaCO<SPAN size="-1">3</SPAN>). 
  Water from the river Anio, which fed two of Rome&#39;s principal aqueducts, the Aqua Anio Vetus and Aqua Anio Novus, 
  was particularly hard and conveyed high levels of dissolved calcium 
  carbonate. Indeed, Frontinus complains in his 
  treatise on the aqueducts of Rome, that &#34;the accumulation of deposit, which 
  sometimes hardens into a crust, contracts the channel of the water&#34; (CXXII.1). 
  At NÓmes, the accretion of calcium carbonate increased 
  approximately one millimeter per year (about four inches every century) and constricted 
  the channel of the Pont du Gard by more than a third of its width. This limestone encrustation (<i>sinter</i>, 
  from the German), which had to be periodically chipped away, suggests that deposits 
  of calcium carbonate in pipes and aqueducts protected against corrosion and 
  insulated against the introduction of lead into the water they conveyed. Too, 
  with no taps to shut off, water flowed continuously and so would not have been in prolonged 
  contact with the metal. And, in any event, most water brought to Rome by its 
  aqueducts was used to supply the public baths. </p>
  <p>Rather than encrusted lead pipes, the probable cause of chronic lead poisoning (plumbism or &#34;saturnism&#34; because its symptoms seemed 
  indicative of the god&#39;s melancholic and sullen character) was the consumption of <i>defrutum</i> and <i>sapa</i>. 
  The elder Cato, Columella, and Pliny all describe how unfermented grape juice (<i>mustum</i>, 
  must) was boiled to concentrate its 
  natural sugars. &#34;A product of art, not of nature,&#34; the must was reduced to one half (<i>defrutum</i>) or even one third its volume (<i>sapa</i>) 
  (Pliny, XIV.80), although the terms are not always consistent.  Columella identifies <i>defrutum</i> 
  as &#34;must of the 
  sweetest possible flavour&#34; that has been boiled down to a third of its volume 
  (XXI.1). Isidore of Seville, writing in the seventh century AD, says that it 
  is <i>sapa</i> that has been reduced by a third and imagines that <i>
  defrutum</i> was so called because it has been cheated or defrauded (<i>defrudare</i>) 
  (<i>Etymologies</i>, XX.3.15). Varro reverses Pliny&#39;s proportions altogether (quoted in Nonius Marcellus, <i>De 
  Conpendiosa Doctrina, </i>XVIII.551M).</p>
  <p>The thickened syrup was used to sweeten and preserve wine and fruit that otherwise was sour or would spoil. Cato recommends 
  that quinces and pears be preserved in boiled must (<i>On Agriculture</i>, VII.3) as does Varro (<i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, I.59.3). Columella insists that <i>defrutum</i> 
  always be boiled with quinces or some other flavoring (XII.20.2). Apicius offers directions for preserving 
  quinces in <i>defrutum</i> and honey (<i>De Re Coquinaria, </i>I.21) and added 
  the rich syrup to almost a fifth of his sauces to enhance the color and flavor 
  of almost every dish. (That color was added indicates that red, rather 
  than white, wine was used in the reduction.)</p>
  <p><i>Defrutum</i> and <i>sapa</i> were dangerous not in themselves but in 
  their preparation. In <i>De Agricultura</i>, the earliest example of Latin prose (c.160 BC), Cato gives directions for reducing must in &#34;a copper or lead 
  vessel&#34; over a slow fire, &#34;stirring constantly to prevent scorching; continue the boiling, until you have boiled off a half&#34; (CVII). 
  Writing in the first century AD, Columella elaborates on the process.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Some people put the must in leaden vessels and by boiling reduce it by a quarter, others by a third. There is no doubt that anyone 
    who boiled it down to one-half would be likely to make a better thick form of must and therefore more profitable for use....But, before 
    the must is poured into the boiling-vessels, it will be well that those which are made of lead should be coated inside with good oil and 
    be well-rubbed, and that then the must should be put in....The vessels themselves in which the thickened and boiled-down must is boiled 
    should be of lead rather than of brass; for, in the boiling, brazen vessels throw off copper rust, and spoil the flavour 
    of the preservative&#34; (XII.19.1, 19.6, 20.1).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Pliny, too, recommends that the must be prepared in lead vessels.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Also boiled-down must and must of new wine should be boiled when there 
    is no moon, which means at the conjunction of that planet, and not on any 
    other day; and moreover leaden and not copper jars should be used, and some 
    walnuts should be thrown into the liquor, for those are said to absorb the 
    smoke&#34; (XIV.136).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It would seem therefore that must was boiled in lead cauldrons. But 
  Scarborough is reluctant to weaken his case, insisting that &#34;one needs to read 
  these texts carefully which mention a &#39;preference&#39; for lead over bronze to 
  realize that the Romans most often used bronze cauldrons (copper and tin in 
  alloy), not those of lead&#34; and that the short boiling time would not have 
  contaminated the juice in any event. But copper and bronze are suspect as 
  well. Not only, says Pliny, was the best bronze alloyed with 10% lead and 
  tin (XXXIV.95) but &#34;When copper 
  vessels are coated with <i>stagnum</i> [a lead alloy], the contents have a 
  more agreeable taste and the formation of destructive verdigris is prevented&#34; 
  (XXXIV.160).</p>
  <p>The verdigris about which Pliny complains is  copper acetate, a bitter salt 
   
  first  described by Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle, in <i>De Re Metallica</i> 
  (IX), that is formed when acetic acid (the component that gives vinegar its sour taste 
  and pungent smell) reacts with copper oxide. Commercially, it was 
  manufactured by exposing copper plates to strong vinegar or the<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> 
  soured </SPAN>grape skins and lees of wine dregs (Dioscorides, <i>Materia 
  Medica</i>, V.91). Acetic acid also reacts with lead oxide (litharge) to 
  create another metallic salt: lead acetate or sugar of lead. Although as sweet 
  as sugar (which was unknown to the Romans), it actually added very little to the sweetness 
  of the <i>defrutum</i>, which derived from the concentrated 
  glucose and fructose of the grapes themselves. What it did import was an onerous burden of 
  lead. </p>
  <p>Eisinger found that must reduced in a lead-lined pot to one-third its volume 
  contained approximately one gram of lead per liter. If, as Columella recommends (XII.20.3), one <i>sextarius</i> of <i>defrutum</i> 
  was mixed with one <i>amphora</i> of wine, the resulting proportion would be one part 
  in forty-eight or almost 21 milligrams of lead per liter (mg/L)<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>a 
  burden of lead so high as to be scarcely credible. Just three deciliters<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>the equivalent of two 
  five-ounce glasses<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>would contain almost 2100 
  micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) and certainly induce symptoms of lead 
  poisoning<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, </SPAN>even more readily if one were 
  to follow 
  Cato&#39;s recommendation of one part in thirty (XXIV). That having been said, smaller vessels have a larger surface area relative to their volume. The four-liter pot used by Patterson et al. to 
  produce <i>sapa</i> of the same concentration (1000 ppm) presumably would leach out more of the metal than the huge cauldron mentioned by Columella (XII.20.3), 
  in which ninety <i>amphorae</i> (each holding about 26 liters) of must was reduced. 
  This cauldron &#34;should be coated inside with good oil and be well rubbed&#34; 
  (XII.19.6); Cato speaks of his own wine vats being treated with pitch (II.3), 
  and one wonders if Patterson, following a recipe provided by Gilfillan, did 
  the same.</p>
  <p>Such levels of lead have significant physiological consequences. A single 
  teaspoon of Columellan wine would have approximately 103 µg/dL of lead. As reported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is 
  brain and kidney damage in adults with blood lead levels of 100 µg/dL; gastrointestinal symptoms such as colic with levels of 
  approximately 60 µg/dL; anemia with levels of 50 to 80 µg/dL; neurological symptoms with levels of 40 to 60 µg/dL; depressed sperm count 
  with levels of 40 to 50 µg/dL; and increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and impaired mental development with maternal 
  blood lead levels of 10 to 15 µg/dL. The physiological insult to children is even greater.  Since 2012, 
  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended intervention in 
  children five years or younger when the level of lead in the blood is above 5 µg/dL 
  and even may lower that figure to 3.5 µg/dL. </p>
  <p>Nriagu estimates the aristocracy of Rome to have consumed two liters of 
  wine a day<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> or </SPAN>almost three bottles (which 
  would seem to make alcoholism more suspect than lead poisoning<SPAN face="Times New Roman">)
  </SPAN>and the resulting lead intake to have averaged 180 µg daily. He further 
  estimates the total amount of lead absorbed from all sources to be 250 µg per 
  day and lead concentration in the blood to be 50 µg/dL<SPAN face="Times New Roman">,
  </SPAN>at least for the gluttonous and bibulous (as he phrases it) and those 
  with an appetite for adulterated wines and sweetened dainties<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>who 
  he presumes most Roman emperors to have been. </p>
  <p>In fact, there is no way to quantify what Roman aristocrats actually did 
  eat or drink, nor to determine the varying relationship between ingested lead 
  and blood lead levels. If Nriagu&#39;s assumptions are correct, his contention 
  that &#34;a large number of Roman aristocrats ingested more than enough lead with 
  their foods and drinks each day to put them at risk for lead poisoning&#34; 
  would be as 
  well. But often, to take one example, they are not.</p>
  <p>During the vintage, says Cato, inferior grapes were set aside, to be saved 
  &#34;for the sharp wine for the hands to drink, when the time comes&#34; (XXIII.2), 
  which were the three months following the vintage (LVII). Issued instead of 
  wine in winter, this &#34;after-wine&#34; or <i>lora</i> was made from 
  grape skins and pulp mixed with water and pressed a second time, its 
  sharp bitterness so called because it &#34;tastes of the knife&#34; (Varro, I.54.3; 
  cf. Pliny, XIV.86, who felt that what was extracted from lees and grape skins 
  soaked in water &#34;cannot rightly be styled wines&#34; ). 
  In calculating the ration of wine for his workers (<i>familiae</i>, as they 
  were part of the family household), Cato provides the only contemporary figures for 
  wine consumption which, for the remaining three quarters of the year, varied 
  seasonally from one, two, or three <i>heminae</i> 
  per day. An additional three-and-a-half <i>congii</i> (another forty-two <i>heminae</i>) were 
  issued to celebrate the <i>Saturnalia</i> and <i>
  Compitalia</i>. In total, seven <i>amphora</i>e of wine were allotted during 
  these nine months (LVII), almost two-and-a-half <i>heminae</i> or about 663 ml. daily. 
  For the other three months of the year, an indeterminate amount of watery <i>
  lora</i> was drunk. In considering the same passage, Nriagu is not so nuanced 
  and says 
  simply that Cato recommends 
  &#34;about 750 ml of the afterwine&#34; per day.</p>
  <p>It should be remembered, too, that  Romans diluted their wine. Unmixed wine (<i>merum</i>) 
  was considered the drink of provincials, barbarians<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, 
  and drunkards</SPAN>. Mixed, the proportion of water and wine varied, 
  sometimes 
  dictated by a <i>magister bibendi </i>chosen by lot<i> </i>at a <i>comissatio</i> 
  (Horace, <i>Odes</i>, I.4.18, II.7.25) or determined by the guests 
  themselves, drinking from cups large or small &#34;not bound by crazy laws&#34; 
  (Horace, <i>Satires</i>, II.6.69). Even then, a <i>magistra</i> was in 
  attendance: the restraint of <i>culpa</i> itself and not being thought culpable of  drinking to excess (<i>Satires</i>, II.2.123). </p>
  <p>Athenaeus, a Greek rhetorician who flourished in the reigns of Marcus 
  Aurelius and Commodus, writes of the matter in detail. In the <i>
  Deipnosophistae</i>, when the learned conversation of the symposiasts eventually 
  turns to the mixing of wine, a proverb was recalled: &#34;Drink either five 
  or three or at least not four&#34; (X.80). It was a saying that earlier had piqued 
  the interest of Plutarch, who explains that one should drink either five or 
  three portions of wine to water but not four<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>five 
  being three cups of water mixed with two of wine and three, two cups mixed 
  with one. Four, three cups of water to one of wine, &#34;a mixture sober and weak 
  enough&#34;  was not recommended. Rather, the most harmonious of proportion was 
  two to three, &#34;stilling and appeasing all proud and disordered passions within 
  the heart, and inducing instead of them a peaceable calm and tranquility&#34; (<i>Table 
  Talk</i>, III.9).</p>
  <p>There were other ratios of course. Horace cautions that 
  those who revere the three Graces should mix no more than one part of wine 
  with three of water<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>but for the poet who celebrates the nine Muses, the ratio<i> </i>
  should be inverted. (<i>Odes</i>, III.19). And Martial teases a companion who 
  repeatedly drank water with his wine and the  wine only sparingly, joking 
  that he must be staying sober so to enjoy an amorous evening (<i>Epigrams</i>, 
  I.106). A pretentious equestrian such as Sextilianus, on the other hand, is 
  lampooned for drinking his wine unmixed, which made the warm water that would 
  have heated it unnecessary (I.11).  Martial chides that, if he is to drink so 
  much at public festivals (more than his allotment of tokens), at least it should not be Opimius but a cheaper wine (I.26). A 
  celebrated vintage of 121 BC, Opimius was by then almost two hundred years 
  old<SPAN face="Times New Roman">óand, ironically, </SPAN>intolerably bitter and impossible to drink without being mixed with water 
  (Pliny, XIV.55). Of the two liters 
  of wine that Nriagu estimates aristocrats to have been drunk every day, were 
  they mixed with two parts of water (Plutarch&#39;s favored portion), only two-thirds of a liter (four-and-a-half glasses)  would have been 
  undiluted wine.</p>
  <p>Almost twenty years earlier, Gilfillan had insisted (his &#34;novel theory&#34; restating 
  a notion first proposed in German by Kobert in 1909) that &#34;lead poisoning is 
  to be reckoned the major influence in the ruin of the Roman culture, 
  progressiveness, and genius,&#34; threatening the cognition and fertility of the 
  nobility. But that proposition, too, was debunked by Needleman and Needleman, 
  who demonstrated that the decline of the Roman 
  aristocracy could as easily be explained by the simple desire not to marry or to 
  rear few or no children.¬†In 18 BC and AD 9, Augustus had sought to 
  promote marriage and encourage procreation. &#34;And yet, marriages and the rearing of children did not become more frequent, so powerful were the 
  attractions of a childless state&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, III.25). In a review of the life span of emperors and 
  aristocrats, Scheidel dismisses any impact of lead ingestion on fertility. 
  &#34;Nor is there any need to suspect that the incidence of marital sterility in 
  the Roman ruling class might have been much higher than in other groups, 
  times, and places.&#34; Drasch found that the average lead burden in Rome was not significantly 
  higher than in the legionary camp and provincial capital at Augsburg in 
  Bavaria. In 
  Britain, the skeletal lead burden was even higher than in Rome. Still, Nriagu insists that &#34;one 
  of the principle, probable causes of the internal weaknesses&#34; of the Roman empire was lead poisoning of the aristocracy.</p>
  <p>Certainly,  Romans knew lead to be dangerous, even if they did not associate it with their lead cooking vessels 
  or the preparation of <i>sapa</i>. Pliny speaks of the 
  &#34;noxious and deadly vapour&#34; (sulfur dioxide) of the lead furnace (XXXIV.167; there 
  was, in fact, a four-fold increase in atmospheric Pb 
  pollution during the Greco-Roman period); red lead (<i>minium</i>) 
  (XXXIII.124) and white lead (ceruse) (XXXIV.176) as poisonous, 
  even though both were used as a medicine and cosmetic; and the power of <i>sapa</i> (and onion) to induce an abortion (XXIII.30). 
  Dioscorides cautions against taking white lead internally, as it is deadly (V.103). Soranus recommends that the 
  mouth of the uterus be smeared with white lead to prevent conception (<i>Gynecology</i>, 
  I.19.61). Galen (<i>On Antidotes</i>, XIV.144) and Celsus (V.27.12b) both 
  provide an antidote for poisoning by white lead, and Vitruvius remarks on the 
  pernicious effects of water found near lead mines and its effect on the body 
  (VIII.3.5, 6.11).</p>
  <p>The earliest description of acute lead poisoning (mid-second century BC) is given in the <i>Alexipharmaca</i> of Nicander, who speaks of 
  &#34;gleaming, deadly white lead whose fresh colour is like milk which foams all over&#34; (II.74ff). The poet describes a frothing mouth, 
  asperity of the tongue, and dry throat, together with dry retching, chills, delusions, and overwhelming fatigue. But if lead poisoning had 
  been endemic, it presumably would have been remarked upon at the time. And yet there is no mention of the fact until early in the seventh 
  century AD, when Paul of Aegina, a Byzantine physician, described chronic lead 
  poisoning (although he does not associate its symptoms with the disease). &#34;I am of the opinion that the colic affection which now 
  prevails is occasioned by such humours; the disease having taken its rise in the country of Italy, but raging also in many other regions 
  of the Roman empire, like a pestilential contagion, which in many cases terminates in epilepsy, but in others in paralysis of the 
  extremities, while the sensibility of them is preserved, and sometimes both these afflictions attacking together&#34; (III.64).</p>
  <p><i>Defrutum</i> was only one of several remedies to sweeten or preserve potentially sour wine<SPAN face="Times New Roman">. 
  P</SPAN>itch, resin, ash, and sea water also were added (Pliny, XIV.124ff)<SPAN face="Times New Roman">, 
  as well as marble dust (Cato, XXIII.3); </SPAN> and aromatic spices such as 
  myrrh, cinnamon, balsam, and saffron added to the <i>defrutum</i> (Columella, XII.20.5). Such was the use 
  of additives that Martial accuses a wine merchant of Marseilles of shipping poisonous and overpriced wines to his 
  friends and, indeed, being reluctant to visit Rome for fear of having to drink them himself (X.36). 
  And Pliny complains 
  that &#34;genuine, unadulterated wine is not to be had now, not even by the nobility&#34; (XXIII.1), ruefully remarking &#34;So many poisons are 
  employed to force wine to suit our tasteóand we are surprised that it is not wholesome!&#34; (XIV.130). Indeed, &#34;So low has our commercial 
  honesty sank that only the names of vintages are sold, the wines being adulterated as soon as they are poured into the vats. Accordingly, 
  strange though it may seem, the more common the wine is today, the freer it is 
  from impurities&#34; (XXIII.34). </p>
  <p>Columella regards &#34;as the best wine any kind which can keep without any preservative, nor should anything at all be mixed with 
  it by which its natural savour would be obscured; for that wine is most excellent which has given pleasure by its own natural quality&#34; 
  (XII.19.2). Further, &#34;care must be taken that the flavour of the preservative is not noticeable, for that drives away the purchaser&#34; 
  (XII.20.7). Writing several decades later in the first century AD, Dioscorides says much the same thing. &#34;Generally, all unmixed and simple wine 
  (hard by nature) is warming, easily digested and good for the stomach. It encourages the appetite, is nourishing, induces sleep, and 
  causes a good colour&#34; (V.11). Those with <i>sapa</i>, however, &#34;fill the head causing drunkenness.&#34; One should 
  drink moderately and (because alcohol is a diuretic and dehydrates the body) drink water both before and afterwards, &#34;for it brings some 
  help in avoiding illness owing to drunkenness.&#34; </p>
  <p>The best tasting wine, therefore, was unadulterated and presumably the wine 
  drunk by the nobility, who supposedly 
  were most at risk for lead poisoning. More than wine or water transported through lead pipes, 
  it was the dainties and elaborate sauces prepared 
  with <i>defrutum</i> by gourmands such as <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/apicius.html">
  <SPAN color="#450C02">Apicius</SPAN></a> that 
  were the primary source of ingested lead 
  by the Roman aristocracy.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A teacher of Epictetus and &#34;a man devoted to the study of philosophy and in 
  particular to the Stoic doctrine&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Histories, </i>III.81), 
  Musonius Rufus was compared by Origen to Socrates himself as a model of the 
  excellent life (<i>Against Celsus</i>, III.66). He may have nearly died while 
  imprisoned by Nero (Philostratus, <i>Life of Apollonius</i>, IV.35), who later 
  exiled Musonius to a desolate island in the Cyclades because of his 
  prominence and influence in &#34;the precepts of philosophy&#34; (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, 
  XV.71). When Vespasian expelled all the other philosophers from the city in 
  about AD 71 (Dio, <i>Roman History</i>, LXV.13), Musonius alone was exempted, 
  only later to be banished to Syria, where he was esteemed by Pliny the 
  Younger, who was serving there (<i>Letters</i>, XXXI). Recalled to Rome by 
  Titus in AD 79 (Jerome, <i>Chronica</i>, 214th Olympiad), he died  
  sometime before AD 102.</p>
  <p>Musonius is cited by Nriagu in a quotation from <i>Apician Morsels; or, Tales of 
  the Table, Kitchen, and Larder</i>, a farrago of gastronomical curiosities on
  <span>a new and improved code of <i>eatics</i>; 
  select epicurean precepts; nutritive maxims, reflections, anecdotes, &amp;c.</span>&#34; 
  (to partially quote the subtitle) that was published in 1829 under the 
  pseudonym of Dick Humelbergius Secundus (a whimsical allusion to a 
  sixteenth-century editor of Apicius).</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>&#34;That masters are less strong, less healthy, less able to endure labour 
  than servants; countrymen more strong than those who are bred in the city, 
  those that feed meanly than those who feed daintily; and that, generally, the 
  latter live longer than the former. Nor are are there any other persons more 
  troubled with gouts, dropsies, colics, and the like, than those who, 
  condemning simple diet, live upon prepared dainties&#34; (p. 39).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Although the passage is not referenced, it is from Musonius&#39; lecture &#34;On 
  Food&#34; (XVIIIB), summarized in Greek by one of his students. In making his 
  argument, Nriagu takes the last sentence at face value. But it is missing in 
  more authoritative translations.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;Quite the contrary, people who eat the cheapest food are the strongest. 
    Indeed you may notice that slaves are usually stronger than their masters, 
    country men than city men, the poor than the rich, better able to do hard 
    work, less fatigued by their labor, less frequently ill, enduring more 
    cheerfully cold, heat, lack of sleep, and every such hardship.&#34; (trans. 
    Lutz, 1947)</p>
    <p>&#34;Indeed, those who eat the least expensive foods are the strongest. Thus, 
    slaves are generally stronger than their masters, country folk are stronger 
    than city folk, and the poor are stronger than the rich. Furthermore, those 
    who eat inexpensive food can work harder, are less fatigued by working, and 
    are sick less often those those who eat expensive food. Also, they are 
    better able to tolerate cold, heat, lack of sleep, and so forth.&#34; (trans. 
    King, 2010)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nriagu also understands Musonius to be &#34;an eyewitness,&#34;  which 
  in his book is emended to read &#34;an actual eyewitness account,&#34; and &#34;masters&#34; 
  to be the &#34;aristocrats...of his time&#34;<SPAN face="Times New Roman">óassumptions</SPAN> 
  that simply are not supported by the actual quotation. They are confounded even more 
  by someone such as Cato, a staunch defender of republican virtue and rustic 
  austerity who would not have considered himself an aristocrat. As <i>pater familias</i>, 
  he was absolute master of 
  his household family (the word, in fact, is translated as &#34;master&#34; in <i>On 
  Agriculture</i>, II.1), but then, having worked next to his servants, he &#34;sat down 
  with them to eat of the same bread and drink of the same wine&#34; (Plutarch, <i>
  Life of Cato the Elder</i>, III.2). </p>

  <p>One reads that Hippocrates (died c. 370 BC) was the 
  first to describe lead colic in a metal worker. Although a primary source 
  almost never is provided, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica 
  Online</i> does say, in its entry on <i>Occupational Disease: The Preindustrial 
  Era,</i> that &#34;The first recorded observation of an 
  occupational disease may be a case of severe lead colic suffered by a worker who extracted metals. It is described in the third book of <i>
  Epidemics</i>, attributed to Hippocrates.&#34; </p>
  <p>In fact, the reference is from <i>Epidemics</i> IV.25, where there is brief 
  mention of a man &#34;from the mines&#34; who, among his other symptoms, was pale. 
  And, indeed, miners often were described as <i>pallidus</i>. Vitruvius remarks 
  on the pallid color of lead workers. Lucan (<i>Pharsalia</i>, IV.298), Silius 
  Italicus (<i>Punica</i>, I.233), and Statius (<i>Silvae</i>, IV.7.15) all 
  comment, however, on the pallor of gold miners, especially those from Asturias in 
  northern Spain, the mining operations which Pliny may have witnessed for himself 
  (XXXIII.66ff). But it is facile to assume that, because Romans reported symptoms concomitant with 
  lead poisoning, they necessarily were caused by leadóor, to phrase it another way, that if lead poisoning 
  has certain symptoms, the same 
  symptoms can be attributed to it<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>as 
  Waldron comments in his review of Nriagu. While Hippocrates may have known about lead poisoning, Waldron cautions that he &#34;did not describe it in 
  any of the books which have come down to us.&#34;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>An etymological note: &#34;mustard&#34; derives from must, as the juice was used to 
  form a paste of ground mustard seeds. And <i>merum</i> (from <i>merus</i>, 
  &#34;undiluted&#34;) is the root of the archaic &#34;mere,&#34; meaning &#34;pure&#34; 
  (as in Shakespeare&#39;s &#34;mere madness&#34; or C. S. Lewis&#39; <i>Mere Christianity</i>), as opposed to its 
  modern meaning of &#34;nothing more than&#34; (as in a &#34;mere child&#34;).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A note on citations may be in 
  order, as well, in regard to the numerous references to Pliny, whose <i>Natural History</i> 
  is most readily available in a nineteenth-century translation by Bostcock. 
  There &#34;black lead&#34; is referenced as 
  Book XXXIV, Chapter 49. In the original Latin, the chapter is further divided 
  into sections, XXXIV.xlix.164 and XXXIV.xlix.165. Other chapters in the book 
  (xix, for example) comprise more than forty sections. To direct the reader 
  more readily to a specific passage, only the book and section usually are 
  cited<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> in the literatureóbut not </SPAN>the chapter<SPAN face="Times New Roman"> 
  (which is redundant). This </SPAN>convention has been followed here. But it means that those who want to read more will be 
  obliged to go to the Latin (online at LacusCurtius), discover the chapter number 
  of the section, and then return to Bostcock.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&#34;But the Goths kept pressing vigorously upon them, shooting many missiles at the battlements, and they were already about to set 
    their ladders against the wall, having practically surrounded those who were fighting from the tomb; for whenever the Goths advanced 
    they always got in the rear of the Romans on both flanks; and for a short time consternation fell upon the Romans, who knew not what 
    means of defence they should employ to save themselves, but afterwards by common agreement they broke in pieces the most of the statues, 
    which were very large, and taking up great numbers of stones thus secured, threw them with both hands down upon the heads of the enemy, 
    who gave way before this shower of missiles.&#34;</p>
    <p>Procopius, <i>The Gothic War (V.22)</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sometime after 1624, when Urban VIII began to fortify Castel Sant&#39;Angelo 
  (Hadrian&#39;s Tomb), stripping the ancient bronze trusses from the portico of the 
  Pantheon to provide metal for the forging of cannons, the Barberini Faun 
  (pictured above) was discovered 
  in the defensive ditch at the foot of the castle. It is pleasing to think that it may have been one of the statues 
  thrown from the wall during the siege of Rome by the Goths in AD 537. Or, 
  since it once was used as a fountain, it may have adorned a garden there. Although 
  called a faun, the ivy wreath garlanding the head (as well as the horse tail at 
  the base of the spine) identify the drunken figure as a 
  satyr and companion 
  of Dionysus. Here, the exhausted reveler has collapsed in fitful repose on a rock over 
  which a leopard skin, another attribute of the god, has been thrown. By 1627, 
  the statue was installed in the Palazzo Barberini, named for the cardinal who owned 
  it, the nephew of Urban VIII<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>who issued a 
  papal bull declaring that it was to remain an inalienable possession of 
  the Barberini family. </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, in 1799 the statue was sold for 4,000 <i>scudi</i> to Vincenzo 
  Pacetti, a sculptor and art dealer<i>. </i>In anticipation of reselling his 
  acquisition, the missing right leg, which earlier had been 
  constructed in plaster, was restored in marble<SPAN face="Times New Roman">ó</SPAN>now 
  splayed provocatively away from the body. (The figure had assumed its seated 
  posture in 1679, when the leg was placed in a more upright position.) But ownership was contested and 
  the statue again was appropriated 
  by the family, who in 1814 sold it to Ludwig I of Bavaria for twice what 
  the unrecompensed Pacettti had paid. Cheated of his possession, he contrived to 
  forestall  export from Rome, where the statue languished for six more years 
  until, after much litigation and 
  political machinations, it finally was transported to Munich and installed in the Glyptothek, 
  then being constructed to house the collection of the king, who had a room 
  designed specifically for his prize. The Faun, a masterpiece of Hellenistic 
  art dating to about 220 BC, was placed there in 1827 to await the completion 
  of the museum three years later, when it was opened to the public.</p>

This model is only a <em>partial</em> Batman model. It doesn‚Äôt perform that well on the Val Kilmer or George Clooney Batmen, but it is still functional with a specific use case. We thus won‚Äôt call it a Batman model, but instead a Batman <strong>micro-model</strong>.</p><p id="a77f"><strong>Origins</strong></p><p id="d04c">We started using micro-models in the early days of Cord when our focus was purely on video data. We stumbled upon the idea when trying out different modelling frameworks to automate the classification of gastroenterology videos (you can find more about that <a rel="noopener" href="https://eric-landau.medium.com/pain-relief-for-doctors-labelling-data-72f3e5e31c92">here</a>). Our initial strategy was to try a ‚Äúclassical‚Äù data science approach of sampling frames from a wide distribution of videos, training a model, and then testing on out-of-sample images of a different set of videos. We would then use these models and measure our annotation efficiency improvement compared to human labelling. We realized in experiments, however, that a classification model trained on a small set of intelligently selected frames from <em>only one</em> video already produced strong results. We also noticed that as we turned the number of epochs up, our annotation efficiencies got higher.</p><p id="ce36">This was contrary to what we knew about good data science; we were grossly overfitting a model to this video. But it worked, especially if we broke it up such that each video had its own model. We called them micro-models. While this was for video frame classification, we have since extended the practice to include tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation.</p><p id="821f"><strong>What are micro-models exactly?</strong></p><p id="f0ed">Most succinctly, <strong>micro-models are annotation specific models that are overtrained to a particular task or particular piece of data</strong>. They are <em>purposefully</em> overfit models such that they don‚Äôt perform well on general problems, but are very effective in automating one aspect of your data annotation. They are thus designed to only be good at one thing. To use them in practice, we ensemble many together to automate a comprehensive annotation process.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div></figure><p id="6b8c">The distinction between a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù model and a micro-model is not in their architecture or parameters, but in their domain of application, the counter-intuitive data science practices that are used to produce them, and their eventual end uses.</p><p id="04ac"><strong>1-dimensional labelling</strong></p><p id="9bd2">To cover <em>how</em> micro-models work, we will take a highly simplified toy model that can give a clearer insight into the underpinnings beneath them. Machine learning at its core is curve-fitting, just in a very high dimensional space with many parameters. It is thus instructive to distill the essence of building a model to one of the simplest possible cases, one-dimensional labelling. <strong>The following is <em>slightly</em> more technical, feel free to skip ahead.</strong></p><p id="8760">Imagine you are an AI company with the following problem:</p><ul><li id="9424"><em>You need to build a model that fits the hypothetical curve below</em></li><li id="e1d2"><em>You don‚Äôt have the x-y coordinates of the curve and can‚Äôt actually see the curve as a whole, you can only manually sample values of x and for each one you have to look up the corresponding y value associated with it (the ‚Äúlabel‚Äù for x).</em></li><li id="6d17"><em>Due to this ‚Äúlabelling‚Äù operation, each sample comes with a cost</em></li></ul><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="920b">You want to fit the whole curve with one model, but it is too expensive to densely sample points to do so. What strategies can you use here?</p><p id="a425">One strategy is fitting a high degree polynomial to some initial set of sampled points across the domain of the curve, re-sampling at random , evaluating the error, and updating the polynomial as necessary. The issue is that you will have to re-fit the whole curve each time new sample points are checked. Every point will affect every other. Your model will also have to be quite complex to handle all the different variations in the curve.</p><p id="8ea9">Another strategy, which resolves these problems, is to sample in a local region, fit a model that approximates just that region, and then stitch together many of these local regions over the entire domain. We can try to fit a model to just this curved piece below for instance:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="1b78">This is <em>spline interpolation</em>, a common technique for curve-fitting. Each spline is purposefully ‚Äúoverfit‚Äù to a local region. It will not extrapolate well beyond its domain, but it doesn‚Äôt have to. This is the conceptual basis for micro-models, manifested in a low dimensional space. These individual spline units are analogous to ‚Äúmicro-models‚Äù that we are using to automate our x-value labelling.</p><p id="6545">The more general case follows similar core logic with some additional subtleties(like utilizing transfer learning and optimizing sampling strategies). To automate a full computer vision annotation process, we also ‚Äústitch‚Äù micro-models together like an assembly line. Note, ensembling weak models together to achieve better inference results is an idea that has been around for a long time. This is slightly different. We are not averaging micro-models together for a single prediction, we let each one handle predictions on their own. Micro-models are also not just ‚Äúweak learners.‚Äù They just have limited coverage over a data distribution and exhibit <strong>very low bias</strong> over that coverage.</p><p id="9893">We are leveraging the fact that during an annotation process, we have access to some form of human supervision to ‚Äúpoint‚Äù the models to the correct domain. This guidance over the domain of the micro-model allows us to get away with using very few human labels to start automating a process.</p><p id="ff84"><strong>Batman Efficiency</strong></p><p id="5b8b">Models can be defined based on <em>form </em>(a quantifiable representation approximating some phenomena in the world) or on <em>function </em>(a tool that helps you do stuff). My view leans toward the latter. As the common quote goes:</p><blockquote><p id="92ee">All models are wrong, but some are useful.</p></blockquote><p id="73a2">Micro-models are no different. Their justification flows from using them in applications along a variety of domains.</p><p id="fe28">To consider the practical considerations of micro-models with regards to annotation, let‚Äôs look at our Batman example. Taking fifteen hundred frames from the scene we trained our model on, we see that Batman is present in about half of them. Our micro-model in turn picks up about 70% of these instances. We thus get around <strong>five hundred</strong> Batman labels from only <strong>five</strong> manual annotations.</p><p id="75de">There are of course issues of correction. We have false positives for instance. Consider the inference result of one of the ‚Äúfaux‚Äù Batmen from the scene that our model picks up on.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>I‚Äôm (not) Batman</figcaption></figure><p id="8656">We also have bounding boxes that are not as tight as they could be. This is all, however, with just the first pass of our micro-model. Like normal models, micro-models will go through a few rounds of iteration. For this, active learning is the best solution.</p><p id="0ed3">We only started with five labels, but now with some minimal correction and smart sampling, we have more than five hundred labels to work with to train the next generation of our micro-model. We then use this more powerful version to improve on our original inference results and produce higher quality labels. After another loop of this process, when accounting for number of human actions, including manual corrections, our Batman label efficiency with our micro-model gets to over 95%.</p><p id="42af"><strong>Added Benefits</strong></p><p id="7cd5">There are some additional points to consider in evaluating micro-models:</p><ol><li id="1efc"><strong>Time to get started</strong>: You can start using micro-models in inference within five minutes of a new project due to requiring so few labels to train.</li><li id="aedd"><strong>Iteration time</strong>: A corollary to the speed of getting started is the short iteration cycle. You can get into active learning loops that are minutes long rather than hours or days.</li><li id="5911"><strong>Prototyping: </strong>Short iteration cycles facilitate rapid model experimentation. We have seen micro-models serve as very useful prototypes for the future production models people are building. They are quick checks if ideas are minimally feasible for an ML project.</li></ol><p id="8020"><strong>Data-oriented Programming</strong></p><p id="c249">While we have found success in using micro-models for data annotation, we think there is also a realm of possibility beyond just data pipeline applications. As mentioned before, AI is curve fitting. But even more fundamentally, it is getting a computer to do something you want it to do, which is simply programming. It is just a form of programming that is statistically rather than logically driven.</p><p id="f7f6">‚ÄúNormal‚Äù programming works by establishing deterministic contingencies for the transformation of inputs to outputs via logical operations. Machine learning thrives in high complexity domains where the difficulty in logically capturing these contingencies is supplanted by learning from examples. This <em>statistical</em> programming paradigm is still in its infancy and hasn‚Äôt developed the conceptual frameworks around it for robust practical use yet.</p><p id="0d9c">For example, factorization of problems into smaller components is one of the key elements to most problem solving frameworks. The object oriented programming paradigm was an organziational shift in this direction that accelerated the development of software engineering and is still in practice today. We are still in the early days of AI, and perhaps instantiating a <strong><em>data-oriented programming</em> </strong>paradigm is necessary for similar rapid progression.</p><p id="c30b">In this context, micro-models might have a natural analogue in the object paradigm. One lump in a complex data distribution is an ‚Äúobject equivalent‚Äù with the micro-model being an instantiation of that object. While these ideas are still early, they coincide well with the new emphasis on <em>data-centric AI</em>. Developing the tools to orchestrate these ‚Äúdata objects‚Äù is the burden for the next generation of AI infrastructure. We are only getting started, and still have a long way to go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Force Click for Layer Selection</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="force-click">Force Click</h2>

<p>Apple‚Äôs recent trackpads have a feature where you can press harder on them and get a ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù click. This is called <em>Force click</em>.<sup id="fnref:click" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:click" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Apple has given it a bunch of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204352">uses in their own apps</a>, but I would guess you only ever use it accidentally. The only way I‚Äôve ever used Force click intentionally is to look up a word. I remember to do this about, uhh, twice a year.</p>

<video width="572" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
  <source src="/data/force-click/force-click-word.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
<p>Demo of Force click on text.</p>

<p>But, rejoice, for I have cooked up a use for Force click.</p>

<h2 id="layers">Layers</h2>

<p>Visual software, like Photoshop or Sketch, use the concept of <em>layers</em>. Layers separate your overall design into independent visual slices that are placed on top of each other. I‚Äôll use Sketch as an example because it‚Äôs the visual software I use right now.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sketch: layers (left) and corresponding design (right).</p>

<p>You often need to select a layer that is below some other layer.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there are a few ways of doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Try to find an area in the design with only your desired layer.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Annoying because: you need to switch cognitive modes from <em>‚ÄúI want to select X‚Äù</em> to <em>‚Äúlet me find an area where only X occurs.‚Äù</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Find your layer in the list.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Annoying because: you need to switch cognitive modes from <em>‚ÄúI want to select X‚Äù</em> to <em>‚Äúlet me scan through the non-visual list of (potentially dozens or hundreds of) layers with bad names like ‚ÄòPolygon Copy 3‚Äô and find the one corresponding to X.‚Äù</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Right click and use the ‚ÄúSelect Layer‚Äù menu.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Annoying because: (a) the menu shows your layer names without highlighting them as you browse, so it‚Äôs utterly useless if your layers are named things like ‚ÄòPolygon Copy 3,‚Äô (b) if you‚Äôre using <span>shift</span> to select multiple layers, right clicking destroys the selection you‚Äôre accumulating.<sup id="fnref:fix" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fix" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="proposal-force-click-for-layer-selection">Proposal: Force Click for Layer Selection</h2>

<p>What if, when you used Force click, it let you dig into the layers beneath where you are clicking and pick one?</p>

<p>I think this motion would be intuitive, because you‚Äôre clicking <em>deeper,</em> which already feels like you‚Äôre probing <em>depth</em>-wise‚Äîi.e., <em>down</em> into the stack of layers.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

      <title>An Open Letter Against Apple&#39;s Privacy-Invasive Content Scanning Technology</title>
      <link>https://appleprivacyletter.com/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___appleprivacyletter_com_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="letter">
			<h2>Dear Apple,</h2>
			<p>
				On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" target="_blank">announced</a> new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of <em>‚ÄúExpanded Protections for Children‚Äù</em>. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, <strong>Apple&#39;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple&#39;s proposed technology works by <strong>continuously monitoring all photos stored or shared on a user&#39;s iPhone, iPad or Mac</strong>, and notifying the authorities if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately after Apple&#39;s announcement, experts around the world sounded the alarm on how Apple&#39;s proposed measures could turn every iPhone into a device that is continuously scanning all photos and messages that pass through it in order to report any objectionable content to law enforcement, setting a precedent where our personal devices become a radical new tool for invasive surveillance, with little oversight to prevent eventual abuse and unreasonable expansion of the scope of surveillance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation has said</a> that <strong><em>‚ÄúApple is opening the door to broader abuses‚Äù</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger‚Äôs encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses [‚Ä¶] That‚Äôs not a slippery slope; that‚Äôs a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://cdt.org/press/cdt-apples-changes-to-messaging-and-photo-services-threaten-users-security-and-privacy/" target="_blank">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> has said that it is <strong><em>‚Äúdeeply concerned that Apple‚Äôs changes in fact create new risks to children and all users, and mark a significant departure from long-held privacy and security protocols‚Äù</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄúApple is replacing its industry-standard end-to-end encrypted messaging system with an infrastructure for surveillance and censorship, which will be vulnerable to abuse and scope-creep not only in the U.S., but around the world,‚Äù says Greg Nojeim, Co-Director of CDT‚Äôs Security &amp; Surveillance Project. ‚ÄúApple should abandon these changes and restore its users‚Äô faith in the security and integrity of their data on Apple devices and services.‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Carmela Troncoso, a leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554795487518723" target="_blank">has said</a> that while <strong><em>‚ÄúApple&#39;s new detector for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is promoted under the umbrella of child protection and privacy, it is a firm step towards prevalent surveillance and control‚Äù</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Matthew D. Green, another leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green" target="_blank">has said</a> that <strong><em>‚Äúyesterday we were gradually headed towards a future where less and less of our information had to be under the control and review of anyone but ourselves. For the first time since the 1990s we were taking our privacy back. Today we‚Äôre on a different path‚Äù</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/" target="_blank">adding</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄúThe pressure is going to come from the UK, from the US, from India, from China. I&#39;m terrified about what that&#39;s going to look like. Why Apple would want to tell the world, ‚ÄòHey, we&#39;ve got this tool‚Äô?‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Sarah Jamie Lewis, Executive Director of the <a href="https://openprivacy.ca" target="_blank">Open Privacy Research Society</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1423403656733290496" target="_blank">has warned</a> that:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄúIf Apple are successful in introducing this, how long do you think it will be before the same is expected of other providers? Before walled-garden prohibit apps that don&#39;t do it? Before it is enshrined in law? How long do you think it will be before the database is expanded to include &#34;terrorist&#34; content&#34;? &#34;harmful-but-legal&#34; content&#34;? state-specific censorship?‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Nadim Kobeissi, a researcher in Security &amp; Privacy issues, <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423388549529968645">warned</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄùApple sells iPhones without FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, because local regulation prohibits encrypted phone calls. That&#39;s just one example of many where Apple&#39;s bent to local pressure. What happens when local regulations in Saudi Arabia mandate that messages be scanned not for child sexual abuse, but for homosexuality or for offenses against the monarchy?‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">statement</a> on the issue supports the above concern with additional examples on how Apple&#39;s proposed technology could lead to global abuse:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				‚ÄúTake the example of India, where recently passed rules include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù in 24 hours may apply to messaging services. And many other countries‚Äîoften those with authoritarian governments‚Äîhave passed similar laws. Apple‚Äôs changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers.‚Äù
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the Electronic Frontier Foundation insists that it&#39;s already seen this mission creep in action: <strong><em>‚Äúone of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite calls from civil society.‚Äù</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Fundamental design flaws in Apple&#39;s proposed approach have also been pointed out by experts, who have <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423387147172724741" target="_blank">claimed</a> that <strong><em>‚ÄúApple can trivially use different media fingerprinting datasets for each user. For one user it could be child abuse, for another it could be a much broader category‚Äù</em></strong>, thereby enabling selective content tracking for targeted users.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type of technology that Apple is proposing for its child protection measures depends on an expandable infrastructure that can&#39;t be monitored or technically limited. Experts have <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554811086188548" target="_blank">repeatedly warned</a> that the problem isn&#39;t just privacy, but also the lack of accountability, technical barriers to expansion, and lack of analysis or even acknowledgement of the potential for errors and false positives.
 			</p>
			 <p>
				 Kendra Albert, a lawyer at the Harvard Law School&#39;s Cyberlaw Clinic, <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114" target="_blank">has warned</a> that <strong><em>‚Äúthese &#34;child protection&#34; features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse‚Äù</em></strong>, adding:
			 </p>
			 <blockquote>
				‚ÄúI just know (calling it now) that these machine learning algorithms are going to flag transition photos. Good luck texting your friends a picture of you if you have &#34;female presenting nipples.&#34;‚Äù
			 </blockquote>
			 <h3>Our Request</h3>
			 <p>
				 We, the undersigned, ask that:
			 </p>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Apple Inc.&#39;s&#39; deployment of its proposed content monitoring technology is halted immediately.</li>
				 <li>Apple Inc. issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to end-to-end encryption and to user privacy.</li>
			 </ol>
			 <p>
				 Apple&#39;s current path threatens to undermine decades of work by technologists, academics and policy advocates towards strong privacy-preserving measures being the norm across a majority of consumer electronic devices and use cases. We ask that Apple reconsider its technology rollout, lest it undo that important work.
			 </p>

      <title>Haskell for the Elm Enthusiast</title>
      <link>https://blog.noredink.com/post/658510851000713216/haskell-for-the-elm-enthusiast</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>Many years ago NRI adopted Elm as a frontend language. We started small with a disposable proof of concept, and as the engineering team increasingly was bought into Elm being a <em>much</em> better developer experience than JavaScript more and more of our frontend development happened in Elm. Today almost all of our frontend is written in Elm.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the backend, we use Ruby on Rails. Rails has served us well and has supported amazing growth of our website, both in terms of the features it supports, and the number of students and teachers who use it. But we‚Äôve come to miss some of the tools that make us so productive in Elm: Tools like custom types for modeling data, or the type checker and its helpful error messages, or the ease of writing (fast) tests.</p><p>A couple of years ago we started looking into Haskell as an alternative backend language that could bring to our backend some of the benefits we experience writing Elm in the frontend. Today some key parts of our backend code are written in Haskell. Over the years we‚Äôve developed our style of writing Haskell, which can be described as very Elm-like (it‚Äôs also still changing!).</p><p>Elm is a small language with great error messages, great documentation, and a great community. Together these make Elm one of the nicest programming languages <em>to learn</em>. Participants in an <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/elmbridge/curriculum">ElmBridge</a> event will go from knowing nothing of the language to writing a real application using Elm in 5 hours.</p><p>We have a huge amount of Elm code at NoRedInk, and it supports some pretty tricky UI work. Elm scales well to a growing and increasingly complicated codebase. The compiler stays fast and we don‚Äôt lose confidence in our ability to make changes to our code. You can learn more about our Elm story <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs">here</a>.</p><p>Haskell shares a lot of the language features we like in Elm: Custom types to help us model our data. Pure functions and explicit side effects. Writing code without runtime exceptions (mostly).</p><p>When it comes to ease of learning, Haskell makes different trade-offs than Elm. The language is much bigger, especially when including the many optional language features that can be enabled. It‚Äôs entirely up to you whether you want to use these features in your code, but you‚Äôll need to know about many of them if you want to make use of Haskell‚Äôs packages, documentation, and how-tos. Haskell‚Äôs compiler errors typically aren‚Äôt as helpful as Elm‚Äôs are. Finally, we‚Äôve read many Haskell books and blog posts, but haven‚Äôt found anything getting us from knowing no Haskell to writing a real application in it that‚Äôs anywhere near as small and effective as the <a href="https://href.li/?https://guide.elm-lang.org/">Elm Guide</a>.</p><p>Many of the niceties we‚Äôre used to in Elm we get in Haskell too. But Haskell has many additional features, and each one we use adds to the list of things that an Elm programmer will need to learn. So instead we took a path that many in the Haskell community took before us: limit ourselves to a subset of the language.</p><p>There are many styles of writing Haskell, each with its own trade-offs. Examples include Protolude, RIO, the lens ecosystem, and many more. Our approach differs in being strongly inspired by Elm. So what does our Elm-inspired style of writing Haskell look like?</p><h2>üçá Low hanging fruit: the Elm standard library</h2><p>Our earliest effort in making our Haskell code more Elm-like was porting the Elm standard library to Haskell. We‚Äôve open-sourced this port as a library named <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude"><code>nri-prelude</code></a>. It contains Haskell counterparts of the Elm modules for working with <code>String</code>s, <code>List</code>s, <code>Dict</code>s, and more.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude"><code>nri-prelude</code></a> also includes a port of <code>elm-test</code>. It provides everything you need for writing unit tests and basic property tests.</p><p>Finally, it includes a GHC plugin that makes it so Haskell‚Äôs default <code>Prelude</code> (basically its standard library) behaves like Elm‚Äôs defaults. For example, it adds implicit qualified imports of some modules like <code>List</code>, similar to what Elm does.</p><h2>üéöÔ∏è Effects and the Absence of The Elm Architecture</h2><p>Elm is opinionated in supporting a single architecture for frontend applications, fittingly called The Elm Architecture. One of its nice qualities is that it forces a separation of application logic (all those conditionals and loops) and effects (things like talking to a database or getting the current time). We love using The Elm Architecture writing frontend applications, but don‚Äôt see a way to apply it 1:1 to backend development. In the F# community, they use the Elm Architecture for <em>some</em> backend features (see: <a href="https://href.li/?https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/feature-clientserver-bridge/#when-to-use-elmishbridge">When to use Elmish Bridge</a>), but it‚Äôs not generally applicable. We‚Äôd still like to encourage that separation between application logic and effects though, having seen some of the effects of losing that distinction in our backend code. Read our other post <a href="https://href.li/?https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Pufferfish-please-scale-the-site-Vbuh8hFWzDYm0FAjNUoaW">+‚òÑÔ∏è Pufferfish, please scale the site!</a> if you want to read more about this.</p><p>Out of many options we‚Äôre currently using <a href="https://href.li/?https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2018-03-08-handle-pattern.html">the handle pattern</a> for managing effects. For each type of effect, we create a <code>Handler</code> type (we added the extra <code>r</code> in a typo way back and it has stuck around. Sorry). We use this pattern across our libraries for talking to outside systems: <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-postgresql"><code>nri-postgresql</code></a>, <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-http"><code>nri-http</code></a>, <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-redis"><code>nri-redis</code></a>, and <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-kafka"><code>nri-kafka</code></a>.</p><p>Without The Elm Architecture, we depend heavily on chaining permutations through a stateful <code>Task</code> type. This feels similar to imperative coding: First, do A, then B, then C. Hopefully, when we‚Äôre later on in our Haskell journey, we‚Äôll discover a nice architecture to simplify our backend code.</p><h2>üöö Bringing Elm Values to Haskell</h2><p>One way in which Haskell is different from both Elm and Rails is that it is not particularly opinionated. Often the Haskell ecosystem offers multiple different ways to do one particular thing. So whether it‚Äôs writing an http server, logging, or talking with a database, the first time we do any of these things we‚Äôll need to decide <em>how</em>.</p><p><strong>When adopting a Haskell feature or library, we care about</strong></p><ul><li>smallness, e.g. introduce new concepts only when necessary</li><li>how ‚Äúmagical‚Äù is it? E.g. How <em>surprising</em> is it?</li><li>How easy is it to <em>learn</em>?</li><li>how easy is it to <em>use?</em></li><li>how comprehensible is the documentation?</li><li><em>explicitness</em> over <em>terseness (</em>but terseness isn‚Äôt implicitly bad).</li><li>consistency &amp; predictability</li><li>‚Äúsafety‚Äù (no runtime exceptions).</li></ul><p>Sometimes the Haskell ecosystem provides an option that fits our Elm values, like with the handle pattern, and so we go with it. Other times a library has different values, and then the choice not to use it is easy as well. An example of this is lens/prism ecosystem, which allows one to write super succinct code, but is almost a language onto itself that one has to learn first.</p><p>The hardest decisions are the ones where an approach protects us against making mistakes in some way (which we like) but requires familiarity with more language features to use (which we prefer to avoid).</p><p>To help us make better decisions, we often <strong>try it both ways.</strong> That is, we‚Äôre willing to build a piece of software with &amp; without a complex language feature to ensure the <em>cost</em> of the complexity is worth the benefit that the feature brings us.</p><p>Another approach we take is making decisions locally. A single team might evaluate a new feature, and then demo it and share it with other teams after they have a good sense the feature is worth it. Remember: a super-power of Haskell is easy refactorability. Unlike our ruby code, going through and doing major re-writes in our Haskell codebase is often an hours-or-days-long (rather than weeks-or-months-long) endeavor. Adopting two different patterns simultaneously has a relatively small cost!</p><h2>Case studies in feature adoption:</h2><h3>üêò Type-Check All Elephants</h3><p>One example where our approach is Elm-like in some ways but not in others is how we talk to the database. We‚Äôre using a GHC feature called quasiquoting for this, which allow us to embed SQL query strings directly into our Haskell code, like this:</p><pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

module Animals (listAll) where

import Postgres (query, sql)

listAll :: Postgres.Handler -&gt; Task Text (List (Text, Text))
listAll postgres =
  query postgres [sql|SELECT species, genus FROM animals|]
</code></pre><p>A library called <a href="https://href.li/?https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-typed"><code>postgresql-typed</code></a> can test these queries against a real Postgres database and show us an error at compile time if the query doesn‚Äôt fit the data. Such a compile-time error might happen if a table or column we reference in a query doesn‚Äôt exist in the database. This way we use static checks to eliminate a whole class of potential app/database compatibility problems!</p><p>The downside is that writing code like this requires everyone working with it to learn a bit about quasi quotes, and what return type to expect for different kinds of queries. That said, using some kind of querying library instead has a learning curve too, and query libraries tend to be pretty big to support all the different kinds of queries that can be made.</p><h3>üî£ So Many Webserver Options</h3><p>Another example where we traded additional safety against language complexity is in our choice of webserver library. We went with <code>servant</code> here, a library that lets you express REST APIs using types, like this:</p><pre><code>import Servant

data Routes route = Routes
  { listTodos ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Get &#39;\[JSON\] [Todo],
    updateTodo ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Capture &#34;id&#34; Int
        :&gt; ReqBody &#39;[JSON] Todo
        :&gt; Put &#39;[JSON] NoContent,
    deleteTodo ::
      route
        :- &#34;todos&#34;
        :&gt; Capture &#34;id&#34; Int
        :&gt; Delete &#39;[JSON] NoContent
  }
  deriving (Generic)
</code></pre><p>Servant is a big library that makes use of a lot of type-level programming techniques, which are pretty uncommon in Elm, so there‚Äôs a steep learning cost associated with <em>understanding</em> how the type magic works. Using it without a deep understanding is reasonably straightforward.</p><p>The benefits gained from using Servant outweigh the cost of expanded complexity. Based on a type like the one in the example above, the servant ecosystem can generate functions in other languages like Elm or Ruby. Using these functions means we can save time with backend-to-frontend or service-to-service communication. If some Haskell type changes in a backward-incompatible fashion we will generate new Elm code, and this might introduce a compiler error on the Elm side.</p><p>So for now we‚Äôre using servant! It‚Äôs important to note that what we <em>want</em> is compile-time server/client compatibility checking, and that‚Äôs why we swallow Servant‚Äôs complexity. If we could get the same benefit without the type-level programming demonstrated above, we would prefer that. Hopefully, in the future, another library will offer the same benefits from a more Elm-like API.</p><p>We‚Äôre running the libraries discussed above in production. Our most-used Haskell application receives hundreds of thousands of requests per minute without issue and produces hardly any errors.</p><p>Code can be found at <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/NoRedInk/haskell-libraries"><code>NoRedInk/haskell-libraries</code></a>. Libraries have been published to hackage and stackage. We‚Äôd love to know what you think!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span>Apple has announced impending changes to its operating systems that include new ‚Äúprotections for children‚Äù features in iCloud and iMessage. If you‚Äôve spent any time </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjwpmn/ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"><span>following the Crypto Wars</span></a><span>, you know what this means: Apple is planning to build a backdoor into its data storage system and its messaging system.</span></p>
<p><span>Child exploitation is a serious problem, and Apple isn&#39;t the first tech company to bend its privacy-protective stance in an attempt to combat it. But that choice will come at a high price for overall user privacy. Apple can </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"><span>explain at length</span></a><span> how its technical implementation will preserve privacy and security in its proposed backdoor, but at the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>To say that we are disappointed by Apple‚Äôs plans is an understatement. Apple has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/bay-area-rallies-against-fbi-threats-privacy-and-security"><span>historically been a champion</span></a><span> of end-to-end encryption, for all of the same reasons that EFF has articulated </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/dont-let-encrypted-messaging-become-hollow-promise"><span>time</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-bill-governments-not-so-secret-plan-scan-every-message-online"><span>and</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/fbi-should-stop-attacking-encryption-and-tell-congress-about-all-encrypted-phones"><span>time</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/eff-joins-32-civil-liberties-groups-and-companies-ask-obama-reject-anti-encryption"><span>again</span></a><span>. Apple‚Äôs compromise on end-to-end encryption may </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT"><span>appease government agencies</span></a><span> in the U.S. and abroad, but it is a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company‚Äôs leadership in privacy and security. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>There are two main features that the company is planning to install in every Apple device. One is a scanning feature that will scan all photos as they get uploaded into iCloud Photos to see if they match a photo in the database of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) maintained by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). The other feature scans all iMessage images sent or received by child accounts‚Äîthat is, accounts designated as owned by a minor‚Äîfor sexually explicit material, and if the child is young enough, notifies the parent when these images are sent or received. This feature can be turned on or off by parents. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>When Apple releases these </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>‚Äúclient-side scanning‚Äù</span></a><span> functionalities, users of iCloud Photos, child users of iMessage, and anyone who talks to a minor through iMessage will have to carefully consider their </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan"><span>privacy and security priorities</span></a><span> in light of the changes, and possibly be unable to safely use what until this development is one of the preeminent encrypted messengers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Apple Is Opening the Door to Broader Abuses</b></h3>
<p><span>We‚Äôve said it </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>before</span></a><span>, and we‚Äôll say it again now: it‚Äôs impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger‚Äôs encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses.</span></p>
<p><span> That‚Äôs not a slippery slope; that‚Äôs a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.</span></p>
<p><span>All it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children‚Äôs, but anyone‚Äôs accounts. That‚Äôs not a slippery slope; that‚Äôs a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change. Take the example of India, where recently passed </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/indias-draconian-rules-internet-platforms-threaten-user-privacy-and-undermine"><span>rules</span></a><span> include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù in 24 hours </span><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ethiopias-hate-speech-and-disinformation-law-the-pros-the-cons-and-a-mystery/"><span>may apply to messaging services.</span></a><span> And many other countries‚Äîoften those with authoritarian governments‚Äîhave </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/indonesias-proposed-online-intermediary-regulation-may-be-most-repressive-yet"><span>passed</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/turkey-doubles-down-violations-digital-privacy-and-free-expression"><span>similar</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/proposed-new-internet-law-mauritius-raises-serious-human-rights-concerns"><span>laws</span></a><span>. Apple‚Äôs changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>We‚Äôve already seen this mission creep in action. One of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/one-database-rule-them-all-invisible-content-cartel-undermines-freedom-1"><span>database of ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù content</span></a><span> that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the </span><a href="https://gifct.org/"><span>Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism</span></a><span> (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/human-rights-ngos-in-coalition-letter-to-gifct/"><span>calls from civil society</span></a><span>. While it‚Äôs therefore impossible to know whether the database has overreached, we do know that platforms </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content"><span>regularly flag critical content</span></a> <span>as ‚Äúterrorism,‚Äù including documentation of violence and repression, counterspeech, art, and satire. <br/></span></p>
<h3><b>Image Scanning on iCloud Photos: A Decrease in Privacy<br/></b></h3>
<p><span>Apple‚Äôs plan for scanning photos that get uploaded into iCloud Photos is similar in some ways to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/dont-let-encrypted-messaging-become-hollow-promise"><span>Microsoft‚Äôs PhotoDNA</span></a><span>. The main product difference is that Apple‚Äôs scanning will happen on-device. The (unauditable) database of processed CSAM images will be distributed in the operating system (OS), the processed images transformed so that users cannot see what the image is, and matching done on those transformed images using private set intersection where the device will not know whether a match has been found. This means that when the features are rolled out, a version of the NCMEC CSAM database will be uploaded onto every single iPhone. The result of the matching will be sent up to Apple, but Apple can only tell that matches were found once a sufficient number of photos have matched a preset threshold.</span></p>
<p><span>Once a certain number of photos are detected, the photos in question will be sent to human reviewers within Apple, who determine that the photos are in fact part of the CSAM database. If confirmed by the human reviewer, those photos will be sent to NCMEC, and the user‚Äôs account disabled. Again, the bottom line here is that whatever privacy and security aspects are in the technical details, all photos uploaded to iCloud will be scanned.</span></p>
<p><span>Make no mistake: this is a decrease in privacy for all iCloud Photos users, not an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, although Apple holds the keys to view Photos stored in iCloud Photos, it does not scan these images. Civil liberties organizations have </span><a href="https://fixitalready.eff.org/apple"><span>asked the company</span></a><span> to remove its ability to do so. But Apple is choosing the opposite approach and giving itself </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> knowledge of users‚Äô content.</span></p>
<h3><b>Machine Learning and Parental Notifications in iMessage: A Shift Away From Strong Encryption<br/></b></h3>
<p><span>Apple‚Äôs second main new feature is two kinds of notifications based on scanning photos sent or received by iMessage. To implement these notifications, Apple will be rolling out an on-device machine learning classifier designed to detect ‚Äúsexually explicit images.‚Äù According to Apple, these features will be limited (at launch) to U.S. users under 18 who have been enrolled in a </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/families-and-kids"><span>Family Account</span></a><span>. In these new processes, if an account held by a child under 13 wishes to send an image that the on-device machine learning classifier determines is a sexually explicit image, a notification will pop up, telling the under-13 child that their parent will be notified of this content. If the under-13 child still chooses to send the content, they have to accept that the ‚Äúparent‚Äù will be notified, and the image will be irrevocably saved to the parental controls section of their phone for the parent to view later. For users between the ages of 13 and 17, a similar warning notification will pop up, though without the parental notification. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, if the under-13 child </span><i><span>receives</span></i><span> an image that iMessage deems to be ‚Äúsexually explicit‚Äù, before being allowed to view the photo, a notification will pop up that tells the under-13 child that their parent will be notified that they are receiving a sexually explicit image. Again, if the under-13 user accepts the image, the parent is notified and the image is saved to the phone. Users between 13 and 17 years old will similarly receive a warning notification, but a notification about this action will not be sent to their parent‚Äôs device. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>This means that if‚Äîfor instance‚Äîa minor using an iPhone without these features turned on sends a photo to another minor who does have the features enabled, they do not receive a notification that iMessage considers their image to be ‚Äúexplicit‚Äù or that the recipient‚Äôs parent will be notified. The recipient‚Äôs parents will be informed of the content without the sender consenting to their involvement. Additionally, once sent or received, the ‚Äúsexually explicit image‚Äù cannot be deleted from the under-13 user‚Äôs device.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether sending or receiving such content, the under-13 user has the option to decline without the parent being notified. Nevertheless, these notifications give the sense that Apple is watching over the user‚Äôs shoulder‚Äîand in the case of under-13s, that‚Äôs essentially what Apple has given parents the ability to do.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>These notifications give the sense that Apple is watching over the user‚Äôs shoulder‚Äîand in the case of under-13s, that‚Äôs essentially what Apple has given parents the ability to do.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>It is also important to note that Apple has chosen to use the notoriously </span><a href="https://facctconference.org/2021/acceptedpapers.html"><span>difficult-to-audit</span></a><span> technology of machine learning classifiers to determine what constitutes a sexually explicit image. We know from years of documentation and research that machine-learning technologies, used without human oversight, have a habit of wrongfully classifying content, including supposedly ‚Äúsexually explicit‚Äù content. When blogging platform Tumblr </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/dear-tumblr-banning-adult-content-wont-make-your-site-better-it-will-harm-sex"><span>instituted a filter for sexual content</span></a><span> in 2018, it famously caught all sorts of other imagery in the net, including pictures of Pomeranian puppies, selfies of fully-clothed individuals, and more. Facebook‚Äôs attempts to police nudity have resulted in the removal of pictures of famous statues such as Copenhagen‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/12081589/Copenhagen-Little-Mermaid-statue-Facebook-accused-of-censoring-photo.html"><span>Little Mermaid</span></a><span>. These filters have a history of chilling expression, and there‚Äôs plenty of reason to believe that Apple‚Äôs will do the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the detection of a ‚Äúsexually explicit image‚Äù will be using on-device machine learning to scan the contents of messages, Apple will no longer be able to honestly call iMessage ‚Äúend-to-end encrypted.‚Äù Apple and its proponents may argue that scanning before or after a message is encrypted or decrypted keeps the ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù promise intact, but that would be semantic maneuvering to cover up a tectonic shift in the company‚Äôs stance toward strong encryption. <br/></span></p>
<h3><b>Whatever Apple Calls It, It‚Äôs No Longer Secure Messaging</b></h3>
<p><span>As a reminder, a secure messaging system is a system where no one but the user and their intended recipients can read the messages or otherwise analyze their contents to infer what they are talking about. Despite messages passing through a server, an end-to-end encrypted message will not allow the server to know the contents of a message. When that same server has a channel for revealing information about the contents of a significant portion of messages, that‚Äôs not end-to-end encryption. In this case, while Apple will never see the images sent or received by the user, it has still created the classifier that scans the images that would provide the notifications to the parent. Therefore, it would now be possible for Apple to add new training data to the classifier sent to users‚Äô devices or send notifications to a wider audience, easily censoring and chilling speech.</span></p>
<p><span>But even without such expansions, this system will give parents who do not have the best interests of their children in mind one more way to monitor and control them, limiting the internet‚Äôs potential for expanding the world of those whose lives would otherwise be restricted. And because family sharing plans may be organized by abusive partners, it&#39;s not a stretch to imagine using this feature as </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/fighting-disciplinary-technologies"><span>a form of stalkerware</span></a><span>. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>People have the right to communicate privately without backdoors or censorship, including when those people are minors. Apple should make the right decision: keep these backdoors off of users‚Äô devices.</span></p>

      <p>People are using L√ñVR for game jams, commercial projects, tools, education, and VR/3D/2D prototyping. Some daring souls have even embedded L√ñVR inside of Unity, ported the engine to other languages, and gotten it running on tiny microcontrollers. With the power of L√ñVR, you can turn virtually any idea into reality.</p>

			<div>
	<p>Postgres.app is a full-featured PostgreSQL installation packaged as a standard Mac app.
It includes everything you need to get started:
we‚Äôve even included popular extensions like <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> for geo data and <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">plv8</a> for JavaScript.</p>

<p>Postgres.app has a beautiful user interface and a convenient menu bar item.
You never need to touch the command line to use it ‚Äì but of course we do include all the necessary <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">command line tools</a> and header files for advanced users.</p>

<p>Postgres.app can install minor updates automatically, so you get bugfixes as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="installing-postgresapp">Installing Postgres.app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Download ¬† ‚ûú ¬† Move to Applications folder ¬† ‚ûú ¬† Double Click</p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t move Postgres.app to the Applications folder, you will see a warning about an unidentified developer and won&#39;t be able to open it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click &#34;Initialize&#34; to create a new server</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Configure your <tt>$PATH</tt> to use the included command line tools (optional):</p>
		<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &amp;&amp;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Done! You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with these default settings:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>Host</td>
		<td>localhost</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Port</td>
		<td>5432</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User</td>
		<td>your system user name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database</td>
		<td>same as user</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>none</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Connection URL</td>
		<td>postgresql://localhost</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To connect with psql, double click a database. To connect directly from the command line, type <code>psql</code>. If you‚Äôd rather use a graphical client, see below.</p>

<p>NOTE: These instructions assume that you‚Äôve never installed PostgreSQL on your Mac before.
If you have previously installed PostgreSQL using homebrew, MacPorts, the EnterpriseDB installer, consider <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/remove.html">removing other PostgreSQL installations</a> first.
We also have <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/update.html">instructions for upgrading from older versions of Postgres.app</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphical-clients">Graphical Clients</h2>

<p>Postgres.app includes <code>psql</code>, a versatile command line client for PostgreSQL.
But it‚Äôs not the only option; there are plenty of great graphical clients available for PostgreSQL.
Two popular tools are:</p>

<ul>
	<li id="pgadmin"><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a></li>
	<li id="postico"><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a> is a feature rich open source PostgreSQL client.
It has support for almost every feature in PostgreSQL.
The only downside is that the cross-plattform UI really doesn‚Äôt live up to the expectations of a native Mac app.</p>

<p><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> on the other hand, is a very modern Mac app.
It‚Äôs made by the same people that maintain Postgres.app, and we think you‚Äôll like it! 
We put a lot of effort into making it a joy to use.
However, it doesn‚Äôt have the extensive feature set of pgAdmin, and it‚Äôs a commercial app rather than open source.</p>

<p>Aside from those two options, there are a lot more to choose from! Check the documentation for a <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/gui-tools.html">list of amazing Mac apps for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-connect">How to connect</h2>

<p>After your PostgreSQL server is up and running, you‚Äôll probably want to connect to it from your application.
Here‚Äôs how to connect to PostgreSQL from popular programming languages and frameworks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">PHP</dt>
	<dd>
			<p>
				To connect from PHP, make sure that it supports PostgreSQL.
				The version included with macOS doesn&#39;t support PostgreSQL.
				We recommend <a href="https://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for an easy way to install a current version of PHP that works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use PDO (object oriented):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$db = new PDO(&#39;pgsql:host=localhost&#39;);
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
$statement-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[&#34;datname&#34;]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				Or the <tt>pg_connect()</tt> functions (procedural):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$conn = pg_connect(&#34;host=localhost&#34;);
$result = pg_query($conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[0]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Python</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			To connect to a PostgreSQL server with Python, please first install the psycopg2 library:
		</p>
		<pre><code>
pip install psycopg2
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Django</h3>
		<p>In your settings.py, add an entry to your DATABASES setting:</p>
		<pre><code>
DATABASES = {
    &#34;default&#34;: {
        &#34;ENGINE&#34;: &#34;django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2&#34;,
        &#34;NAME&#34;: &#34;[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;,
        &#34;USER&#34;: &#34;[YOUR_USER_NAME]&#34;,
        &#34;PASSWORD&#34;: &#34;&#34;,
        &#34;HOST&#34;: &#34;localhost&#34;,
        &#34;PORT&#34;: &#34;&#34;,
    }
}
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Flask</h3>
		<p>When using the <a href="https://packages.python.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a> extension you can add to your application code:</p>
		<pre><code>
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = &#39;postgresql://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#39;
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>SQLAlchemy</h3>
		<pre><code>
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(&#39;postgresql://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#39;)
		</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Ruby</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>To install the pg gem, make sure you have set up your <tt>$PATH</tt> correctly (see <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">Command-Line Tools</a>), then execute the following command:</p>
		<pre><code>sudo ARCHFLAGS=&#34;-arch x86_64&#34; gem install pg</code></pre>
		
		<h3>Rails</h3>
		<p>In config/database.yml, use the following settings:</p>
		<pre><code>
development:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: [YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]
    host: localhost
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Sinatra</h3>
		<p>In config.ru or your application code:</p>
		<pre><code>
set :database, &#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;
		</code></pre>
		<h3>ActiveRecord</h3>
		<p>Install the activerecord gem and require &#39;active_record&#39;, and establish a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(&#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>DataMapper</h3>
		<p>Install and require the datamapper and do_postgres gems, and create a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
DataMapper.setup(:default, &#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
		<h3>Sequel</h3>
		<p>Install and require the sequel gem, and create a database connection:</p>
		<pre><code>
DB = Sequel.connect(&#34;postgres://localhost/[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]&#34;)
		</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Java</dt>
	<dd>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Download and install the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html">PostgreSQL JDBC driver</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Connect to the JDBC URL <tt>jdbc:postgresql://localhost</tt>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For more information see the official <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/index.html">PostgreSQL JDBC documentation</a>.</p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">C</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			libpq is the native C client library for connecting to PostgreSQL. It&#39;s really easy to use:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#include &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;
int main() {
    PGconn *conn = PQconnectdb(&#34;postgresql://localhost&#34;);
    if (PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_OK) {
        PGresult *result = PQexec(conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; PQntuples(result); i++) {
            char *value = PQgetvalue(result, i, 0);
            if (value) printf(&#34;%s\n&#34;, value);
        }
        PQclear(result);
    }
    PQfinish(conn);
}</code></pre>
		<p>Now compile the file with clang and run it:</p>
		<pre><code>clang main.c -I$(pg_config --includedir) -L$(pg_config --libdir) -lpq
./a.out</code></pre>
	</dd>
	
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">Swift</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			You can just use the C API in Swift! First include libpq in your bridging header:
		</p>
		<pre><code>#import &lt;libpq-fe.h&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>
			Then make sure to link with libpq.
		</p>
		<p>
			On iOS, you&#39;ll need to build libpq yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			On macOS you can use the system provided libpq (does not support SSL) or use libpq provided by Postgres.app
			by adding the following build settings:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tbody><tr>
				<th>Other Linker Flags</th>
				<td><tt>-lpq</tt></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Header Search Paths</th>
				<td><tt>/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/include</tt></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Library Search Paths</th>
				<td><tt>/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/lib</tt></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p>
			Now you can use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq C library</a> to connect to PostgreSQL:
		</p>
		<pre><code>let conn = PQconnectdb(&#34;postgresql://localhost&#34;.cString(using: .utf8))
if PQstatus(conn) == CONNECTION_OK {
    let result = PQexec(conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn&#34;)
    for i in 0 ..&lt; PQntuples(result) {
        guard let value = PQgetvalue(result, i, 0) else { continue }
        let dbname = String(cString: value)
        print(dbname)
    }
    PQclear(result)
}
PQfinish(conn)</code></pre>
	</dd>
</dl>

      </header>

  
  
  
      <p>Joseph Allen runs a major public health research project at Harvard University, probing how indoor air quality affects human health and cognition. He consults with companies on ventilation and air filtration, and during the pandemic he became a prominent voice on public health, writing dozens of op-eds criticizing early guidance from health authorities and debunking misconceptions about how the virus spreads. But none of it would have happened if he hadn‚Äôt washed out as an FBI recruit.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City homicide detective who opened his own investigative agency, Allen spent his teens and 20s helping with the family business. He did surveillance, undercover work, computer forensics, and skiptrace‚Äîtracking down people who left town to avoid alimony. Eventually he took over the agency, leading investigations and supervising eight agents.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI enjoyed the work and thought it was challenging,‚Äù Allen recalls. But part of him always wanted to be a scientist. He majored in environmental science at Boston College, and in his late 20s, still torn, he began to apply to graduate school even as he started the process to become an FBI agent. After 2 years of interviews and testing, the last step was a routine polygraph test. He failed the first round‚Äîthe trick questions he was asked were so obvious that he could not take them seriously. So FBI flew in one of its toughest examiners from Iraq‚Äîa hulking, jackbooted guy who got right in Allen‚Äôs face, screaming that he knew he was lying. But Allen kept cool, and after a while, the interrogator stormed out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought he would come back in the room and say, ‚ÄòCongratulations,‚Äô cause I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm crushing it,‚Äù Allen recalls. ‚ÄúBut they failed me because they said I employed countermeasures.‚Äù FBI apparently didn‚Äôt want an agent who couldn‚Äôt be unnerved by a polygraph test. And that solved Allen‚Äôs career dilemma. ‚ÄúI guarantee I‚Äôm the only public health student ever to fail an FBI lie detector polygraph in the morning and start graduate school a few hours later,‚Äù Allen says. But his investigative instincts never left him.</p>

<p>A tall, athletic-looking man with a bald head and stylish stubble, Allen directs the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he studies the effects of toxic gases emitted from furniture, carpets, and paints; stale air; and high levels of carbon dioxide. Years of studies by Allen and others have shown poorly circulated air in buildings impairs our ability to think clearly and creatively. Considering that we spend more than 90% of our lifetimes indoors, those findings have implications for personal well-being‚Äîand for businesses concerned about their bottom line.</p>

<p>‚ÄúJoe has always had a unique understanding of this range of domains‚Äîfrom how buildings work, to environmental exposure assessment, to making connections with health outcomes,‚Äù says Brent Stephens, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a tremendous number of people in this world that have worked on that whole spectrum.‚Äù</p>

<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, the previously esoteric field of indoor air quality suddenly became the focus of widespread concern. Like many of his colleagues, Allen jumped into the fray, advising school systems, police departments, entertainment companies, the Boston Symphony, and a host of other entities on how to make their indoor air healthier, during the pandemic and afterward.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCOVID really changed the conversation,‚Äù says Matt Murray, vice president of leasing at Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded developer in the United States and one of Allen‚Äôs consulting clients. Before the pandemic, the company would have to explain to bored executives why they should pay attention to indoor air. ‚ÄúNow, the CEOs are all saying, ‚ÄòWhat filters do you use? How you process the air you bring into the workspace?‚Äô‚Äù Murray says. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre ready for those conversations because we‚Äôve been working with Joe.‚Äù</p>

<p><span>After he failed</span>¬†his FBI exam, Allen became a different kind of sleuth. For his doctoral thesis at the Boston University School of Public Health, he investigated toxic flame-retardant chemicals released into the air by furniture, and found they were nearly ubiquitous. (The chemicals were later banned.) After graduation he got a job with a consulting firm, where he investigated problems such as toxic emissions from drywall and outbreaks of Legionnaires‚Äô disease, which is caused by bacteria that grow in plumbing and become aerosolized by ventilation systems, showers, or even flushed toilets. Those investigations introduced him to ‚Äúsick building syndrome,‚Äù a problem first identified in the 1970s in which the occupants experience fatigue, itchy eyes, headaches, and other symptoms. Exactly what causes these ailments isn‚Äôt clear, but exposure to contaminated air is a likely culprit. Allen became convinced that the building you work in can have more impact on your health than your doctor.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>In 2014, Allen accepted a position at Harvard, where he soon turned his attention to how the indoor environment can affect people‚Äôs cognitive abilities. Many of us have struggled to pay attention during a long staff meeting in a stuffy conference room. Research by Allen and others suggests that lassitude may not be due solely to boredom, but also to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-rich conference room air.</p>

<p>Ever since the energy shocks of the 1970s, buildings in the United States have been made as airtight and energy-efficient as possible. The result was a buildup of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. ‚ÄúGreen building standards‚Äù introduced in the late ‚Äô90s focused on reducing toxic materials and making buildings healthier as well as more sustainable, but they didn‚Äôt prioritize indoor air quality and ultimately did little to improve it.</p>

<p>In a multiyear series of experiments, Allen and his team have investigated the consequences. In the first study, published in 2015, they had 24 white-collar volunteers spend six working days in environmentally controlled office spaces at Syracuse University‚Äôs Total Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. On various days the experimenters would alter ventilation rates and levels of CO<sub>2</sub>¬†and VOCs. Each afternoon the volunteers were tested on their ability to think analytically and react to a crisis. (One test, for example put the volunteer in the role of a small-town mayor trying to react to an emergency.) All tests were double-blind: Neither the volunteers nor the study personnel knew that day‚Äôs environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The results were dramatic. When volunteers worked in well-ventilated conditions (which lowered the levels of CO<sub>2</sub>¬†and VOCs), they scored 61% higher than when they worked in typical office building conditions. When they worked in the cleanest conditions, with even lower CO<sub>2</sub>¬†levels and higher ventilation rates, their scores climbed 101%.</p>

<p>To find out whether the results held up in the real world, Allen and his team recruited 109 volunteers from 10 office buildings across the United States. Six had been renovated to create better heat and humidity control, improve ventilation, and lower the use of toxic materials. Four had not. Allen‚Äôs team gave each office worker a Fitbit-like bracelet to record heart rate, skin temperature, sleep patterns, and other physiological signs of well-being. Workers also completed a survey each day about how comfortable they felt and whether they experienced symptoms such as drowsiness or headaches. At the end of the week, they took the cognitive tests. Workers in the buildings with good ventilation and lower levels of indoor pollution scored 26.4% higher than those in the unimproved buildings. They also reported sleeping better and experiencing fewer ‚Äúsick building‚Äù symptoms.</p>

  <figcaption><p>Many sources of indoor air pollution can affect human health and cognition. These include particles and gases emitted by furniture and building materials, as well as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exhaled by a building‚Äôs occupants. Choosing better materials and improving ventilation, filtration, and air processing can help make buildings healthier.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúThis is really important, interesting work,‚Äù says Elliott Gall, an indoor air scientist at Portland State University. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great example of the kind of interdisciplinary work [that explores] the complexity of indoor air and how it affects us.‚Äù</p>

<p>Over time, Allen came to see businesspeople as natural allies who could act on his public health findings faster than government officials. He teamed up with John Macomber, a Harvard Business School lecturer and former CEO of one of the largest construction companies in New England. Macomber was impressed with Allen‚Äôs research suggesting a tiny sacrifice in energy efficiency through improved ventilation could increase a business‚Äôs bottom line by as much as 10% by decreasing absenteeism and boosting worker productivity. ‚ÄúI realized we‚Äôve been missing the boat,‚Äù Macomber says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre chasing pennies on energy when there‚Äôs thousands of dollars in productivity issues.‚Äù</p>

<p>Allen and Macomber consulted with companies and spoke at corporate conferences, making the economic case for improving ventilation and filtration as well as adjusting lighting, temperature, and humidity. ‚ÄúThe idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated,‚Äù they wrote in a book they co-authored,¬†<em>Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity</em>. ‚ÄúThere are just a handful of things we need to do to make a building healthier.‚Äù</p>

<p>Allen‚Äôs group continued to investigate how the indoor environment affects our mental state. They found that airline pilots exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>¬†levels common in cockpits did worse on Federal Aviation Administration‚Äìmandated emergency response tests than when they breathed better air. They showed that during a heat wave, students who lived in non‚Äìair-conditioned dorms had slower reaction times and poorer problem-solving skills than those with air conditioning. They showed that bringing plants and views of nature into the workplace can lower office workers‚Äô heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological indicators of stress.</p>

<p>In 2019, Allen‚Äôs team embarked on an ambitious international project to examine the long-term impacts of indoor air quality by tracking the physical and cognitive health of more than 300 office workers in 43 buildings in six countries over the course of 1 year. They mailed each worker a wristband to monitor their physiology and a small sensor to continuously measure levels of fine particulates and CO<sub>2</sub>¬†in their workspace. At predetermined times and levels of CO<sub>2</sub>¬†and particulates, the program pinged each worker‚Äôs smartphone with a quiz to test reaction time and cognitive function. The studies showed that in offices across the world, poor ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub>, and particulates (which carry VOCs) conspire to significantly impair cognitive function.</p>

<p><span>When the first reports</span>¬†of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Allen realized his years researching air quality and disease transmission in indoor environments had new relevance. ‚ÄúEven though the virus was novel, there are elements in all this that feel quite familiar,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a radiological hazard, biological hazard, or chemical hazard. We know how to assess the risk and put in appropriate controls.‚Äù</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) latched onto the idea that the virus was spread by large, exhaled droplets that float for a short time and then settle on surfaces. But scientists specializing in aerosols knew airborne viruses are more likely to ride on tinier particles exhaled when people breathe, sneeze, cough, or talk. Smaller than 5 microns, these particles can travel across a room and linger in indoor air for hours.</p>

<p>Aerosol experts such as Lidia Morawska of Australia‚Äôs Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point; Donald Milton of the University of Maryland, College Park; and Linsey Marr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the focus on larger droplets had led to wrong-headed guidance about washing packages with bleach, staying 2 meters apart‚Äîeven outdoors‚Äîand other forms of what some researchers called ‚Äúhygiene theater.‚Äù They urged policies that emphasized indoor mask wearing and less draconian regulations for people outdoors, where the virus would quickly disperse.</p>

<p>Allen signed on to that fight, collaborating with aerosol experts and public health researchers on scientific papers and bringing their case to the public. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a really good public communicator,‚Äù says Marr, who credits Allen with helping her work get the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOne of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on,‚Äù Allen says. ‚ÄúEven by late January 2020 we knew that airborne transmission of aerosols was not only likely, but probable.‚Äù Waiting for proof made no sense. ‚ÄúThis was a pandemic, an all-in moment, so why wouldn‚Äôt we have immediately deployed every strategy that could have helped?‚Äù Those strategies, Allen knew from his research, include bringing more outside air into chronically underventilated buildings and using higher efficiency filters in ventilation units.</p>
  
  <blockquote>

</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>He started waking up at 4 a.m. to write opinion pieces. His first two, in the¬†<em>Financial Times¬†</em>and¬†<em>The New York Times</em>, argued that buildings, if properly ventilated, could be formidable weapons in the fight against the virus. He and his team had measured air flow in schoolrooms under various conditions, and Allen explained that schools could easily be made safe by opening windows and buying the kind of high-efficiency particulate air purifiers sold at local home stores.</p>

<p>So much of his writing involved correcting misimpressions that he felt he was playing editorial whack-a-mole. No, he argued, you do not have to wipe your groceries with bleach. No, you do not have to avoid exercising outside. No, schools do not need to install costly air-purifying systems.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Morawska and Milton wrote an open letter to WHO‚Äîa full-throated appeal to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission. Allen was among 237 other scientists in 32 countries who signed on to the letter, which urged greater emphasis on indoor air quality. But WHO continued to downplay the importance of aerosol transmission. ‚ÄúI think some of the reluctance was that if [health authorities] say a disease is airborne, we‚Äôd have to provide N95 masks for every health worker and have negative pressure rooms in every hospital, which wasn‚Äôt possible,‚Äù Marr says.</p>

<p>Later that month, Allen and his Harvard colleague Parham Azimi published a study in the¬†<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences¬†</em>that used computer modeling to reconstruct the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak on the¬†<em>Diamond Princess¬†</em>cruise ship. By mapping the ship‚Äôs ventilation system and the locations of people who came down with the disease, they showed that only aerosols, not larger droplets, could have traveled the necessary distances through the ducts. Similar findings emerged from studies by Marr, Morawska, and others.</p>

<p>Finally, in early May, after a series of persuasive papers in major journals, WHO and CDC acknowledged that the virus was transmitted primarily by fine aerosols. (Even then, the agencies issued no major announcements but simply changed the wording on their websites.) Since then, CDC has gone further, issuing recommendations for reopening schools that stress the importance of good ventilation in addition to vaccinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen and his colleagues at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program created a website with a comprehensive guide to maintaining proper ventilation in schools, homes, and businesses. The website advises building managers to bring in as much outside air as possible‚Äîa room air exchange rate of four to six times per hour, more than double the rate in a typical office or school building. In buildings that recirculate interior air, managers should upgrade to hospital-grade MERV 13 filters, which remove up to 90% of particles 2.5 microns or smaller, rather than the typical MERV 8, which can remove as little as 20%.</p>

<p>The new focus on indoor air quality could help hasten the end of the current pandemic and perhaps even help forestall the next one. It may bring broader changes as well. Businesspeople are recognizing the value of improving indoor air to create better working conditions and add value to their properties. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing with some parts of the market‚Äînotably the higher end, real estate investment trusts, owners of multiple office buildings or apartments‚Äîis they‚Äôre thinking really hard about competing‚Äù in the post pandemic market, Macomber says. ‚ÄúAnd one way to compete is to have healthier buildings.‚Äù</p>

<p>Allen predicts that the new availability of cheap personal air quality monitors will quicken that competition and heighten people‚Äôs awareness of the indoor environment. Previously, the only way to assess indoor air quality was to hire an expensive consultant. Now, with monitors available online for less than a couple of hundred dollars, any office worker or hotel guest can quickly monitor CO<sub>2</sub>; some devices even detect VOCs. If consumers post results on websites like Yelp, businesses would be forced to pay attention. (Indeed, some building owners already boast about air quality in advertisements.)</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs going to be a fundamental rebalancing in terms of how we think about indoor spaces,‚Äù Allen says. ‚ÄúI think that people won‚Äôt tolerate sick buildings, where you feel tired, your eyes itch, you have a headache, or you‚Äôre stuffed into a closetlike office with no windows.‚Äù It‚Äôs one lasting positive from the pandemic. ‚ÄúThat era is over,‚Äù Allen says. ‚ÄúRightly so, and good riddance.‚Äù</p>

Our pattern recognition capabilities are a key determinant in defining intelligence. But we now live in a dystopian digital landscape purpose-built to undermine these capabilities, training us to mistake planned patterns for convenient and even meaningful coincidences.¬†<br/></p><p>You know the drill: email a colleague about the shit weather and start getting banner ads for cheap flights to Corsica (I hear it‚Äôs nice?); google &#34;ordination license&#34; or &#34;city hall hours&#34; and watch your inbox fill with rebates for rings and cribs. For those of us who grew up during the rise of surveillance capitalism, our online experience has been defined by the effort of separating coincidence from cause-and-effect. Today we understand, if not accept, that hyper-consumption of information online comes at the cost of being hyper-<em>consumed</em>, bled by tech companies for the that data our readings secrete: You click, and the Big Five scrape a sample of your ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù‚Äîto exploit.<br/></p><p>The real cost to this recursive construction of reality from the ephemera of our preferences is that it tailors a separate world for each individual. <br/></p><p>And when you <em>do</em> live at the center of a private world, reverse-engineered from your own search history, you begin to notice patterns that others can‚Äôt. Believe me when I say I know what it feels like to be told that you‚Äôre the only one who sees the connection‚Äîa pattern of injustice, say‚Äîand that you‚Äôre downright crazy for noticing anything at all. To manufacture meaning from mere coincidence is the essence of paranoia, the gateway to world-building your own private conspiracies‚Äîor else to an epiphany that allows you to see the world as it actually is. <br/></p><p>I want to talk about that epiphany, about taking back control of our atomized, pre-conspiracy world.¬†<br/></p><p><strong>2.¬†</strong><br/></p><p>The German psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Conrad">Klaus Conrad</a> called this premonitory state <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a></em>, defined as perceiving patterns that don&#39;t actually exist and referring them back to an unseen authority who must be pulling the strings. It‚Äôs a theory he developed as an army medical officer specializing in head traumas under the Third Reich. Today, it‚Äôs analogized to political conspiracy thinking. <br/></p><p>Consider Case No. 10: a German soldier at a filling station refuses to service a patrol that doesn‚Äôt have the proper paperwork. Chalk his behavior up to that infamous Nazi officiousness, but when the patrol returns, papers in hand, the soldier still refuses to obey orders. His pattern recognition has gone into overdrive, and he‚Äôs begun to see every detail‚Äîa locked door, these patrolmen, papers signed or unsigned‚Äîas a test. His paranoid disobedience lands him in the psych ward, where Conrad writes him up as one of 107 cases that revolutionizes the Germano-sphere‚Äôs understanding of human psychology.<br/></p><p>Conrad became famous for recognizing this oppressive emergence of patterns as a pre-psychotic state that he compared to stage-fright. It culminates in a false epiphany: an <em>apophany</em> is not a flash of insight into the true nature of reality but an aha experience (literally: <em>Aha-Erlebnis</em>) that constitutes the birth of delusion. The entire universe has ‚Äúturned back‚Äù and ‚Äúreorganized itself‚Äù to revolve around the individual, performing and corroborating his suspicions.¬†¬† <br/></p><p>Shakespeare said that all the world‚Äôs a stage. But in this case it‚Äôs staged specifically for <em>you</em>, <strong>the audience who&#39;s also the star.</strong><br/></p><p>For someone obsessed with the pathology of conspiracy, Conrad was pretty susceptible to conspiratorial thinking¬†himself. Born in Germany and raised in Vienna, his loyalties to the Nazi Party preceded his military duty. He joined in 1940 when his earlier research in hereditary epilepsy looked like promising fodder for the Nazi&#39;s monstrous sterilization laws. Maybe it was careerist opportunism, maybe it was ideological. Or maybe it takes one delusion-obsessed man to recognize another: Hitler was one of greatest conspiracy theorists of all time. <br/></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca182d52-370f-4d1b-b985-7c6777405567_600x449.png"></a></figure></div><p>Only Conrad‚Äôs scientific findings aren‚Äôt themselves delusional. In fact he ended up being one of the only Nazi scientists to be producing science without rockets, torture, or pentagrams. The traumatized soldiers he treated on the battlefield turned out to be good data, and the hundreds of cases he worked on allowed him to work out the laws of ‚ÄùGestalt‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äòpattern‚Äô) psychology, a school of thought that argues the human mind grasps in an instant not just individual elements of an information set, but entire configurations or patterns. For example, when we see alternating bars of light, they appear to be moving, even though they&#39;re not ‚Äî our brains are just recalling patterns related to the perception of motion and applying them to stationary objects. <br/></p><p>In an apophenic state, <em>everything‚Äôs</em> a pattern. And while Conrad‚Äôs stage-model uses the analogy of starring in your own one-man show, the narcissism of living online today provides plenty more. On Instagram you can filter your face, filter out unwanted followers, construct an image that you and your peers want to believe in‚Äîyou‚Äôre living a private illusion, in public, that the world reifies¬†with likes. For-profit data collection has literally ‚Äúreorganized‚Äù the world to revolve around you. As you wish it‚Äîor they will it.<br/></p><p>The true epiphany, I want to argue, is that <em>you‚Äôre </em>the one pulling the strings. Enlightenment is to realize you have more agency than your push-notifications would have you believe.¬†<br/></p><p><strong>3.</strong><br/></p><p>Here‚Äôs a better way to think: in an apophenic, information-glutted world where you can basically find evidence for any theory you want, where people inhabit separate online realities, we should focus on <em>falsifiability</em> (which can be tested for) over supportability (which cannot). ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã<br/></p><p>This what what the Austrian Jewish sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a>, refugee of the Holocaust in New Zealand and later England, laid out in his theory of science. Popper believed conspiracy theories are exactly what feeds a totalitarian state like Hitler‚Äôs¬†Germany, playing on and playing up the public‚Äôs paranoia of The Other. And authoritarians get away with it precisely because their pseudoscientific claims, masquerading as sound research, are designed to be difficult to prove ‚Äúfalse‚Äù in the heat of the moment,¬†when data sets ‚Äî not to mention a sense of the historical consequences ‚Äî are necessarily incomplete. <br/></p><p>By Popper‚Äôs lights‚Äîand, I‚Äôd argue, by the intuition of basic human decency‚Äîwe shouldn‚Äôt consider these provisional theories ‚Äúscience‚Äù at all.¬† <br/></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2474d564-e866-471a-9455-774fc48001b9_960x722.png"></a></figure></div><p>Popper‚Äôs a favorite in conspiracy theory studies, but I want to bring in an adjacent idea of his that I think is underemphasized in this context, which is that most human actions have unintended consequences. Instant advertising was supposed to yield informed consumers; the National Security Agency was supposed to protect &#34;us&#34; by exploiting &#34;them.&#34;¬†These plans went horribly wrong. But once you wake up to the idea that the world has been patterned, intentionally or unintentionally, in ways you don‚Äôt agree with, you can begin to change it. </p><p><em>The conspiracy theorist will believe that institutions can be understood completely as the result of conscious design; and as collectives, he usually ascribes to them a kind of group-personality, treating them as conspiring agents, just as if they were individual men. As opposed to this view, <strong>the social theorist should recognize that the persistence of institutions and collectives creates a problem to be solved </strong>in terms of an analysis of individual social actions and their unintended (and often unwanted) social consequences, as well as their intended ones.</em><br/></p><p>Maybe I‚Äôm the deluded one for finding reason for optimism in this idea‚Äîand not only because it saves me from letting the former Nazi Conrad¬†have the last word. Popper‚Äôs thinking offers an escape hatch from our private worlds and back into the public sphere. The social theorist is a public thinker, oriented toward improving society; the conspiracy theorist is a victim of institutions that lie beyond their control.¬†</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Leave a comment&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<pre>These efforts will evolve and expand over time.

- <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">Apple on their &#34;Expanded Protections for Children&#34;</a></pre>



<p>I am <s>broke</s> ‚Äúnon-liquid‚Äù right now. Normally, that sentence doesn‚Äôt have geopolitical ramifications on the creation of hybrid private-public surveillance state. But in my case it does.</p>



<p>It started rather innocuously. Someone couldn‚Äôt send me money. No matter what they did. They couldn‚Äôt transfer any money. Curious. We started experimenting with different friends, companies, and acquaintances. None of them could send me money. <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> wouldn‚Äôt provide any explanation. My business had been a paying customer for more than ~4+ years. And now, I was locked out. Okay. They‚Äôre hardly the only fish in the sea.</p>



<p>Except it happened again. This time with our bank, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>‚Ä†. Okay, that‚Äôs strange. They asked for more details. We sent them details. Scans of my documentation. They‚Äôd revert back a few days later for more details. And we‚Äôd send it to them again. On and on we went chasing each other around the maypole. A few weeks passed, and Mercury‚Äôs team finally cut to the chase, they asked if I was affiliated with Entity X. We said no. But it didn‚Äôt matter. They froze me out anyway.</p>



<p>In some ways, we‚Äôre lucky that they flagged the transfer, because they gave us the first clue of what was going on. A friend ended up having the insight to search for Entity X (thanks Nick!) and found that <em>they‚Äôd been sanctioned</em>. Okay. What did this have to do with me?</p>



<p>On further investigation, we found that I shared my legal name with someone working with Entity X. Great. It‚Äôs a common name, like Robert Brown or Mary Johnson. Shouldn‚Äôt it be easy to prove that I‚Äôm not person X? A little Googling later, I found that the United States Department of the Treasury has an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and they have an email address for ‚Äúreconsideration‚Äù if you‚Äôve been mistakenly placed on the sanctions list. As I‚Äôm clearly not the person they were looking to sanction, I decided that the most logical course of action would be write to them, and get their assent that I am indeed not the human that they‚Äôre looking for.</p>



<p>We wrote something up (once again, thanks Nick). And we sent it in.</p>



<p>The OFAC replied, to their credit, quite promptly with a link for false positives, and they told me to send this to the bank. Okay. Done. Except, it didn‚Äôt matter. Mercury blocked me anyway. The saga finished with me getting nada.</p>



<p>I wrote back to the OFAC requesting them to write something, anything on an official looking letterhead stating the simple fact that I, Person X born on such and such date with an ID number of Z, am not the person who has been sanctioned. I offered to provide them with additional details if there was any hesitancy on their part.</p>



<p>They haven‚Äôt replied. And I still can‚Äôt get any cash.</p>



<p>What‚Äôs amazing about this saga is that I have a statistically common legal name. There are thousands of people running around with this name. And effectively, they‚Äôve <em>all</em> been barred from the global financial system.</p>



<p>To their credit, the OFAC publishes additional details for each person to prevent this exact scenario from occurring. However, these details seem to vary across individuals and countries. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be a neat dataset to model. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists" target="_blank">the lists are available online in .PDF and .TXT files,</a> and it‚Äôs a mess. Also, there isn‚Äôt one list, but rather multiple lists, with different details. As far as I can tell, there is no <em>official</em> API. There is no efficient way for programmers designing, say a ‚Äú[bank] built for startups‚Äù to comply with the Treasury. Consequently, someone decided, in a meeting room somewhere, to punt the problem.</p>



<p>If it‚Äôs a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just run a simple match against the name ‚Äì the one element of the dataset guaranteed to be there ‚Äì and then punt it to our underpaid and understaffed KYC department to deal with? And the KYC department punted it to legal. And legal took one look and went, ‚Äúhrm, what‚Äôs our downside risk if we approve this? Do we know this person is indeed the one being sanctioned? Oh, I see. Well let‚Äôs just block them. There‚Äôs not much they can do about it.‚Äù</p>



<p>And so, I am currently <s>broke</s> non-liquid. Kafka would have been proud.</p>



<p><em>(for connoisseurs of dark humor, I find it particularly hilarious that more likely than not the person they‚Äôre targeting will never be affected by this. This person, with whom I have the misfortune of sharing a legal name, doesn‚Äôt seem to perform many international transactions. She lives in a cash-first developing country, where the sanctions have no reach. She‚Äôs but a lowly piece in a very big game)</em></p>



<hr/>



<p>In other news, Apple has decided to scan images on your phone. For child porn, of course. There aren‚Äôt enough people (nor PR capital) to look through all of your photos. So, they‚Äôve done the efficient thing instead. They‚Äôre simply going to match all of your photos, on your phone, against a hash of child porn images. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Other, more eloquent commentators,</a> have pointed out the danger this poses. Apple often bends over for authoritarian regimes like China, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/technology/apple-hong-kong-app.html">remove apps that help pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong avoid police violence</a>. Or, that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned">the company doesn‚Äôt allow adults to view adult content on the devices that they own</a>. Or, in more conservative countries, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avng9/apple-is-letting-over-150-countries-censor-lgbtq-content-in-the-app-store">removing any apps that mention the inconvenient existence of LGBTQ+ people</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">Wikipedia has an exhaustive list.</a></p>



<p>However, it is not my purpose to repeat what these commentators have already said. Nor to write a polemic for its own sake. My goal is to use my experience to peer into the future. To predict, through inevitability, the chain of events for poor souls in days yet to pass.</p>



<p>Just like the programmers who chose to match names against the sanctions list, while the KYC and legal departments handle the rest, Apple is matching all of the private photos on your phone against a list. This list is generated using something called a hash function. It turns an image into a number that a computer can then use to make the comparison. The process looks a bit like this, </p>







<p>Please note this is an example from a lovely blog that goes through this process. Apple‚Äôs process is different, but inherently similar.</p>



<p>In most cases, when we‚Äôre dealing with hashes in computer science, we‚Äôre looking for exact matches. But this case is different. Criminals aren‚Äôt stupid. They‚Äôre often not clever, but not all of them are stupid. What if they add a filter? Or, change the image somehow? Maybe add in a blur? What then?</p>



<p>Well, clearly, they can‚Äôt make every variation possible of every image that the police are looking for. If it‚Äôs a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just look for <em>similarity</em> instead and then punt it to law enforcement to deal with? To put it another way, the question Apple is asking isn‚Äôt, ‚Äúis this image exactly like this photo from the child porn database?‚Äù No, the question Apple is asking is, ‚Äúis this image similar to this photo from the child porn database?‚Äù Where the ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù question is answered by a very clever, but very dumb algorithm.</p>



<p>In my case, when the programmers punted to the KYC department and legal, a bunch of transactions were cancelled. In this case, the police will raid your house and arrest you for ‚Äúchild porn.‚Äù</p>



<p>The image they will raid you for wouldn‚Äôt even necessarily have to be an adult one. Computers are strange. They are very literal beings. They do <em>exactly</em> what they are told, which is both their greatest asset and weakness. For example, this neural network thinks that this cat is guacamole,</p>







<p>Apple‚Äôs algorithm is <em>very different</em>, but it is susceptible to the same problems. In this case, noise was added into the image to make the neural network classify the cat as guacamole. In your case, it could be just happenstance. Random noise due to lighting conditions that takes an innocent photo (or, more likely, an intimate photo of you or your partner) and makes the algorithm assume that it is <em>similar</em> to a restricted photo.</p>



<p>Just like me, one day you‚Äôll wake up and notice that something weird might be going on. Maybe it‚Äôs a car parked outside your street. Maybe it‚Äôs a feeling like people are following you. You won‚Äôt be that alarmed at first. You‚Äôll dismiss it. But, eventually, it will come crashing in. Your door will be knocked open by SWAT. And you will find yourself facing armored people in guns to your confusion. They‚Äôll scream for you to raise your hands and put them behind your head. They‚Äôll say, ‚Äúma‚Äôam we have a warrant for your arrest.‚Äù And confused, you‚Äôll be walked out to a waiting squad car.</p>



<p>Your local newspaper will write, ‚Äú[You] has been arrested for possessing child pornography.‚Äù But you won‚Äôt read the headline. You‚Äôll be in an interrogation room. Waiting for them to come in. Maybe the officer is letting you sweat it out. Maybe not. But eventually they‚Äôll come in and they‚Äôll start interrogating you. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam do you consume pornography that has minors in it?‚Äù</p>



<p>And you‚Äôll deny it. They‚Äôll put your phone in front of you. It‚Äôll be in one of those bags. You‚Äôll unlock it for them. And you‚Äôll know that they‚Äôre going to go through everything. Including that embarrassing pic you took for K.</p>



<p>They won‚Äôt find anything. So they‚Äôll return to question you. Maybe you‚Äôve deleted the photos, who knows? Let‚Äôs pass it on to forensics and see what they come up with.</p>



<p>Eventually, you‚Äôll end up being detained in jail. Your bail will be set high. You‚Äôll have to plead and explain to everyone around you that you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. You don‚Äôt know why this happened. And those near you might believe you, but there will be this doubt that crosses through their mind. Just for a second. They‚Äôll have this doubt, and that doubt will always be there for the rest of their life.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have money, you‚Äôll get a lawyer. They‚Äôll work on getting you out. Eventually, the forensics will return nothing. Your lawyer will succeed in getting you to walk free. And you‚Äôll walk back to your home, with stares from your neighbors.</p>



<p>In a few months, it‚Äôll come out that no, Apple‚Äôs algorithm screwed up here. Apple will blame law enforcement. Law enforcement will blame Apple. It doesn‚Äôt matter. That newspaper will put up a small story on their site about how you‚Äôre really innocent. It won‚Äôt get many clicks. And the one about you getting arrested for possessing child porn will stay up forever. With a note added to it, if you‚Äôre lucky.</p>



<p>Maybe you‚Äôll get your life back. Maybe not. But you‚Äôll spend the rest of your life under this cloud, because some programmer somewhere wrote this code. And everyone else assumed that it just works.</p>



<hr/>



<p><em>PS ‚Äì This has already happened many, many times. Except not for something as incendiary as child porn, nor with the exact same technology. However, these examples are included as they are illustrative;</em></p>

      <div>
      <p>Today, Acting Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine sent the following letter to Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook‚Äôs misleading claims regarding the company‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">consent decree with the FTC</a>:</p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: </span></p>

<p><span>I write concerning Facebook‚Äôs recent insinuation that its actions against an academic research project conducted by NYU‚Äôs Ad Observatory were required by the company‚Äôs consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. As the company has since acknowledged, this is inaccurate. The FTC is committed to protecting the privacy of <em>people</em>, and efforts to shield targeted advertising practices from scrutiny run counter to that mission.</span></p>

<p><span>While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter. Only last week, Facebook‚Äôs General Counsel, Jennifer Newstead, committed the company to ‚Äútimely, transparent communication to BCP staff about significant developments.‚Äù Yet the FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.</span></p>

<p><span>Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest. Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising. While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy ‚Äì much less the FTC consent order ‚Äì as a pretext to advance other aims. </span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>

<p><em><span>/s/ Samuel Levine </span></em></p>

<p><span>Acting Director</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The Russians may have been winning the space race in the 1950s, but they couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to the sophistication of Western dress.</p><figure><figcaption>In the summer of 1959, the Cold War moved from the fields of science and technology to that of cultural exchange.¬†</figcaption></figure><p>By the late 1950s, having <a href="https://www.space.com/17563-sputnik.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fired the first shot</a> in the space war, Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev extended the competition with the West to everyday culture and lifestyle. Thus, in the summer of 1959 the Cold War moved to the Ô¨Åeld of cultural exchange. The Soviets organized an exhibition of their scientiÔ¨Åc, technological, and cultural achievements in New York, and the Americans followed with their own national exhibition in Moscow. Both Russians and Americans tried to show off their best clothes on each occasion. The official repositioning of the phenomenon of fashion in socialism therefore took place within the context of a Ô¨Åght for cultural supremacy.</p><p>American vice president Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat, traveled to Moscow to open the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Fifty_Years_Ago_American_Exhibition_Stunned_Soviets_in_Cold_War/1783913.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American National Exhibition</a>. Before their visit, Pat Nixon carefully chose a new wardrobe, as reported in Newsweek:</p><blockquote><p>One suit of natural raw silk, a brown silk taffeta cocktail dress, a silk and cotton Ô¨Çowered print dress with jacket and two other dresses. Most of her clothes were bought at Henry Bendel‚Äôs in New York where Pat spent an hour‚Äîand several hundred dollars. ‚ÄúThey are costumes,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúMostly full-skirted dresses with matching accessories to make a ‚Äòpicture.‚Äô They are not high fashion and they‚Äôre the sort of thing I like, and which I think looks best on me.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>At the opening of the exhibition, in the company of her husband and the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov, Pat Nixon glowed in her natural raw silk suit and smart hat. She looked just as she was supposed to: like a sophisticated and well-heeled American housewife. The message was clear: the Russians might be ahead in space research and education, but they cannot match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady going about her everyday life.</p><p>Pat Nixon‚Äôs carefully chosen wardrobe revealed a lifestyle with which the Russians could not compete. This lifestyle was even recited by IBM‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAMAC</a>, the first commercial computer, present at the exhibition, which provided four thousand answers about different aspects of life in America. One of them offered information in perfect Russian about the wardrobe of an average American woman. She owned: <em>‚ÄúWinter coat, spring coat, raincoat, Ô¨Åve house dresses, four afternoon ‚Äòdressy‚Äô dresses, three suits, three skirts, six blouses, two petticoats, Ô¨Åve nightgowns, eight panties, Ô¨Åve brassi√®res, two corsets, two robes, six pairs of nylon stockings, two pairs of sports socks, three pairs of dress gloves, three pairs of play shorts, one pair of slacks, one play suit, and accessories.‚Äù</em></p><p>During the exhibition, American fashion was presented at four thirty-Ô¨Åve-minute-long fashion shows that took place each day, each of them attended by three thousand to Ô¨Åve thousand Russians. The Soviet authorities had opposed many of the American proposals for the exhibition, but eventually the Russian audiences got a chance to enjoy the American fashion shows, which consisted of youthful clothes, leisure wear, daily ensembles, and formal long evening dresses.</p><p>Attempting to bring the Russians ‚Äúa living slice of America,‚Äù the outÔ¨Åts were presented by professional models as well as children, teenagers, grandparents, and whole families. Newsweek described the fashion show as boring, but acknowledged the political meaning behind the clothes: ‚ÄúThe dresses were all right, though a bit on the dull side,‚Äù they reported. ‚ÄúThe whole idea behind it was to show the people of the Soviet Union how the average American woman dresses at work and at play ‚Äî not the glamorous girl on Park Avenue, but the young matron on Main Street.‚Äù The choice of everyday mass-produced American clothes was very powerful propaganda. If sophisticated outÔ¨Åts from New York fashion salons had been shown, they could easily have been attacked as elitist clothes meant for the exploiting class. But the Americans knew only too well that the Russians could not compete in the Ô¨Åeld of decent mass-produced clothing.</p><figure><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,‚Äù reported the New York Times.</p></blockquote></figure><p>While fashion contributed to the huge propaganda effect that the American National Exhibition had in Moscow, the American media commented on the shortcomings in the culture of everyday Soviet life at the Russian exchange exhibition that had taken place only two months earlier in the New York Coliseum. ‚ÄúThe Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,‚Äù <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/30/80589100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> the New York Times, ‚Äúwith clothes and furs that are rarely seen on Moscow streets.‚Äù The fashion show that was included in the exhibition drew ironic comments from Western journalists. Five female models and one male model displayed designs by Soviet fashion designers from the leading Moscow department store GUM and the <em>Dom modelei, </em>or House of Prototypes, an institution created by Stalin to produce prototypes for socialist fashion. Time magazine reported that ‚Äúthe textiles, mostly thick, heavy-textured woolen suits, are more impressive for their usefulness against the Russian winter than for their styles, which are clumsy attempts to copy western designs.‚Äù</p><p>Though the American media declared GUM‚Äôs outÔ¨Åts ‚Äúclumsy copies,‚Äù they were actually the most prestigious representations of Soviet-style elegance. In 1956, GUM‚Äôs general director, V. G. Kamenov, wrote a booklet describing in detail the services that the Soviet Ô¨Çagship department store offered. Fashion ateliers for custom-made clothes and special shops selling natural silk, artistically hand-painted silk, women‚Äôs hats, fur coats, and perfumes were supposed to present an idea of abundance and sophistication. In the illustrations accompanying the text, attentive sales personnel were shown offering customers these traditionally luxurious goods. One section of the booklet dealt with new sales techniques, while another praised the fashion salons within the store, which offered individual service in sumptuous surroundings.</p><p>The store‚Äôs interior, Ô¨Ålled with dark carved wooden furniture, crystal chandeliers, and heavy velvet curtains, was similar to the Stalinist concept of palaces of consumption of the 1930s. The store continued an outdated, grandiose aesthetics that promoted the mythical Stalinist concept of luxury. But this Stalinist gloriÔ¨Åcation of reality, which tried to remove all conÔ¨Çicting and erratic elements from everyday life, could not compete with ordinary life in the West. Thus, with the opening of the Soviet Union toward the West, the disjunction between the deprivation of everyday life and its ideal representation became blatantly obvious.</p><div><figure><figcaption>The fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Pictured in this 1959 cover of Life magazine: Pat Nixon with her Soviet counterparts: (from left) Mrs. Mikoian, Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Khrushcheva, and Mrs. Kozlova.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the late 1950s, in comparison with the efficiency of the large American department stores and the diversity and quality of the mass-produced goods that they offered, GUM had become outdated and provincial, as direct contacts with the West painfully revealed. The cover of Life magazine from August 1959 showed that the fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Flanked by Mrs. Mikoian (on her left), Nina Khrushcheva (right), and Mrs. Kozlova (far right), Pat Nixon appeared as a smartly dressed upper-class American housewife. The Life magazine cover was a visual testament to the Soviet diplomats‚Äô wives‚Äô inability to match the sophisticated, worldly style of Pat Nixon in her silk, Ô¨Çower-printed dress, a string of pearls, and carefully applied makeup, as well as her svelte Ô¨Ågure. Accompanying their husbands, the ladies attended a dinner table conference at Khrushchev‚Äôs <em>dacha</em>, or country house.</p><p>There were signiÔ¨Åcant visual differences among the three Soviet politicians‚Äô wives, which pointed to their different levels of sartorial awareness. Nina Khrushcheva was clad in the simplest dress, which buttoned at the front. Called <em>khalat</em>, this style had become a domestic uniform of Soviet women. Women wore <em>khalat</em> at home, whether going about their domestic work, cooking, resting, or entertaining. Mrs. Mikoian was dressed in a sartorially more demanding outÔ¨Åt: a suit, with a cut that discreetly shaped the body. Her suit was modest, but its proletarian asceticism was softened with a little hat. That fashion detail showed a certain investment in her look, transforming her simple suit into an outdoor outÔ¨Åt.</p><p>The formal outÔ¨Åt worn by the wife of the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov showed a full awareness of the importance of the occasion. Mrs. Kozlova‚Äôs evening gown, embellished with embroidery around the neckline, as well as her embroidered muslin stole, her white evening handbag, her white gloves, her hairstyle and makeup showed a new attitude toward fashionable dress. But Mrs. Kozlova could not yet match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady of the same social standing. The ideologically informed rejection of fashion‚Äôs history was imprinted on Mrs. Kozlova‚Äôs dress even more so than on Mrs. Mikoian‚Äôs simple suit or Nina Khrushcheva‚Äôs symbolically burdened housedress.</p><p>Mrs. Kozlova‚Äôs appearance not only acknowledged contemporary formal Western dress, but it broke an important socialist dress code. The most important members of the political bureaucracy or nomenklatura had always dressed modestly in public, a practice that had started with the Bolsheviks. Stalin and his political circle had also stuck to the proletarian ideal of modesty in their public looks, although their private lives had been loaded with all the symbols of traditional luxury, from fur coats to house help, antique furniture, and Ô¨Åne food. The Old Bolshevik wives Nina Khrushcheva and Mrs. Mikoian respected the longstanding nomenklatura dress code. Recognizing that times were changing, Mrs. Kozlova, however, dared to transgress it.</p><hr/><p><em>Djurdja Bartlett is Reader in Histories and Cultures of Fashion at the London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London, and author of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FashionEast-Spectre-Haunted-Socialism-Press/dp/0262026503" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FashionEast: The Spectre that Haunted Socialism</a>.</em>‚Äú</p></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><span><span><span>Hoping to spur crowd-sourced AI applications in health care, Stanford‚Äôs AIMI center is expanding its free repository of datasets for researchers around the world.</span></span></span></p>
      
  </div>

          <div>
        
            <div><p><span><span><span>In a move to democratize research on artificial intelligence and medicine, Stanford‚Äôs <a href="https://aimi.stanford.edu/">Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging</a> (AIMI) is dramatically expanding what is already the world‚Äôs largest free repository of AI-ready annotated medical imaging datasets.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly pervasive tool for interpreting medical images, from detecting tumors in mammograms and brain scans to analyzing ultrasound videos of a person‚Äôs pumping heart.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Many AI-powered devices now rival the accuracy of human doctors. Beyond simply spotting a likely tumor or bone fracture, some systems predict the course of a patient‚Äôs illness and make recommendations.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But AI tools have to be trained on expensive datasets of images that have been meticulously annotated by human experts. Because those datasets can cost millions of dollars to acquire or create, much of the research is being funded by big corporations that don‚Äôt necessarily share their data with the public.</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Visit the new <a href="https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/">Stanford AIMI shared dataset platform</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span><span><span>‚ÄúWhat drives this technology, whether you‚Äôre a surgeon or an obstetrician, is data,‚Äù says <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren">Matthew Lungren</a>, co-director of AIMI and an assistant professor of radiology at Stanford. ‚ÄúWe want to double down on the idea that medical data is a public good, and that it should be open to the talents of researchers anywhere in the world.‚Äù</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Launched two years ago, AIMI has already acquired annotated datasets for more than 1 million images, many of them from the Stanford University Medical Center. Researchers can download those datasets at no cost and use them to train AI models that recommend certain kinds of action. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Now, AIMI has teamed¬†up with Microsoft‚Äôs AI for Health program <a href="https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/">to launch a new platform</a> that will be more automated, accessible, and visible. It will be capable of hosting and organizing scores of additional images from institutions around the world. Part of the idea is to create an open and global repository. The platform will also provide a hub for sharing research, making it easier to refine different models and identify differences between population groups. The platform can even offer cloud-based computing power so researchers don‚Äôt have to worry about building local resource intensive clinical machine-learning infrastructure. </span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Building a Research Ecosystem</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>The idea is to create an entire ecosystem for AI medical research, and not just for analyzing images. With the right datasets, people will also be able to explore important clinical use cases beyond the pixel data alone, including other related companion multimodal data.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The center already has nine datasets containing more than 1 million images, and Lungren predicts that number will double within the next year. Two new datasets will be released with the new platform. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>‚ÄúThis platform will have the largest diversity and volume of AI-ready medical datasets in the world,‚Äù he says. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In time, the platform will also offer standardized machine-learning tools and pre-trained models leveraging open-source data and common architectures ‚Äî AI software in a box, as it were ‚Äî to spur a wave of crowd-sourced AI research. </span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Democratizing the Tools</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>By offering data at no cost, researchers will be able to explore niche areas, such as medical problems that affect particular communities, that large corporations might well overlook. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>These diverse datasets will also make it easier for researchers to spot hidden biases in the data or in algorithms. Studies have shown that some AI models are more accurate for certain population groups than others, mainly because they were trained on data from patients at one location. Having datasets from many different communities will make it easier for researchers to detect those issues.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>‚ÄúWe love that corporations are doing all this work, but we don‚Äôt love the fact that the opportunity to share information is asymmetric,‚Äù Lungren says. ‚ÄúIf they amass data but then lock it down, they will be the only ones who can innovate, which would shut out the important contributions by computer scientists and clinicians around the world. That‚Äôs not a position we want to be in.‚Äù</span></span></span></p>

  <div>
    <p>A few people have asked me lately what makes for a good podcast.¬† Since my podcast is far from the most popular, and since most podcasts are not like mine, and do not (and should not) try to be like mine, perhaps I am not the right respondent.¬† Nonetheless I offered a simple formula:</p>
<p><em>A podcast really works when it is the dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>Or expressed in other words:</p>
<p><em>What makes for a good podcast is the dramatic tension between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>If you think of Russ Roberts at EconTalk, often ‚Äúthe story line‚Äù is something like ‚ÄúI am a Mensch and you are a Mensch, and we are going to talk this through together.‚Äù¬† In earlier times, it had more elements of ‚Äúyou are going to put forward some mainstream points, and I am going to push back with market-oriented economics.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many of the most famous podcasts are variants of: ‚ÄúWe will pretend to be talking about something, but in fact we will exploring new visions of masculinity for a Woke and post-Woke world.‚Äù</p>
<p>The visual images and home pages associated with those podcasts are often so‚Ä¶manly.¬† The T-shirts!¬† The muscles!¬† It is also why those podcasts fail so badly at having significant numbers of interesting female guests, addressed on their own terms.</p>
<p>Many episodes of Conversations of Tyler are ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to try to show people just how smart you are, but it will end up a wilder and more precarious ride than you might have thought.‚Äù¬† Occasionally a guest flunks the test (though they might still be smart).¬† Alternately, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/daniel-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the podcast with Daniel Carpenter</a> was the first episode of ‚ÄúTyler gets upset at a guest, they really have at it!‚Äù</p>
<p>I called my podcast with David Deutsch ‚Äúweird and testy‚Äù ‚Äî that too is dramatic tension.¬† One listener <a href="https://twitter.com/jachaseyoung/status/1400254407191580672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>: ‚ÄúTyler‚Äôs delight at having a guest who doesn‚Äôt hedge or mealymouth is palpable.‚Äù¬† Few tweeted about the substance of the disagreements.</p>
<p>One woman <a href="https://twitter.com/pupu_tintin/status/1400154143092789252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about it</a>: ‚ÄúWithout understanding everything he said, I find myself mentally stimulated &amp; spiritually inspired. Such a purist, an idealist, a truth-seeker w/ religious zeal. Not religious myself, I could see myself eventually submit to his religion‚Äù</p>
<p>She meant Deutsch.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1413829597918121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some listeners</a> enjoy how the guests are surprised and delighted by the questions.¬† With <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alexander-the-grate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander the Grate</a> ‚Äî the homeless guy ‚Äî the question was how he would perform at all.¬† I thought he was excellent and very interesting, but there was real suspense leading up to that point.¬† ‚ÄúAnd will Tyler question him just like he does everyone else?‚Äù</p>
<p>Get the picture?¬† I‚Äôm not saying these listeners are indifferent to the content, rather they filter it through the unfolding story about the dialogical interaction.¬† I don‚Äôt know of any successful podcasts that violate this principle.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶some very few podcasts are high level professionals in the same field, with a lot of respect for one another, exploring the space and enjoying each other‚Äôs company, especially when effectively ‚Äúmeeting for the first time.‚Äù I feel like this is maybe on the order of 1-5% of podcasts I hear. Most podcasts I listen to are ‚Äújust‚Äù very high quality interviews</p></blockquote>
<p>My podcasts with Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss would be examples of that, and there are plenty more out there without yours truly.</p>
<p>So, to use <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansonian rhetoric,</a> ‚ÄúPodcasting isn‚Äôt about the podcast!‚Äù¬† If you are seeking to understanding a podcast, including your own, start by asking what the basic story line is.¬† Where the dramatic tension lies.¬† Do you have enough dramatic tension in what you are doing?¬† What is the actual reason why you are not attracting more quality guests of a particular kind?</p>
<p>I am not claiming comparable expertise, but to return to my own endeavors, they are most influenced by: Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus (especially the interview segments, which maintain remarkable dramatic tension), Seinfeld (wonderful ensemble work), Curb Your Enthusiasm (for how long can you keep people on edge?), and the TNT halftime show with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, etc. (what makes for a dramatic or memorable interjection?).¬† I doubt those are the right sources for <em>your</em> podcast, but perhaps you should look far and wide as well, rather than just listening to other podcasts.¬† Howard Stern is perhaps another useful source?</p>
<p>If they had had another season of Seinfeld, would Jerry have to have started (again) dating Elaine?¬† The dramatic stories in a podcast also need to change and evolve over time, and perhaps I will return to that topic in the future.</p>

</figure><p>Intensive agriculture is a multifactorial source of stress on pollinator populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Pollinating insects, such as bees, face the physiological challenge of acute or chronic harm from exposure to various agrochemicals, including fungicides and pesticides, that are used to protect crop plants. They also face nutritional stress arising from the lack of pollen- and nectar-providing wild flowers in large-scale, intensive crop monocultures<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>. Moreover, the industrial transport and use of managed high-density colonies of honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) for crop pollination can increase pollinator exposure to parasites or pathogens<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, and might result in disease spillover to wild pollinators<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>. Over the past decade, the lethal or sublethal effect of combinations of agrochemical, pathogenic or nutritional stressors on bees has been tested in many individual experiments<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter <i>et al</i>. advance this knowledge through a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of interactions between agrochemical, pathogenic and nutritional stressors on multiple aspects of bee health and fitness. Their analysis is notable because of the breadth of bee responses considered (for example, foraging behaviour, memory, mortality and colony reproduction), and for comparisons of the interactions of multiple classes of stressor (for example, agrochemical‚Äìparasite, parasite‚Äìnutrition, agrochemical‚Äìagrochemical and parasite‚Äìparasite interactions).</p><p>The authors conducted a monumental literature search that yielded almost 15,000 relevant individual studies. Siviter and colleagues combed through these publications to focus on the experiments that investigated the combined effect of parasites (microorganisms and invertebrates), agrochemicals and nutritional stressors on bee health. The authors selected studies that used a balanced and replicated experimental design, and that provided accessible data (means, standard deviations and sample sizes) for each treatment. This rigorous focus and quality control resulted in a final set of 90 studies being selected for further analysis.</p><p>These studies provide a total of 356 effect sizes (measurements indicating the magnitude of a relationship between factors of interest and a particular outcome) for different stressor and bee-response combinations. The authors accounted for data issues that might have confounded their accurate detection of bee responses. Such challenges included those arising from statistical non-independence of multiple effects reported from a single study, publication biases (for example, the lack of negative results), species skews (honey bee data sets predominated), and how experimental treatments such as pesticide dose compare with what might be realistically encountered in the field (termed field realism).</p><p>Siviter and colleagues tested whether the stressor interactions were synergistic, meaning that their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects, as would be the case if the effect of one stressor on a bee elevates the effect of another stressor. The authors also examined alternative scenarios in which the effects of multiple stressors were antagonistic (the effect of one stressor lessens the effect of another) or additive (the combined effect is equivalent to the sum of the individual effects).</p><p>A consistent message from their analysis is that bee mortality is increased by a synergistic interaction between multiple stressors ‚Äî the worst-case scenario, indicating a disproportionate effect of multiple stressors on bee survival. Interactions between different agrochemicals, rather than other stressors, drove this overall effect, and this finding held true when accounting for the field realism of the agrochemical doses. This result confirms that the cocktail of agrochemicals that bees encounter in an intensively farmed environment can create a risk to bee populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">14</a></sup>. Multi-stressor interactions involving parasites and nutritional stress (including in combination with agrochemicals) produced additive effects on bee mortality overall.</p><p>The authors‚Äô deeper analysis of the biological complexity, however, revealed large differences between particular parasite groups in terms of the full range of additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects on bee mortality, when considering interactions between different parasites or between different parasites and nutritional stress. This variability in response, together with the lower sample sizes for the interactions involving stressors other than agrochemicals, indicate a caveat to consider and also suggest a need for more research on the combined effects of biological sources of stress.</p><p>It is intriguing that Siviter and colleagues found that additive, not synergistic, effects predominated for the non-lethal effects of stressors on fitness proxies (such as modifications of bee behaviour or reproduction, changes in parasite load or immune function). Such non-lethal changes could ultimately affect bee mortality rates. Consequently, how the observed synergistic effects of agrochemicals on bee mortality arise remains to be established. More work is therefore needed to identify the mechanism that links exposure to behavioural or physiological changes and mortality.</p><p>The majority of the studies in the data set were of managed populations of <i>A. mellifera</i>, so the authors also separately analysed responses at the level of bee genus (<i>Apis</i>, <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Megachile</i> and <i>Osmia</i>). <i>Apis</i> mortality was affected by a synergistic multi-stressor interaction qualitatively similar to the full analysis of all bee genera. Other bee genera exhibited additive or antagonistic mortality responses from many fewer studies. This raises an important point. There is a need for research efforts and regulators to widen their focus from <i>A. mellifera</i> ‚Äî a single, mostly managed bee species ‚Äî to other pollinator model organisms, whose different ecology and evolutionary history might result in different responses to stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter and colleagues‚Äô findings of the cumulative negative effect of multi-stressor interactions on bees reinforces the call to evaluate such interactions to avoid unforeseen risks to biodiversity and healthy ecosystems<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. In some regions of the world, regulatory risk-assessment frameworks for plant-protection products are being developed to deal with sublethal, long-term and potentially synergistic effects among stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR15" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">15</a></sup> (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track-category="body text link">go.nature.com/3f4ax5r</a>), but their biological and geographical scope must be extended. The authors acknowledge that the high levels of variability between the studies and parameters investigated demand an appropriately cautious interpretation. However, this highlights the need for worldwide reconsideration of risk-assessment approaches for pesticide regulation.</p><p>Given the widespread loss of habitat resources ‚Äî such as pollen and nectar sources ‚Äî from intensively managed agricultural landscapes<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>, nutritional deficits occurred surprisingly infrequently as a mechanism underlying bees‚Äô physiological stress (they accounted for only 58 out of the 365 measurements of effect sizes). A greater consideration of how nutritional stress interacts with exposure to pathogens and agrochemicals is therefore an obvious research gap to fill. Moreover, ensuring that experimental treatments are calibrated to simulate realistic environmental conditions would greatly aid risk assessments. This might include three-way combinations of field-realistic chemical doses and parasite levels, and a spatio-temporal dietary diversity similar to that found in semi-natural or highly human-modified landscapes.</p><p>The next challenge is to look beyond these parasite‚Äìnutrition‚Äìagrochemical interactions to consider other risks to pollination. Future studies must ultimately consider, through a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, the interplay of nutrition‚Äìpathogen‚Äìagrochemical interactions alongside the effects of other human-driven changes (such as climate change, pollution, land-use changes and the spread of invasive species)<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Although such assessments would be non-trivial to carry out, they will be vital for understanding and ranking the relative risks to pollinators and pollination that are coming from multiple combinations of pressures resulting from global changes.</p>
