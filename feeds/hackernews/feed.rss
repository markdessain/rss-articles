      <title>Launch HN: BlackOakTV (YC S21) – Netflix for black people</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28087309</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN! We are Uzo and Iyanu, the founders of BlackOakTV (<a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv</a>). BlackOakTV is a subscription video platform serving black audiences by making it easy for them to watch TV shows and movies that feature black stories and characters.<p>Nearly three-quarters of Black people want to watch more content that portrays their lives and experiences (Target Market News, 2018), but they can&#39;t find enough of it, and when they do find it, it usually hasn&#39;t gotten the budget or development resources that more mainstream content does.</p><p>When I grew up in the 90s, it seemed like black people had a relatively high number of TV shows to choose from like &#34;Martin&#34;, &#34;Living Single,&#34; and &#34;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&#34;. It felt good. I felt represented. Unfortunately, it turns out the 90s were an aberration, and over the next 2 decades, black content would become widely underrepresented in Hollywood. Having watched too much TV as a kid, I foolishly decided to get into media as an adult. I worked as a journalist, producer, media strategist and executive, loving to make content, but always being reminded that my culture wasn’t getting the representation it deserved, and always hoping to do something about that someday.</p><p>When I started at YouTube and Google, I thought I would finally be able to help change that; I thought the internet and the world&#39;s biggest video source would bring black people the same awesome experience they were creating for other viewers and creators. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. Black millennial users of YouTube, despite using it more than any other millennial group, often expressed that the comments on YouTube could make it an uncomfortable place. And black creators often did not get the same chance at success that their mainstream counterparts did, leading to some black creators filing lawsuits against YouTube. Despite YouTube&#39;s good intentions, systemic biases in how non-black users treated black creators, as well as the economic realities of Black people only representing 10% of the U.S. audience, have led to YouTube never doing quite enough to address this.</p><p>So I left YouTube, and Iyanu and I decided to address this on our own. The creator economy is booming, with black influencers among the most creative, and black consumers often among the most energetic and prolific users. I knew that energy could be harvested into a platform that gave black viewers the content they want, and creators the chance to make it. So we started BlackOakTV with the goal of delivering the most, and the best, Black content possible.</p><p>We license content from indie creators and make it available in one place, so Black viewers have a one-stop shop for the content they want to see. We&#39;re also creating/commissioning original content, to raise the bar on quality. We&#39;re different from Netflix in that our focus on black content means we can identify new black voices earlier, make it easier to find black content on our platform (hint: it’s everywhere!), and better serve the diversity of black viewers rather than just treating Black people as one single niche. As for the other streaming services targeting black users, our main differentiator from them will eventually be our product. Iyanu is an amazing engineer, and with his prowess, our product will provide a unique viewing experience, full of the features black viewers want.</p><p>But Netflix’s business model is where we aim to be a lot like them. Because Netflix changed media not just because of how they made their content available, but because for the first time in TV history, the aggregator of the content owned a direct relationship with the end user--and that’s why streaming is so valuable. And it’s why we want to have a product that makes users want to view our content exclusively through our properties. Today, users can go to blackoak.tv or download one of our apps, and after subscribing to our 7-day free trial, they can watch all of our content, on-demand, simply by scrolling through our catalog of shows and films. And because we appreciate the HN community taking time to hear our story, for a short period of time, we’re making some of our original black TV shows available for free on our site and in our apps on iOS, Android, Roku and Amazon Firestick. You don’t even have to sign up, just find the &#34;free section&#34; on our homepage or click the following link: <a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes</a>.</p><p>With that, I welcome any feedback, ideas, or experiences similar to ours. It’s been very challenging trying to enter a quickly maturing business with a lot of competition from public companies, and while we think we have some of the answers, your suggestions, thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated!</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <section>
      <p>~4.5 years ago I bought Dell XPS 15. It was a powerhorse without a match for that size/price.</p>
<p>I must admit that I wasn&#39;t happy about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcam is positioned below the screen, recording my typing fingers instead of my face.</li>
<li>Battery getting swollen (and being forced to fly that way wasn&#39;t fun), after replacing it happened again.</li>
<li>The CPU fan is loud and throttles a lot.</li>
<li>There&#39;s only one company in Slovenia that does warranty repairs and takes the law-specified 40 working days to finish their job (replacing a battery, for example).</li>
<li>Too heavy (over 2kg)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to go back to Thinkpads, as they are unmatched by the overall experience and quality to run Linux.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://bgamari.github.io/posts/2020-08-22-what-i-want-in-a-laptop.html">Ben Gamari&#39;s post</a>, I&#39;ve figured out I have the following requirements for the new laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bright screen (400 nits or possibly more), so I can work outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high-resolution screen (UHD), so that I can reasonably split the screen vertically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14&#34; or 15&#34; screen, I&#39;ve still not made up my mind but both of these work well for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light-weight (less than 2kg) so that I can travel light (and hold the laptop with one hand if I have to move a few meters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32 GB of RAM, so that I don&#39;t have to worry about hitting the limit (I don&#39;t even configure swap these days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrete GPU, to make it less convenient to play video games and there&#39;s less power drain from the battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiet fans, I haven&#39;t bothered with this before. XPS was really loud and I&#39;m getting older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best CPU possible, as I&#39;m <a href="https://cachix.org">frequently compiling Haskell</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good battery life (ideally 8h or more), so that I can do my day of work without worrying about a plug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast repair turnaround, I get that with Lenovo in Slovenia with about a day (if they have spare parts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 2 years of warranty, possibly 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thinkpad-p14s">Thinkpad P14s</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve bought a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/coming-soon/P14s-AMD-G2/p/22WSP144SA2">Thinkpad P14s</a>:</p>

<p>CPU benchmarks claim I&#39;m going from <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7700HQ+%40+2.80GHz&amp;id=2906">6945</a> to 
<a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+PRO+5850U&amp;id=4198">19504</a> CPU marks (for comparison, Apple M1 has 15139). Quite impressive!</p>
<p>After a few days of using it, it&#39;s noticeable faster.</p>
<p>Even with the fan at 4500 RPM, it&#39;s completely quiet.</p>
<p>Overall it meets all my requirements except for the battery (while I haven&#39;t tested it, I expect it to last below 8h).</p>
<p>Having a German keyboard is a price I pay for the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_global_chip_shortage">chip shortage</a>,
as it&#39;s hard to get a hold of P14s model with US/UK keyboard (also Brexit). Is there some kind of keys replacements service?</p>
<h3 id="nixos-setup">NixOS Setup</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/42127">NixOS doesn&#39;t yet support Secure Boot</a>, the first thing you need to do is boot into BIOS and disable it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/building-bootable-iso-image">Building bootable ISO image tutorial</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/lenovo/thinkpad/p14s/amd/gen2/default.nix">nixos-hardware support for Thinkad P14s</a> to be able to boot with an ISO
image that has wifi card support.</p>
<p>Installation of NixOS is almost identical to official instructions with <a href="https://gist.github.com/domenkozar/c1da433406807255f9aa835d72976470">a twist of encrypted root partition</a>.</p>
<p>Wifi works (<a href="https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89/issues/30">although there are issues with speed</a>), Bluetooth works, brightness control works, webcam works, trackpad works, suspend works.</p>
<p>Happy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wavefront rendering, see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2013-07_Megakernels-Considered-Harmful/laine2013hpg_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Laine et al. 2013</a></li>
<li>Multiple BVH types
<ul>
<li>Standard binary <em>SAH-based BVH</em></li>
<li><em>SBVH</em> (Spatial BVH), see <a href="https://www.nvidia.in/docs/IO/77714/sbvh.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stich et al. 2009</a>. This BVH is able to split across triangles.</li>
<li><em>QBVH</em> (Quaternary BVH). The QBVH is a four-way BVH that is constructed by iteratively collapsing the Nodes of a binary BVH. The collapsing procedure was implemented as described in <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/multi_rt08.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wald et al. 2008</a>.</li>
<li><em>CWBVH</em> (Compressed Wide BVH), see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/ylitie2017hpg-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ylitie et al. 2017</a>. Eight-way BVH that is constructed by collapsing a binary BVH. Each BVH Node is compressed so that it takes up only 80 bytes per node. The implementation incudes the Dynamic Fetch Heurisic as well as Triangle Postponing (see paper). The CWBVH outperforms all other BVH types.</li>
<li>BVH Optimization. The SAH cost of binary BVH&#39;s can be optimized using a method by <a href="https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/15603/2013-Fast-Insertion-Based-Optimization-of-Bounding-Volume-Hierarchies.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bittner et al. 2012</a>.</li>
<li>All BVH types use Dynamic Ray Fetching to reduce divergence among threads, see <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/76976/HPG2009-Trace-Efficiency.pdf" rel="nofollow">Aila et al. 2009</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two Level Acceleration Structures
<ul>
<li>BVH&#39;s are split into two parts, at the world level (TLAS) and at the model level (BLAS). This allows dynamic scenes with moving Meshes as well as Mesh instancing where multiple meshes with different transforms share the same underlying triangle/BVH data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>SVGF</em> (Spatio-Temporal Variance Guided Filter), see <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/publications/2017/svgf/svgf_preprint.pdf" rel="nofollow">Schied et al</a>. Denoising filter that allows for noise-free images at interactive framerates. Also includes a TAA pass.</li>
<li>Importance Sampling
<ul>
<li><em>Next Event Estimation</em> (NEE): Shadow rays are explicitly aimed at light sources to reduce variance.</li>
<li><em>Multiple Importance Sampling</em> (MIS): Explicit light sampling (NEE) is combined with standard BRDF sampling using MIS to get the best of both.</li>
<li>Cosine weighted direction sampling for diffuse bounces.</li>
<li>Microfacet sampling as described in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf" rel="nofollow">Walter et al. 2007</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Mipmapping</em>: Textures are sampled using mipmapping. Mipmap sampling is done using ray cones (see <a href="http://www.jcgt.org/published/0010/01/01/" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2012</a>, <a href="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/ea/seed/presentations/2019-ray-tracing-gems-chapter-20-akenine-moller-et-al.pdf" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2019</a>). Primary rays perform anisotropic sampling, subsequent bounces use isotropic sampling.</li>
<li><em>Blue Noise Sampling</em>: The low discrepency sampler by <a href="https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/762-2/" rel="nofollow">Heitz et al. 2019</a> is used. This sampler distributes Monte Carlo errors as a blue noise in screen space.</li>
<li>Hot Reloading: When F5 is pressed the CUDA module is destroyed, recompiled, and reloaded.</li>
<li>Multiple Material types
<ul>
<li><em>Diffuse</em></li>
<li><em>Dielectrics</em></li>
<li><em>Microfacets</em> (GGX)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitsuba XML Scene support: A custom Mitsuba XML parser is included to load scene files.</li>

      <title>Tools to Run Kubernetes Locally</title>
      <link>https://yankee.dev/6-tools-to-run-kubernetes-locally</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><p></p><p></p></div><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628148249210/-JvsBHAz6.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp"/><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss<!-- --> <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Kubernetes is a big and complicated technology and it clearly requires some time and dedication to wrap your head around. There is no vendor lock-in meaning it runs the same no matter which managed cloud platform you use it on. This means using it locally will be no different from using it on the cloud.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools for running Kubernetes on your local machine, but it basically boils down to two approaches on how it is done: </p>
<ol>
<li>running it from a single binary package </li>
<li>running it as a container using Docker in Docker (DinD)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="kubernetes-marketplace">Kubernetes Marketplace</h3>

<p>Before we move on to talk about all the tools, it will be beneficial if you installed <code>arkade</code> on your machine. It will help you get these tools with a single command. </p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="features">Features?</h2>
<p>All of the tools listed here more or less offer the same feature, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Multi-Node cluster</li>
<li>Persistent volumes </li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Certificates</li>
<li>Bare-metal support</li>
<li>Dashboard </li>
<li>Kubernetes Versions</li>
<li>Add-ons</li>
<li>Cross-platform</li>
<li>Tracks upstream Kubernetes</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="single-package-binary">Single package binary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s">k3s</a> </strong>
</p>
<p>k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution from Rancher Labs. It is specifically targeted for running on IoT and Edge devices, meaning it is a perfect candidate for your Raspberry Pi or a virtual machine. </p>
<p>It comes with a single binary of mere &lt;40 MB and takes as low as 500 MB of RAM.  </p>
<p>You can bootstrap k3s quickly using  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup">k3sup</a> !</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3sup
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s">k0s</a> </strong>

k0s is the latest entry on the block. By name, you might think it&#39;s a more stripped version of k3s, but it&#39;s an entirely different distribution from an entirely different company, called Mirantis. Contrary to the name, it comes in a larger binary of 150 MB+.</p>
<p>It can be run as a binary or in DinD mode. k0s takes security seriously and out of the box, it meets the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/definitions/what-does-mean-fips-compliant/">FIPS compliance</a>.  Although, a new distribution, k0s has reached the production-ready status, so there wouldn&#39;t be an issue for development usage. </p>
<pre><code>arkade get k0s
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s">Microk8s</a> </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  MicroK8s is a Kubernetes distribution by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. You already saw this coming; it can only be installed using <code>snap</code>.  It comes with loads of add-ons baked in like Fluentd, Grafana and Prometheus. </p>
<p>If you are on Ubuntu or its derivatives that uses <code>snap</code> you&#39;ll feel right at home using MicroK8s.</p>
<pre><code>  sudo snap install microk8s --classic
</code></pre>
<h2 id="docker-in-docker-dind">Docker in Docker (DinD)</h2>
<p>Running Docker inside of Docker (Inception anyone?) is a popular way of bootstrapping Kubernetes. The isolating nature of Docker makes running a multi-node cluster a breeze on a single machine, and also ensures the running instance does not affect the machine itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the title suggests, you need to have Docker installed on your machine to go this route.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">minikube</a> </strong>

Despite running on top of Docker and similar container technologies, minikube is really flexible in how it operates and supports multiple virtualization drivers making it adaptable to different computing environments.  These include KVM2, Virtualbox, Podman, Hyperkit, Hyper-V and many more.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get minikube
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind">KinD</a></strong>

Kubernetes in Docker (KinD) is similar to minikube but it does not spawn VM&#39;s to run clusters and works only with Docker.  KinD for the most part has the least bells and whistles and offers an intuitive developer experience in getting started with Kubernetes in no time.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get kind
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d/">k3d</a> </strong>

k3d is basically running k3s inside of Docker. It provides an instant benefit over using k3s on a local machine, that is, multi-node clusters. Running inside Docker, we can easily spawn multiple instances of our k3s Nodes.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3d
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Either you choose a single binary package or DinD approach, Kubernetes has made itself pretty accessible. For new learners, the barrier to entry is low, and the feedback loop is instantaneous. </p>
<p>I hope this article has been helpful in deciding which tool to use for running your local Kubernetes instance.</p>

      <title>Reflections on 10k Hours of Programming</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours — Malcolm Gladwell in Outsiders</blockquote><p>Well, I&#39;m certainly not a world-class expert, but I have put my 10,000 hours of deliberate practice into programming. Here are 31 of my reflections on programming.</p><p>These are reflections only about <strong>pure coding</strong> — no lessons sum up to &#34;programming is about people&#34; or &#34;how to be a senior technical leader&#34; (arguably more important to a career, but not the topic of this post).<em> </em></p><p><em>These reflections are just about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours</em>. Most don&#39;t apply to beginners. These reflections are not career advice. Think of them as lessons on being a technical guitarist, not about being a good band member. They are about becoming a better programmer for yourself.</p><ol><li>Browsing the source is almost always faster than finding an answer on StackOverflow.</li><li>In many cases, what you&#39;re working on doesn&#39;t have an answer on the internet. That usually means the problem is hard or important, or both.</li><li>Delete as much code as you can.</li><li>Syntactic sugar is usually bad.</li><li>Simple is hard.</li><li>Have a wide variety of tools and know which ones to use for the job.</li><li>Know the internals of the most used ones like git and bash (I can get out of the most gnarly git rebase or merge).</li><li>Build your own tools for repeated workflows. There is nothing faster than using a tool you made yourself (see: <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/about/">software</a> I wrote).</li><li>Only learn from the best. So when I was learning Go, I read the standard library.</li><li>If it looks ugly, it is most likely a terrible mistake.</li><li>If you have to write a comment that isn&#39;t a docstring, it should probably be refactored. Every new line of comments increases this probability. </li><li>If you don&#39;t understand how your program runs in production, you don&#39;t understand the program itself. In my experience, the best engineers know how their program works in every environment.</li><li>The above rule applies to the build pipeline as well.</li><li>Use other people&#39;s code religiously.</li><li>Corollary: Most code out there is terrible. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to write a better version yourself.</li><li>A rough rule of thumb: never take a direct dependency on a small library that you could easily rewrite or a large library that should have been small.</li><li>Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.</li><li>Organizing your code into modules, packages, and functions is important. Knowing where API boundaries will materialize is an art.</li><li>Pick the most efficient tool most of the time, but also pick what you know. Is Arch Linux the most efficient operating system for the modern developer? For me, it is, but for most, probably not. Should you use acme? Only if you&#39;re Rob Pike.</li><li>Avoid cyclomatic complexity. Novice coders don&#39;t even know that they&#39;ve tangled the dependency graph until it&#39;s too late.</li><li>Avoid nesting conditionals deeply. Have common sense about your conditional tests and naming convention.</li><li>Name variables correctly. Again, an art.</li><li>While rare, sometimes it&#39;s a problem with the compiler. Otherwise, it&#39;s always DNS.</li><li>Use esoteric language features sparingly, but use them when you&#39;re supposed to, for that is the point.</li><li>Technology does not diffuse equally. For example, there is a lot that frontend developers could learn from low-level engineers (especially now that everything is compiled). Likewise, there are UX and usability features that JavaScript developers could teach cloud engineers.</li><li>As a result, different kinds of engineers look at the world differently.</li><li>Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others. I know because I&#39;ve been both a 10x programmer and a -1x programmer.</li><li>There&#39;s no correlation between being a 10x programmer and a 10x employee (maybe a negative one).</li><li>Good APIs are easy to use and hard to misuse.</li><li>The configuration cycle goes from hardcoded values to environment variables, to CLI flags, to a configuration file, to a templated configuration file, to a DSL, to a generic bash script, and back to hardcoded values. Know where you are on this <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/heptagon-of-configuration/">Heptagon of Configuration</a>.</li><li>All layers of abstraction are malleable. If you run into a fundamental wall, sometimes the answer is to go down a layer of abstraction. You aren&#39;t confined to the surface.</li></ol><p><strong>Where did I put in my 10,000 hours?</strong> Well, I&#39;ve been programming for about 15 years. Most recently, I worked as a professional software engineer at Google on Kubernetes and Blackstone, the private equity firm. Before that, I spent most of college in the library writing programs for my own projects instead of writing proofs (which I should have been doing as a math major). And before that, I was hacking away at all sorts of things — <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/runescape-machine-learning/">running a botnet on RuneScape</a>, writing a Latin translation app for the iPhone (so I could do better on my Latin exams), <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/virgo-lang/">writing my own configuration language</a>, creating a web clipper, or <a href="https://eirenicon.org/2020/01/29/ricing-desktops/">ricing up my desktop</a>.</p><p><strong>What did I do for the 10,000 hours?</strong> The most recent work was in distributed systems, but I&#39;ve written code across the stack. Languages like PHP, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Swift. Frontend, backend, mobile, kernel, cloud, ops, and even some IT. I&#39;ve worked on large-scale open-source projects like Kubernetes and maintained subprojects, which allowed me to have my code peer-reviewed by some of the best engineers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Launch HN: Arengu (YC S21) – Frictionless Signup Flows</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28086676</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, we&#39;re Jacobo, Sergio &amp; Pablo, founders of Arengu (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>). We let you build cutting-edge signup flows as Airbnb, Stripe, or Slack for your SaaS, without dedicating a full engineering team.<p>Building an application requires coding boring flows like signup, logins, payments, and waiting lists. As applications grow, more complex flows are required, and most of the time they can only be edited by engineering teams. If something breaks, sometimes it takes time to notice. Measuring where users drop off can be tricky. Growth and marketing teams want autonomy to sign up users in landing pages, test new flows and get insights into what performs better.</p><p>At our previous jobs, we were constantly asked by clients to customize the signup, adding logic or integrations. We didn&#39;t find a good solution to cover the UI and custom logic with APIs other than coding from scratch. So we built a low-code platform, suitable for non-engineering teams, where you can build all the UI and integrations with a visual interface. Then you embed the flow in your site where you want it to appear with just a line of code.</p><p>Key features include: email or phone verification with OTPs; Stripe integration to enroll users in trial subscriptions; rate limiting to avoid spam or brute force attacks; approvals to build a waiting list and manually approve or reject signups; analytics events to track any user interaction with your flows; native integrations to send data back and forth between us and your apps; custom HTML/JS to extend your flows’ capabilities.</p><p>We make money based on the volume of submissions you have per month or based on product capabilities (eg. adding payment flows in your signup).</p><p>Watch our product intro video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo</a>) or if you scroll down our homepage (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>) to “Try a sign-up flow demo” you can see what the product looks like to the end-user and play around - it’s not to sign up to Arengu :P. There are more demos for every of the common use cases we have (<a href="https://www.arengu.com/use-cases" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com/use-cases</a>).</p><p>We would love to get feedback about your experience building signups flows: painful parts (eg. UI, logic, security, etc), complex flows (eg. KYC, OTPs, data verification, etc); anything you would like to share with us, or if you think we can help you, feel free to reach out at jacobo [at] arengu.com :)</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</p>
<p><a href="https://trogon.app/" rel="nofollow">https://trogon.app/</a> is a tool for learning to identify birds. You select a
location or region anywhere in the world on the map, and are taken to an
identification challenge (audio or visual) featuring bird species
occurring there.</p>
<p>By default the challenge is audio-only, but this can be changed in the
settings (<i></i> at the top of the page), along with
English vs scientific name preferences, etc.</p>

  </p><ol>
    <li>Zoom in on some area of the world.</li>
    <li>
      Right click / long press (phone) to load nearby

   <p>A couple of weeks ago, Edgar Dworsky walked into a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store in Somerville, Mass., like a detective entering a murder scene. </p>   <p>He stepped into the cereal aisle, where he hoped to find the smoking gun. He scanned the shelves. Oh no, he thought. He was too late. The store had already replaced old General Mills cereal boxes — such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs — with newer ones. It was as though the suspect&#39;s fingerprints had been wiped clean.</p>   <p>Then Dworsky headed toward the back of the store. Sure enough, old boxes of Cocoa Puffs and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios were stacked at the end of one of the aisles. He grabbed an old box of Cocoa Puffs and put it side by side with the new one. Aha! The tip he had received was right on the money. General Mills had downsized the contents of its &#34;family size&#34; boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces. </p>   <p>Dworsky went to the checkout aisle, and both boxes — gasp! — were the same price. It was an open-and-shut case: General Mills is yet another perpetrator of &#34;shrinkflation.&#34;</p>      <div id="res1012410291">

   <h3>Downsizing and shrinkflation mean the same thing</h3>   <p>Dworsky is a former Massachusetts assistant attorney general and longtime consumer advocate. He has spent decades tracking instances of companies shrinking products on his website <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432979f03f664d49dcc5e5c79f39a18dd28b4271efc31369b940439b84ef03106dbcaf749cb0c4b65cddf8ad9f5779632f">Mouseprint</a>. He refers to it by its original name, downsizing, but economist Pippa Malmgren rechristened it &#34;shrinkflation&#34; about a decade ago, and the term stuck. Downsizing and shrinkflation both refer to the same thing: companies reducing the size or quantity of their products while charging the same price or even more.</p>   <p>&#34;Downsizing is really a sneaky price increase,&#34; Dworsky says. &#34;Consumers tend to be price conscious. But they&#39;re not net-weight conscious. They can tell instantly if they&#39;re used to paying $2.99 for a carton of orange juice and that goes up to $3.19. But if the orange juice container goes from 64 ounces to 59 ounces, they&#39;re probably not going to notice.&#34;</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor&#39;s note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>&#39;s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>   <p>If consumers were the rational creatures depicted in classic economic theory, they would notice shrinkflation. They would keep their eyes on the price per Cocoa Puff and not fall for gimmicks in how companies package those Cocoa Puffs. A <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431bda99a81a3e11ccaa9d0a3100c38f5fce925be8af2571a53314c2a5241140d144dd2a80d4a3d73f92a9c5ce53a3b7a8">study</a> by John T. Gourville and Jonathan J. Koehler analyzed data from the market for cereal and other sectors and found that consumers are much more gullible than classic theory predicts. They are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity. Companies, of course, have known this for years.</p>      <h3>The case of the shrinking toilet paper roll</h3>   <p>Back in the day, Dworsky says, he remembers buying bigger candy bars and bigger rolls of toilet paper. The original Charmin roll of toilet paper, he says, had <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074380bdb227e78c01698090ddf0cd7729dde6a63e0f63ec19f02c2726185ba8f8ef8871b7fe92c8264edb806abb7712740b">650 sheets</a>. Now you have to pay extra for &#34;Mega Rolls&#34; and &#34;Super Mega Rolls&#34; — and even those have many fewer sheets than the original. To add insult to injury, Charmin recently <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507436430d5921dd0eb3903b2624508e06d573d78c79c31a38a42d205f2db8be79b17c97dce8733c2adb9a32af3dadb13b309">shrank the size</a> of their toilet sheets. Talk about a crappy deal.</p>   <p>Shrinkflation, or downsizing, is probably as old as mass consumerism. Over the years, Dworsky has documented the downsizing of everything from Doritos to baby shampoo to ranch dressing. &#34;The downsizing tends to happen when manufacturers face some type of pricing pressure,&#34; he says. For example, if the price of gasoline or grain goes up.</p>   <p>That is why, when the government began reporting surges in inflation several months ago, Dworsky was on the lookout for its devious, shrinkifying cousin. We&#39;re now seeing a wave of shrinkflation, from <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb0650743229b1d1113e35515b00072bd3d30004d4181b17d3a73d24aa2e22b551c0ae1af34db14311eacdaa89aed18e52aa23e71">Tillamook ice cream</a> to <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431e1f4f0280b3498124614ee117ed5303c3e2d79c0d7bd2e407ce14d19838c96f8dfeffe564bee25d18866e5c810739bb">Royal Canin cat food</a>. &#34;As we&#39;re seeing inflation picking up now, that&#39;s why I think you&#39;re going to see more items being downsized,&#34; Dworksy says. &#34;And maybe it&#39;s going to be a double-whammy: We&#39;re going to see some products going up in price at the same time that you&#39;re actually getting less in the package.&#34;</p>   <h3>A taller cereal box does not always mean more cereal</h3>   <p>Not all consumers are oblivious to shrinkflation. </p>   <p>Jonathan Fitzer is a big fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, another cereal made by General Mills. A couple of weeks ago, he went to a local grocery store in Tampa, Fla., to re-up. But on the shelf were two different versions of the product. The old box was the same as always. The new box, however, was taller and skinnier. And it was adorned with a picture advertising <em>Space Jam</em>, a new movie reboot starring LeBron James. Fitzer might have been forgiven for assuming a taller cereal box meant more cereal. &#34;And then I looked at the bottom and I saw the numbers were off and I was like, &#39;oh, come on now. I&#39;m getting ripped off here,&#39;&#34; he says.</p>   <p>Fitzer follows the &#34;<a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432f2bfd26774ea4b8146bf3e8dc7c43362b5295f18affbd056a03bee12a66164047608564f148cf679ae136883c160bd5">r/shrinkflation</a>&#34; thread on Reddit, and he uploaded a picture of the two boxes on the site. &#34;That&#39;s crazy shrinkage,&#34; <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507433752e0d0d585ecb379c99c8ac2424c4748126cbe843d99df8fb7ac73e5b6ed765014ce44f31544a76d3abc304ed111b7">said one commenter</a>. Another had words for the makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch: &#34;Why ya being shady, yo?&#34;</p>   <div id="res1012410339">

   <p>Last week, <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432b19006ec32478bb0ef7e1247060a85e399c5a1c4cb8b79bef504ee8cb0910db43548194adaed454d041e5aebc72be01">General Mills announced</a> the rising cost of ingredients, packaging, labor, and trucking was forcing it to revamp its business. It said that it was taking &#34;pricing actions&#34; and other steps to grapple with this inflation. We reached out to General Mills about reports that it&#39;s downsizing its cereals as part of its strategy.</p>   <p>&#34;General Mills has been working to create consistency and standardization across our cereal products, making it easier for shoppers to distinguish between sizes on shelf. For consumers seeking the best price per ounce, the most value is normally in our larger boxes of cereal,&#34; says Kelsey Roemhildt, a General Mills spokesperson. &#34;This change also allows more efficient truck loading leading to fewer trucks on the road and fewer gallons of fuel used, which is important in both reducing global emissions as well as offsetting increased costs associated with inflation.&#34;</p>   <p>General Mills&#39; reframing of its shrinkflation seems to be pretty typical of Corporate America. Companies often sell downsizing as a way to help the environment, offer consumers more choice, or improve the quality of their products. When a spokesperson for Charmin, for example, was confronted by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074353590c90100e375352895576ae8d747bdf88b7848805445710e057dc19de67a4c2010405c4fb5d464678205f59a5ca49">reporters at WBUR</a> about shrinking the size of their toilet sheet squares, she suggested it was the result of &#34;innovations&#34; that allow consumers to, basically, wipe their butts more efficiently.</p>   <p>If this keeps up, maybe someday we&#39;ll all be living in a Lilliputian dystopia where we&#39;re forced to eat miniature candy bars, drink tiny drinks, and wipe our bottoms with teeny-tiny squares of paper. Or maybe consumers will start to notice and voice concern and the power of consumer demand will force companies to listen and right-size their products. Until then, our prayers are with the lovers of Cocoa Puffs.</p>   <p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter segment? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

      <title>SEC Charges Decentralized Finance Lender for Raising $30M</title>
      <link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>Case Is Agency’s First Involving Securities Using DeFi Technology</h2></p><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Aug. 6, 2021 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Florida men and their Cayman Islands company for unregistered sales of more than $30 million of securities using smart contracts and so-called “decentralized finance” (DeFi) technology, and for misleading investors concerning the operations and profitability of their business DeFi Money Market.   </p>

<p>According to the SEC’s order, Gregory Keough, Derek Acree, and their company Blockchain Credit Partners offered and sold securities in unregistered offerings through DeFi Money Market from February 2020 to February 2021. The order finds that they used smart contracts to sell two types of digital tokens: mTokens that could be purchased using specified digital assets and that paid 6.25 percent interest, and DMG “governance tokens” that purportedly gave holders certain voting rights, a share of excess profits, and the ability to profit from DMG governance token resales in the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the order, in offering and selling mTokens and DMG governance tokens, the respondents stated that DeFi Money Market could pay the interest and profits because it would use investor assets to buy “real world” assets that generated income, like car loans.  However, the order finds that after publicly unveiling DMM, the respondents realized that DeFi Money Market could not operate as promised because the price volatility of the digital assets used to purchase the tokens created risk that the income generated through income-generating assets would be insufficient to cover appreciation of investors’ principal.  The order finds that rather than notifying investors of this roadblock, the respondents misrepresented how the company was operating, including by falsely claiming that DeFi Money Market had bought car loans that they displayed on DeFi Money Market’s website.  While the respondents controlled another company that owned car loans, DeFi Money Market never acquired an ownership interest in any of those loans. Instead, the order finds that the respondents used personal funds and funds from the other company they controlled to make principal and interest payments for mToken redemptions. </p>

<p>“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws – no matter what technologies are used to offer and sell those securities,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “This allows investors to make informed decisions and prevents issuers from misleading the public about business operations.”</p>

<p>“The federal securities laws apply with equal force to age-old frauds wrapped in today’s latest technology,” said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. “Here, the labeling of the offering as decentralized and the securities as governance tokens did not hinder us from ensuring that DeFi Money Market was immediately shut down and that investors were paid back.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s order finds that the mTokens were notes and were also offered and sold as investment contracts, the DMG governance tokens were offered and sold as investment contracts, and the respondents violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by conducting unregistered offers and sales of both types of digital assets. The SEC’s order also finds that Respondents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</p>

<p>Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC’s order, respondents consented to a cease-and-desist order that includes disgorgement totaling $12,849,354 and penalties of $125,000 each for Keough and Acree. In addition, prior to the issuance of this order, the respondents funded the smart contracts so that mToken holders could redeem their mTokens and receive all principal and interest owed.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Brent Mitchell, Stephanie Reinhart, and Gregory Smolar and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Ana Petrovic of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit with assistance from trial counsel Kristin Murnahan and the Enforcement Division’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. </p>

<p>I just added half-precision floats to Futhark, as the type <code>f16</code>. This wasn’t particularly hard (perhaps a day of work), but it was <em>annoying</em> for fairly shallow technical reasons, so as a bit of catharsis, here’s a blog post about the challenges I encountered.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a href="#why" id="why-link" title="why">Why</a></h3>
<p>First of all, why do we even <em>want</em> 16-bit floats? Their precision is horrible and the largest representable value is a mere 65504. Apparently 16-bit floats were used by various exotic processors in the early 80s, but the modern lineage, as eventually standardised by IEEE 754-2008, hails from graphics programming. This is because half-precision floats can be useful for expressing light intensities, as they are <em>accurate enough</em>, while allowing much larger dynamic range than a 16-bit fixed point number. Initially, half-precision was only used as a storage format, but eventually GPUs grew support for operating directly on half-precision floats; often with twice the arithmetic throughput. Since they only take up half as much space in memory as single-precision floats (and hence also use half the memory bandwidth), they are in theory “twice as fast” as single-precision floats.</p>
<p>Half-precision floats have also become increasingly popular for use in machine learning applications, as it appears neural networks are resistant to numerical problems (presumably they just train around them). But this is where things get interesting: there are actually (at least) <em>two</em> half-precision float formats. All take up 16 bits in memory, but differ in how they allocate those bits to significand and exponent. The one we support in Futhark is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format#ARM_alternative_half-precision">the <em>binary16</em> format from IEEE 754-2008</a>, but Google has also developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format">bfloat16</a> for use in AI accelerators. ARM apparently also supports a nonstandard variation of binary16, but I’m hoping I will never have to learn the details.</p>
<p>So we want to support half-precision floats because some applications can make use of them, either because they take up less space or because computation on them is actually faster.</p>
<h3 id="how"><a href="#how" id="how-link" title="how">How</a></h3>
<p>Half-precision floats are standardised in IEEE 754-2008, but they are <em>not</em> a universally supported type in common programming languages. In particular, ISO C does not support them. Other languages have unusual restrictions where <code>half</code> is supported as a “storage type” (meaning you can put them in memory), but you need to convert them to some other type (e.g. <code>float</code>) if you actually want to do arithmetic on them. This is not how we want to do it in Futhark. The <code>f16</code> type should be fully supported like any other primitive type, and on all systems. When necessary, the compiler must generate code to paper over lack of hardware support.</p>
<h4 id="c"><a href="#c" id="c-link" title="c">C</a></h4>
<p>Most of Futhark’s backends generate C code - either plain CPU C, OpenCL C, or CUDA C. Let’s start with plain C, which does not support a <code>half</code> type. One option would be representing <code>f16</code> as a 16-bit integer and then implementing every single arithmetic operation manually. <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">People have done so</a>, but such code runs extremely slowly. Instead, we simply <code>typedef float f16</code> and actually perform the <code>f16</code> operations in single precision. However, we don’t want these simulated floats to take up 32 bits per element in memory, so we distinguish between the <em>scalar type</em> used for operations, which is <code>float</code>, and the <em>storage type</em> used for arrays, which is <code>uint16_t</code>. When reading an <code>f16</code> from an array, we must use a function to convert from the storage type to the scalar type - fortunately, the library linked above contained such a function and its inverse. This means that <code>f16</code> operations might produce different results depending on whether they are emulated or not, as emulation only performs the rounding at the end, while true <code>f16</code> calculations might also round intermediate results. I’m not sufficiently experienced with numerical analysis, or the guarantees of IEEE 754, to say whether this is a real problem.</p>
<p>We also have a problem with <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-09-26-calling-futhark-from-c-and-haskell.html">Futhark’s C API</a>. Normally an entry point that returns a scalar will be exposed as a C function that produces a value of the obvious type (<code>int32_t</code> for <code>i32</code> and so on), but C does not have a <code>half</code> type. Again we fall back to the notion of “storage type” and return <code>f16</code> results as <code>uint16_t</code>. Life would be so much easier if <code>half</code> was universally supported.</p>
<h4 id="opencl"><a href="#opencl" id="opencl-link" title="opencl">OpenCL</a></h4>
<p>Let’s move on to the OpenCL backend. Surely life is easier there! No, it never is. OpenCL <em>does</em> actually define a <code>half</code> type, but only as a storage format, meaning you can have pointers to them, but not perform any arithmetic, unless the platform in question supports the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/cl_khr_fp16.html"><code>cl_khr_fp16</code></a> extension (and you enable it). OpenCL platforms are loaded dynamically followed by run-time compilation at kernels, so the Futhark compiler does not know at compile-time whether the target platform supports half-precision. Therefore we generate <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/scalar_f16.h#L11-L34">kernel code with plenty of #ifdefs</a> to detect whether the platform supports <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, and fall back to <code>float</code>-based emulation otherwise. Remarkably, OpenCL <em>does</em> provide builtin functions for <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/vload_half.html">efficiently translating between single-precision and half-precision floats stored in memory</a>, even for those platforms that don’t have <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>. This lets us load half-precision floats into single-precision scalars at quite high speed. I noticed about an order of magnitude difference compared to the hand-written conversion function. This is quite important, since for some reason, NVIDIA’s OpenCL implementation does <em>not</em> support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, despite their GPUs being fully capable.</p>
<p>As a delightful quirk, the OpenCL emulator <a href="https://github.com/jrprice/Oclgrind">Oclgrind</a> claims to support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, but will fail to actually perform any operations on <code>half</code> values. Futhark users will never use Oclgrind, but it is an absolutely indispensable tool for hacking on the compiler, and is used in our regression test suite as well. The solution is an <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/master/rts/c/opencl.h#L739-L743">ad-hoc check to always emulate half-precision on Oclgrind</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cuda"><a href="#cuda" id="cuda-link" title="cuda">CUDA</a></h4>
<p>Okay, time for CUDA. NVIDIA has been marketing half-precision hard, so <em>surely</em> everything will just work out, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, CUDA does indeed support half-precision floats on devices that are Compute Capability 6.0 or newer. This can be checked with an <code>#ifdef</code>. However, for some strange reason, you have to include a special header file, <code>cuda_fp16.h</code>, to actually get access to the <code>half</code> type and its operations. Glancing at the header file, it looks like <code>half</code> is actually implemented as a C++ class with inline PTX (CUDA assembly) to perform the computations using the natively supported half-precision instructions. This is quite baroque. Why isn’t the <code>half</code> type just implemented in the compiler, like it is in OpenCL?</p>
<p>I <em>suspect</em> the reason is that CUDA is mostly a “single source” programming model where the same program contains both CPU and GPU code, where the CPU code is ultimately compiled with the system compiler - which does not support half-precision floats. In contrast, OpenCL C is specifically for “device” code (read: GPU code), and the “host” (CPU) is completely out of its purview. Futhark does not use CUDA in a “single source” manner, but instead uses <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html">NVRTC</a> to do run-time compilation of CUDA kernels, very similar to how OpenCL works.</p>
<p>The need to include <code>cuda_fp16.h</code> is not just a compiler implementation curiosity - it turns out to present the <em>greatest</em> annoyance in this entire cavalcade of accidental complexity. Apparently when you run-time compile a CUDA kernel with NVRTC, the default search path does not include the CUDA include directory, so <em>this header cannot be found</em>. Whoever calls the NVRTC API must explicitly provide the directory containing this header. This is <em>bad</em>. I’ve long sought to ensure Futhark didn’t <a href="https://gist.github.com/cookrn/4015437">contribute to the growing accidental complexity disaster</a>, with new configuration files and environment variables being my main aversion.</p>
<p>But now it seems we have no choice. Futhark <em>must</em> be able to figure out, at run-time, where CUDA is installed, and there is no standard for this. Sure, it’s often in <code>/usr/local/cuda</code>, but it’s fairly common to put it somewhere in <code>/opt</code> as well, especially on supercomputer systems. And there is <em>no standard environment variable</em> pointing at the CUDA directory! Other GPU applications respect any or all or <code>CUDA_HOME</code>, <code>CUDA_PATH</code>, and <code>CUDA_ROOT</code>. And, to my great regret, <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/cuda.h#L348-L358">now Futhark does as well</a>.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy and a shame. There is no good reason that is has to be this way. I <em>know</em> that this will result in things not working down the line, just because a user didn’t set an invisible global variable correctly. I still hope that I just missed a subtle detail somewhere, and that this will eventually go away like a bad dream.</p>

<p>Half-precision floats are the worst IEEE floats in all ways except speed. So are they faster in Futhark? Sort of. On an A100 GPU, the expression <code>f16.sum</code> can sum one billion half-precision floats in <em>2.1ms</em>, while <code>f32.sum</code> takes <em>2.9ms</em> to sum one billion single-precision floats. That’s a speedup of <em>1.38x</em>, which is much less than the <em>2x</em> we would theoretically expect. So what’s going wrong? Two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Adding two half-precision floats on their own is probably not faster than adding two single-precision floats. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF.html#group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF">CUDA’s half-precision API</a> strongly implies one should consider using <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC.html#group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC">the <code>half2</code> type</a>, which packs two half-precision numbers in 32 bits, and allows “vectorised” operations on both in a single instruction. As far as I understand current hardware, this is the way half-precision floats can achieve high arithmetic throughput. I don’t know if the CUDA compiler will optimise multiple <code>half</code>s into <code>half2</code>s on its own, but I doubt it - especially for a reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis above is valid, but it’s not actually what is happening here. This summation is <em>completely</em> bandwidth-bound, so the only thing that matters is how efficiently we access memory. In <code>f16.sum</code>, each thread reads a 16-bit value at a time. While the Futhark compiler arranges things so that the accesses are fully <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu/coalesced">coalesced</a>, the GPU’s memory architecture is not really designed for individual threads issuing such small reads - perhaps each thread will actually read (at least) 32 bits, then throw half of it away. In any case, the result is that the memory bus is not fully utilised.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A more efficient half-precision reduction would have each thread read multiple packed values with a single transaction, such as by reading a 32-bit <code>half2</code>. This is a trick we’ll have to teach the compiler at some point. This is also not a new concern - if you write a program that sums 8-bit or 16-bit integers, you are also not fully utilising the memory bus, even if in absolute runtime, it’s still faster than summing the same number of 32-bit integers.</p>
<p>How do we verify that this analysis is correct? We can write a program that interprets an array of <code>u32</code> values as packed <code>f16</code>s, using a <code>map</code>-<code>reduce</code> composition:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>map (\x -&gt; f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x&gt;&gt;<span>16</span>)) +</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>           f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x)))</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>&gt;-&gt; f16.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can sum the equivalent of a billion <code>f16</code>s (that is, half a billion <code>u32</code>s) in a mere <em>1.5ms</em> - a <em>1.93x</em> speedup over <code>f32</code> summation.</p>
<h3 id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats"><a href="#so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats" id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats-link" title="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats">So should you use single-precision floats?</a></h3>
<p>Unless you know what you are doing, you probably should not use <code>f16</code> in your code. Their numerical properties are absolutely going to bite you. Interoperability is awkward and the performance isn’t even that great <em>yet</em>. But from a language perspective they are now fully supported, and hopefully we’ll make them run even faster in a not too distant future. But I doubt we’ll add more bits, so the numerics are always going to be dubious.</p>

	<p>Postgres.app is a full-featured PostgreSQL installation packaged as a standard Mac app.
It includes everything you need to get started:
we’ve even included popular extensions like <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> for geo data and <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">plv8</a> for JavaScript.</p>

<p>Postgres.app has a beautiful user interface and a convenient menu bar item.
You never need to touch the command line to use it – but of course we do include all the necessary <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">command line tools</a> and header files for advanced users.</p>

<p>Postgres.app can install minor updates automatically, so you get bugfixes as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="installing-postgresapp">Installing Postgres.app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Download   ➜   Move to Applications folder   ➜   Double Click</p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t move Postgres.app to the Applications folder, you will see a warning about an unidentified developer and won&#39;t be able to open it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click &#34;Initialize&#34; to create a new server</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Configure your <tt>$PATH</tt> to use the included command line tools (optional):</p>
		<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &amp;&amp;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Done! You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with these default settings:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>Host</td>
		<td>localhost</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Port</td>
		<td>5432</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User</td>
		<td>your system user name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database</td>
		<td>same as user</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>none</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Connection URL</td>
		<td>postgresql://localhost</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To connect with psql, double click a database. To connect directly from the command line, type <code>psql</code>. If you’d rather use a graphical client, see below.</p>

<p>NOTE: These instructions assume that you’ve never installed PostgreSQL on your Mac before.
If you have previously installed PostgreSQL using homebrew, MacPorts, the EnterpriseDB installer, consider <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/remove.html">removing other PostgreSQL installations</a> first.
We also have <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/update.html">instructions for upgrading from older versions of Postgres.app</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphical-clients">Graphical Clients</h2>

<p>Postgres.app includes <code>psql</code>, a versatile command line client for PostgreSQL.
But it’s not the only option; there are plenty of great graphical clients available for PostgreSQL.
Two popular tools are:</p>

<ul>
	<li id="pgadmin"><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a></li>
	<li id="postico"><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a> is a feature rich open source PostgreSQL client.
It has support for almost every feature in PostgreSQL.
The only downside is that the cross-plattform UI really doesn’t live up to the expectations of a native Mac app.</p>

<p><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> on the other hand, is a very modern Mac app.
It’s made by the same people that maintain Postgres.app, and we think you’ll like it! 
We put a lot of effort into making it a joy to use.
However, it doesn’t have the extensive feature set of pgAdmin, and it’s a commercial app rather than open source.</p>

<p>Aside from those two options, there are a lot more to choose from! Check the documentation for a <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/gui-tools.html">list of amazing Mac apps for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-connect">How to connect</h2>

<p>After your PostgreSQL server is up and running, you’ll probably want to connect to it from your application.
Here’s how to connect to PostgreSQL from popular programming languages and frameworks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">PHP</dt>
	<dd>
			<p>
				To connect from PHP, make sure that it supports PostgreSQL.
				The version included with macOS doesn&#39;t support PostgreSQL.
				We recommend <a href="https://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for an easy way to install a current version of PHP that works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use PDO (object oriented):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$db = new PDO(&#39;pgsql:host=localhost&#39;);
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
$statement-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[&#34;datname&#34;]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				Or the <tt>pg_connect()</tt> functions (procedural):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$conn = pg_connect(&#34;host=localhost&#34;);
$result = pg_query($conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {

      <p>Joseph Allen runs a major public health research project at Harvard University, probing how indoor air quality affects human health and cognition. He consults with companies on ventilation and air filtration, and during the pandemic he became a prominent voice on public health, writing dozens of op-eds criticizing early guidance from health authorities and debunking misconceptions about how the virus spreads. But none of it would have happened if he hadn’t washed out as an FBI recruit.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City homicide detective who opened his own investigative agency, Allen spent his teens and 20s helping with the family business. He did surveillance, undercover work, computer forensics, and skiptrace—tracking down people who left town to avoid alimony. Eventually he took over the agency, leading investigations and supervising eight agents.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the work and thought it was challenging,” Allen recalls. But part of him always wanted to be a scientist. He majored in environmental science at Boston College, and in his late 20s, still torn, he began to apply to graduate school even as he started the process to become an FBI agent. After 2 years of interviews and testing, the last step was a routine polygraph test. He failed the first round—the trick questions he was asked were so obvious that he could not take them seriously. So FBI flew in one of its toughest examiners from Iraq—a hulking, jackbooted guy who got right in Allen’s face, screaming that he knew he was lying. But Allen kept cool, and after a while, the interrogator stormed out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>“I thought he would come back in the room and say, ‘Congratulations,’ cause I’m thinking I’m crushing it,” Allen recalls. “But they failed me because they said I employed countermeasures.” FBI apparently didn’t want an agent who couldn’t be unnerved by a polygraph test. And that solved Allen’s career dilemma. “I guarantee I’m the only public health student ever to fail an FBI lie detector polygraph in the morning and start graduate school a few hours later,” Allen says. But his investigative instincts never left him.</p>

<p>A tall, athletic-looking man with a bald head and stylish stubble, Allen directs the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he studies the effects of toxic gases emitted from furniture, carpets, and paints; stale air; and high levels of carbon dioxide. Years of studies by Allen and others have shown poorly circulated air in buildings impairs our ability to think clearly and creatively. Considering that we spend more than 90% of our lifetimes indoors, those findings have implications for personal well-being—and for businesses concerned about their bottom line.</p>

<p>“Joe has always had a unique understanding of this range of domains—from how buildings work, to environmental exposure assessment, to making connections with health outcomes,” says Brent Stephens, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “There’s not a tremendous number of people in this world that have worked on that whole spectrum.”</p>

<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, the previously esoteric field of indoor air quality suddenly became the focus of widespread concern. Like many of his colleagues, Allen jumped into the fray, advising school systems, police departments, entertainment companies, the Boston Symphony, and a host of other entities on how to make their indoor air healthier, during the pandemic and afterward.</p>

<p>“COVID really changed the conversation,” says Matt Murray, vice president of leasing at Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded developer in the United States and one of Allen’s consulting clients. Before the pandemic, the company would have to explain to bored executives why they should pay attention to indoor air. “Now, the CEOs are all saying, ‘What filters do you use? How you process the air you bring into the workspace?’” Murray says. “And we’re ready for those conversations because we’ve been working with Joe.”</p>

<p><span>After he failed</span> his FBI exam, Allen became a different kind of sleuth. For his doctoral thesis at the Boston University School of Public Health, he investigated toxic flame-retardant chemicals released into the air by furniture, and found they were nearly ubiquitous. (The chemicals were later banned.) After graduation he got a job with a consulting firm, where he investigated problems such as toxic emissions from drywall and outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, which is caused by bacteria that grow in plumbing and become aerosolized by ventilation systems, showers, or even flushed toilets. Those investigations introduced him to “sick building syndrome,” a problem first identified in the 1970s in which the occupants experience fatigue, itchy eyes, headaches, and other symptoms. Exactly what causes these ailments isn’t clear, but exposure to contaminated air is a likely culprit. Allen became convinced that the building you work in can have more impact on your health than your doctor.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>In 2014, Allen accepted a position at Harvard, where he soon turned his attention to how the indoor environment can affect people’s cognitive abilities. Many of us have struggled to pay attention during a long staff meeting in a stuffy conference room. Research by Allen and others suggests that lassitude may not be due solely to boredom, but also to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-rich conference room air.</p>

<p>Ever since the energy shocks of the 1970s, buildings in the United States have been made as airtight and energy-efficient as possible. The result was a buildup of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. “Green building standards” introduced in the late ’90s focused on reducing toxic materials and making buildings healthier as well as more sustainable, but they didn’t prioritize indoor air quality and ultimately did little to improve it.</p>

<p>In a multiyear series of experiments, Allen and his team have investigated the consequences. In the first study, published in 2015, they had 24 white-collar volunteers spend six working days in environmentally controlled office spaces at Syracuse University’s Total Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. On various days the experimenters would alter ventilation rates and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs. Each afternoon the volunteers were tested on their ability to think analytically and react to a crisis. (One test, for example put the volunteer in the role of a small-town mayor trying to react to an emergency.) All tests were double-blind: Neither the volunteers nor the study personnel knew that day’s environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The results were dramatic. When volunteers worked in well-ventilated conditions (which lowered the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs), they scored 61% higher than when they worked in typical office building conditions. When they worked in the cleanest conditions, with even lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels and higher ventilation rates, their scores climbed 101%.</p>

<p>To find out whether the results held up in the real world, Allen and his team recruited 109 volunteers from 10 office buildings across the United States. Six had been renovated to create better heat and humidity control, improve ventilation, and lower the use of toxic materials. Four had not. Allen’s team gave each office worker a Fitbit-like bracelet to record heart rate, skin temperature, sleep patterns, and other physiological signs of well-being. Workers also completed a survey each day about how comfortable they felt and whether they experienced symptoms such as drowsiness or headaches. At the end of the week, they took the cognitive tests. Workers in the buildings with good ventilation and lower levels of indoor pollution scored 26.4% higher than those in the unimproved buildings. They also reported sleeping better and experiencing fewer “sick building” symptoms.</p>

  <figcaption><p>Many sources of indoor air pollution can affect human health and cognition. These include particles and gases emitted by furniture and building materials, as well as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exhaled by a building’s occupants. Choosing better materials and improving ventilation, filtration, and air processing can help make buildings healthier.</p>

      <p>“This is really important, interesting work,” says Elliott Gall, an indoor air scientist at Portland State University. “It’s a great example of the kind of interdisciplinary work [that explores] the complexity of indoor air and how it affects us.”</p>

<p>Over time, Allen came to see businesspeople as natural allies who could act on his public health findings faster than government officials. He teamed up with John Macomber, a Harvard Business School lecturer and former CEO of one of the largest construction companies in New England. Macomber was impressed with Allen’s research suggesting a tiny sacrifice in energy efficiency through improved ventilation could increase a business’s bottom line by as much as 10% by decreasing absenteeism and boosting worker productivity. “I realized we’ve been missing the boat,” Macomber says. “We’re chasing pennies on energy when there’s thousands of dollars in productivity issues.”</p>

<p>Allen and Macomber consulted with companies and spoke at corporate conferences, making the economic case for improving ventilation and filtration as well as adjusting lighting, temperature, and humidity. “The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated,” they wrote in a book they co-authored, <em>Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity</em>. “There are just a handful of things we need to do to make a building healthier.”</p>

<p>Allen’s group continued to investigate how the indoor environment affects our mental state. They found that airline pilots exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> levels common in cockpits did worse on Federal Aviation Administration–mandated emergency response tests than when they breathed better air. They showed that during a heat wave, students who lived in non–air-conditioned dorms had slower reaction times and poorer problem-solving skills than those with air conditioning. They showed that bringing plants and views of nature into the workplace can lower office workers’ heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological indicators of stress.</p>

<p>In 2019, Allen’s team embarked on an ambitious international project to examine the long-term impacts of indoor air quality by tracking the physical and cognitive health of more than 300 office workers in 43 buildings in six countries over the course of 1 year. They mailed each worker a wristband to monitor their physiology and a small sensor to continuously measure levels of fine particulates and CO<sub>2</sub> in their workspace. At predetermined times and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and particulates, the program pinged each worker’s smartphone with a quiz to test reaction time and cognitive function. The studies showed that in offices across the world, poor ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub>, and particulates (which carry VOCs) conspire to significantly impair cognitive function.</p>

<p><span>When the first reports</span> of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Allen realized his years researching air quality and disease transmission in indoor environments had new relevance. “Even though the virus was novel, there are elements in all this that feel quite familiar,” he says. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a radiological hazard, biological hazard, or chemical hazard. We know how to assess the risk and put in appropriate controls.”</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) latched onto the idea that the virus was spread by large, exhaled droplets that float for a short time and then settle on surfaces. But scientists specializing in aerosols knew airborne viruses are more likely to ride on tinier particles exhaled when people breathe, sneeze, cough, or talk. Smaller than 5 microns, these particles can travel across a room and linger in indoor air for hours.</p>

<p>Aerosol experts such as Lidia Morawska of Australia’s Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point; Donald Milton of the University of Maryland, College Park; and Linsey Marr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the focus on larger droplets had led to wrong-headed guidance about washing packages with bleach, staying 2 meters apart—even outdoors—and other forms of what some researchers called “hygiene theater.” They urged policies that emphasized indoor mask wearing and less draconian regulations for people outdoors, where the virus would quickly disperse.</p>

<p>Allen signed on to that fight, collaborating with aerosol experts and public health researchers on scientific papers and bringing their case to the public. “He’s a really good public communicator,” says Marr, who credits Allen with helping her work get the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>“One of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on,” Allen says. “Even by late January 2020 we knew that airborne transmission of aerosols was not only likely, but probable.” Waiting for proof made no sense. “This was a pandemic, an all-in moment, so why wouldn’t we have immediately deployed every strategy that could have helped?” Those strategies, Allen knew from his research, include bringing more outside air into chronically underventilated buildings and using higher efficiency filters in ventilation units.</p>

      <p>He started waking up at 4 a.m. to write opinion pieces. His first two, in the <em>Financial Times </em>and <em>The New York Times</em>, argued that buildings, if properly ventilated, could be formidable weapons in the fight against the virus. He and his team had measured air flow in schoolrooms under various conditions, and Allen explained that schools could easily be made safe by opening windows and buying the kind of high-efficiency particulate air purifiers sold at local home stores.</p>

<p>So much of his writing involved correcting misimpressions that he felt he was playing editorial whack-a-mole. No, he argued, you do not have to wipe your groceries with bleach. No, you do not have to avoid exercising outside. No, schools do not need to install costly air-purifying systems.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Morawska and Milton wrote an open letter to WHO—a full-throated appeal to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission. Allen was among 237 other scientists in 32 countries who signed on to the letter, which urged greater emphasis on indoor air quality. But WHO continued to downplay the importance of aerosol transmission. “I think some of the reluctance was that if [health authorities] say a disease is airborne, we’d have to provide N95 masks for every health worker and have negative pressure rooms in every hospital, which wasn’t possible,” Marr says.</p>

<p>Later that month, Allen and his Harvard colleague Parham Azimi published a study in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>that used computer modeling to reconstruct the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak on the <em>Diamond Princess </em>cruise ship. By mapping the ship’s ventilation system and the locations of people who came down with the disease, they showed that only aerosols, not larger droplets, could have traveled the necessary distances through the ducts. Similar findings emerged from studies by Marr, Morawska, and others.</p>

<p>Finally, in early May, after a series of persuasive papers in major journals, WHO and CDC acknowledged that the virus was transmitted primarily by fine aerosols. (Even then, the agencies issued no major announcements but simply changed the wording on their websites.) Since then, CDC has gone further, issuing recommendations for reopening schools that stress the importance of good ventilation in addition to vaccinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen and his colleagues at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program created a website with a comprehensive guide to maintaining proper ventilation in schools, homes, and businesses. The website advises building managers to bring in as much outside air as possible—a room air exchange rate of four to six times per hour, more than double the rate in a typical office or school building. In buildings that recirculate interior air, managers should upgrade to hospital-grade MERV 13 filters, which remove up to 90% of particles 2.5 microns or smaller, rather than the typical MERV 8, which can remove as little as 20%.</p>

<p>The new focus on indoor air quality could help hasten the end of the current pandemic and perhaps even help forestall the next one. It may bring broader changes as well. Businesspeople are recognizing the value of improving indoor air to create better working conditions and add value to their properties. “What we’re seeing with some parts of the market—notably the higher end, real estate investment trusts, owners of multiple office buildings or apartments—is they’re thinking really hard about competing” in the post pandemic market, Macomber says. “And one way to compete is to have healthier buildings.”</p>

<p>Allen predicts that the new availability of cheap personal air quality monitors will quicken that competition and heighten people’s awareness of the indoor environment. Previously, the only way to assess indoor air quality was to hire an expensive consultant. Now, with monitors available online for less than a couple of hundred dollars, any office worker or hotel guest can quickly monitor CO<sub>2</sub>; some devices even detect VOCs. If consumers post results on websites like Yelp, businesses would be forced to pay attention. (Indeed, some building owners already boast about air quality in advertisements.)</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a fundamental rebalancing in terms of how we think about indoor spaces,” Allen says. “I think that people won’t tolerate sick buildings, where you feel tired, your eyes itch, you have a headache, or you’re stuffed into a closetlike office with no windows.” It’s one lasting positive from the pandemic. “That era is over,” Allen says. “Rightly so, and good riddance.”</p>

      <title>I compromised 300 stores and a “Spanish consultancy”</title>
      <link>https://edbrsk.dev/content/real-cases/how-I-compromised-300-stores-and-a-spanish-consultancy</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p></p>
<h2 id="part-1.-how-i-compromised-300-stores">Part 1. How I compromised 300 stores:</h2>
<p>I was on an online store, you know, to compare prices about something I wanted to buy. I got bored. I opened the Wappalyzer: Apache 2.4.46, Amazon EC2, PHP. Okay!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It all started as a “let’s see if this site is vulnerable to something or not”. I’m not gonna post names, and I’ll try to avoid any hints. The report about the vulnerabilities and the misconfigurations is still ongoing, so some issues may not be fixed everywhere yet.</p>
<p>It was not a Wordpress or another kind of CMS, okay… I checked the robots.txt. I found a panel to log in… I tried default credentials like admin/admin, etc., but were not working. Reading the footer of the log-in panel, I found two things. The store is part of a chain with more than 300 stores, and the CMS/Platform (I don’t know how to call it) was made by the same company. A little bit of “Googling” to confirm, and I found that <strong>ALL OF THEM</strong> have the same “CMS”, the same log-in panel, just a few differences like CSS, languages, etc. What if all of them have common credentials? Looks promising! 😅</p>
<p>Let’s scan the ports of this server to have a little bit more of information.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 21  open ftp  vsftpd 2.2.2</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 22  open ssh  OpenSSH 7.4</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 80  open http Apache httpd 2.4.48 Amazon OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.1.33</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 443 open ssl  Apache httpd</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I exported the scan on a file to have an idea about the services running on the server.</p>
<p>I’m always trying the basic things first. I tried some reflected/persistent XSS, SQL Injection on the search bar, etc,. there are some params in the URL, so I thought that I could inject code there, but I wasn’t successful in the beginning. At that moment I thought: “Well… maybe the people that built this custom CMS are sanitizing the params, or using I don’t know, some framework that is doing that for them under the hood”. Not really. Have you ever read before about Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Attacks? The search bar has some filters to apply, so I tried some things on them, and BINGO! 😎</p>
<p><code>https://www.target.com/action?q=search_term&amp;VULNERABLE_PARAM=1; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code></p>
<p>The magic happens with the <code>; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code> you can google more about it. The important thing here, is that I was able to dump the database. I was expecting just a few tables, the ones related with the site, but to my surprise there is just one schema with the name of this chain I saw before on the log in panel. This schema contains more than three thousand tables, yep, more than 3000 tables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, I invest some time trying to figure out the tables. Some of them in English, others in Spanish, also temporary tables, theoretically, but the interesting one was: <code>Usuarios</code>. I downloaded the data from this table, and a list of potential admin users, emails, phones, some tokens for purposes that I didn’t understand at that time, etc. At least the passwords were hashed.</p>
<p>I was kind of sad at this point. Thinking: “Well… this is the end. I found an SQL Injection, a <strong>lot of data</strong>, but nothing else.” My girlfriend and my dog suggested that I get off the computer, so I went to sleep. 🌖</p>
<p>I was searching for an inspirational quote to put it here, but I just came up with this one:</p>
<p><code>Every sunrise is a chance to think if you are on the correct path.</code></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wasn’t in the correct path. I had to figure out something else. I woke up, and I created a dictionary with data from the “Usuarios” table. Actually, brute force wasn’t needed. I got it on the first attempt. WTF? Seriously? 🤯 I got access to the dashboard as a Super Admin in less than 1 minute. The password of this guy was the same as his username. Nice! 👏🏼</p>
<p>I can’t upload a picture of it but imagine the common Bootstrap template for dashboards. I got access to <strong>everything</strong>: Orders, Discounts, Products, Clients, News/Posts, Newsletters, etc., and I had the permissions to do everything I wanted.</p>
<p>Is that a common practice of this company? Yes, it is. I haven’t tried the 300 stores, but I logged in to some of them as a Super Admin and I was able to login into other web pages that are not part of the chain with the same credentials.</p>
<p>I was lucky. I mean, in the end, it could just have been an SQL Injection, but you know… “Humans are the weakest link in the Cybersecurity chain.”</p>
<p>Let’s grab a beer, this is not the end. 🍺</p>
<h2 id="part-2.-how-i-compromised-a-spanish-consultancy">Part 2. How I compromised a “Spanish consultancy”:</h2>
<p>I thought about writing an email to these people, let them know about the vulnerabilities in their code, and the bad practices they have, but I didn’t at this point. I felt like I was able to find more things regarding this company. I used to work in consultancy before, and usually, these companies are involved in more than one project. So, I opened the browser, and I started to do a bit of “OSINT” about this company.</p>
<p>Valuable information I found:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company is involved in projects where are receiving money from &#34;concursos públicos&#34;.</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>(Projects for their &#34;Comunidad autónoma&#34; for example.)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The CMS it&#39;s not just being used in the 300 stores.</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>It&#39;s also reused in other projects, and yes, the credentials I found are still valid.</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company was offering different (vulnerable) products some of them as a SAAS.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are more things, but I want to keep this post short if possible. At this point, I knew a few things about the company. I tried to find subdomains, and one of them potentially caught my attention.</p>
<p>The company uses <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket Chat</a> (similar to Slack) under a subdomain, and you don’t need any VPN/2FA/whatever to log in. Figure out the credentials! Yeah, you are right! 😉 Our credentials works for the chat as well, and our guy has the Admin role.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All right, I was in! 🍾🥂 We could say that I was inside the company. At this point I was able to read private conversations with the employees, find words on public channels/private conversations, take a look at what they are saying about their clients… whatever I want… in the end, I logged in as their boss, and he has the Admin role.</p>
<p>Okay… Well, things I tried (and worked):</p>

<p>If we take a look at the ports scan I wrote above, we have ports 21/22 opened, right? So, let’s try to find the credentials in private conversations. Yep, I got FTP and SSH credentials!</p>
<p>At this point I was able to upload/download/modify the code, actually, this is how I found the database host + credentials because as you may know it’s quite common to have the credentials in some config file if you are not using, idk, AWS Secrets Manager or something similar.</p>
<p>Users are writing their credit cards here. Do you understand the risk of all of this?</p>
<p>Anyway… I was able to get a reverse shell and take a look to the server as well.</p>

<p>Having admin credentials, it’s critical per se. I mean, I can read their conversations about everything. However, we don’t have the credentials of everyone, looks like some employees are not following the bad practices, so their password is not their username. No worries, a little bit more “googling” and we can fix that!</p>
<h4 id="cookie-hijacking">Cookie Hijacking</h4>
<p>Rocket Chat allows you to create custom scripts in JavaScript. I was an admin, so, I could do that! The idea it’s create a script that does a request somewhere to save the <code>rc_uid</code> and <code>rc_token</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you have to be “creative?”. Let’s gonna create a simple PHP script and deploy it somewhere:</p>

      <title>An Open Letter Against Apple&#39;s Privacy-Invasive Content Scanning Technology</title>
      <link>https://appleprivacyletter.com/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___appleprivacyletter_com_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="letter">
			<h2>Dear Apple,</h2>
			<p>
				On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" target="_blank">announced</a> new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of <em>“Expanded Protections for Children”</em>. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, <strong>Apple&#39;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple&#39;s proposed technology works by <strong>continuously monitoring all photos stored or shared on a user&#39;s iPhone, iPad or Mac</strong>, and notifying the authorities if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately after Apple&#39;s announcement, experts around the world sounded the alarm on how Apple&#39;s proposed measures could turn every iPhone into a device that is continuously scanning all photos and messages that pass through it in order to report any objectionable content to law enforcement, setting a precedent where our personal devices become a radical new tool for invasive surveillance, with little oversight to prevent eventual abuse and unreasonable expansion of the scope of surveillance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation has said</a> that <strong><em>“Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“It’s impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses […] That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://cdt.org/press/cdt-apples-changes-to-messaging-and-photo-services-threaten-users-security-and-privacy/" target="_blank">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> has said that it is <strong><em>“deeply concerned that Apple’s changes in fact create new risks to children and all users, and mark a significant departure from long-held privacy and security protocols”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Apple is replacing its industry-standard end-to-end encrypted messaging system with an infrastructure for surveillance and censorship, which will be vulnerable to abuse and scope-creep not only in the U.S., but around the world,” says Greg Nojeim, Co-Director of CDT’s Security &amp; Surveillance Project. “Apple should abandon these changes and restore its users’ faith in the security and integrity of their data on Apple devices and services.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Carmela Troncoso, a leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554795487518723" target="_blank">has said</a> that while <strong><em>“Apple&#39;s new detector for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is promoted under the umbrella of child protection and privacy, it is a firm step towards prevalent surveillance and control”</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Matthew D. Green, another leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green" target="_blank">has said</a> that <strong><em>“yesterday we were gradually headed towards a future where less and less of our information had to be under the control and review of anyone but ourselves. For the first time since the 1990s we were taking our privacy back. Today we’re on a different path”</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/" target="_blank">adding</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“The pressure is going to come from the UK, from the US, from India, from China. I&#39;m terrified about what that&#39;s going to look like. Why Apple would want to tell the world, ‘Hey, we&#39;ve got this tool’?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Sarah Jamie Lewis, Executive Director of the <a href="https://openprivacy.ca" target="_blank">Open Privacy Research Society</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1423403656733290496" target="_blank">has warned</a> that:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“If Apple are successful in introducing this, how long do you think it will be before the same is expected of other providers? Before walled-garden prohibit apps that don&#39;t do it? Before it is enshrined in law? How long do you think it will be before the database is expanded to include &#34;terrorist&#34; content&#34;? &#34;harmful-but-legal&#34; content&#34;? state-specific censorship?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Nadim Kobeissi, a researcher in Security &amp; Privacy issues, <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423388549529968645">warned</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				”Apple sells iPhones without FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, because local regulation prohibits encrypted phone calls. That&#39;s just one example of many where Apple&#39;s bent to local pressure. What happens when local regulations in Saudi Arabia mandate that messages be scanned not for child sexual abuse, but for homosexuality or for offenses against the monarchy?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">statement</a> on the issue supports the above concern with additional examples on how Apple&#39;s proposed technology could lead to global abuse:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Take the example of India, where recently passed rules include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of “misinformation” in 24 hours may apply to messaging services. And many other countries—often those with authoritarian governments—have passed similar laws. Apple’s changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the Electronic Frontier Foundation insists that it&#39;s already seen this mission creep in action: <strong><em>“one of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of “terrorist” content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite calls from civil society.”</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Fundamental design flaws in Apple&#39;s proposed approach have also been pointed out by experts, who have <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423387147172724741" target="_blank">claimed</a> that <strong><em>“Apple can trivially use different media fingerprinting datasets for each user. For one user it could be child abuse, for another it could be a much broader category”</em></strong>, thereby enabling selective content tracking for targeted users.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type of technology that Apple is proposing for its child protection measures depends on an expandable infrastructure that can&#39;t be monitored or technically limited. Experts have <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554811086188548" target="_blank">repeatedly warned</a> that the problem isn&#39;t just privacy, but also the lack of accountability, technical barriers to expansion, and lack of analysis or even acknowledgement of the potential for errors and false positives.
 			</p>
			 <p>
				 Kendra Albert, a lawyer at the Harvard Law School&#39;s Cyberlaw Clinic, <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114" target="_blank">has warned</a> that <strong><em>“these &#34;child protection&#34; features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse”</em></strong>, adding:
			 </p>
			 <blockquote>
				“I just know (calling it now) that these machine learning algorithms are going to flag transition photos. Good luck texting your friends a picture of you if you have &#34;female presenting nipples.&#34;”
			 </blockquote>
			 <h3>Our Request</h3>
			 <p>
				 We, the undersigned, ask that:
			 </p>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Apple Inc.&#39;s&#39; deployment of its proposed content monitoring technology is halted immediately.</li>
				 <li>Apple Inc. issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to end-to-end encryption and to user privacy.</li>
			 </ol>
			 <p>
				 Apple&#39;s current path threatens to undermine decades of work by technologists, academics and policy advocates towards strong privacy-preserving measures being the norm across a majority of consumer electronic devices and use cases. We ask that Apple reconsider its technology rollout, lest it undo that important work.

      <title>The Cold War Fashion Showdown</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The Russians may have been winning the space race in the 1950s, but they couldn’t hold a candle to the sophistication of Western dress.</p><figure><figcaption>In the summer of 1959, the Cold War moved from the fields of science and technology to that of cultural exchange. </figcaption></figure><p>By the late 1950s, having <a href="https://www.space.com/17563-sputnik.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fired the first shot</a> in the space war, Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev extended the competition with the West to everyday culture and lifestyle. Thus, in the summer of 1959 the Cold War moved to the ﬁeld of cultural exchange. The Soviets organized an exhibition of their scientiﬁc, technological, and cultural achievements in New York, and the Americans followed with their own national exhibition in Moscow. Both Russians and Americans tried to show off their best clothes on each occasion. The official repositioning of the phenomenon of fashion in socialism therefore took place within the context of a ﬁght for cultural supremacy.</p><p>American vice president Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat, traveled to Moscow to open the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Fifty_Years_Ago_American_Exhibition_Stunned_Soviets_in_Cold_War/1783913.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American National Exhibition</a>. Before their visit, Pat Nixon carefully chose a new wardrobe, as reported in Newsweek:</p><blockquote><p>One suit of natural raw silk, a brown silk taffeta cocktail dress, a silk and cotton ﬂowered print dress with jacket and two other dresses. Most of her clothes were bought at Henry Bendel’s in New York where Pat spent an hour—and several hundred dollars. “They are costumes,” she explained. “Mostly full-skirted dresses with matching accessories to make a ‘picture.’ They are not high fashion and they’re the sort of thing I like, and which I think looks best on me.”</p></blockquote><p>At the opening of the exhibition, in the company of her husband and the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov, Pat Nixon glowed in her natural raw silk suit and smart hat. She looked just as she was supposed to: like a sophisticated and well-heeled American housewife. The message was clear: the Russians might be ahead in space research and education, but they cannot match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady going about her everyday life.</p><p>Pat Nixon’s carefully chosen wardrobe revealed a lifestyle with which the Russians could not compete. This lifestyle was even recited by IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAMAC</a>, the first commercial computer, present at the exhibition, which provided four thousand answers about different aspects of life in America. One of them offered information in perfect Russian about the wardrobe of an average American woman. She owned: <em>“Winter coat, spring coat, raincoat, ﬁve house dresses, four afternoon ‘dressy’ dresses, three suits, three skirts, six blouses, two petticoats, ﬁve nightgowns, eight panties, ﬁve brassières, two corsets, two robes, six pairs of nylon stockings, two pairs of sports socks, three pairs of dress gloves, three pairs of play shorts, one pair of slacks, one play suit, and accessories.”</em></p><p>During the exhibition, American fashion was presented at four thirty-ﬁve-minute-long fashion shows that took place each day, each of them attended by three thousand to ﬁve thousand Russians. The Soviet authorities had opposed many of the American proposals for the exhibition, but eventually the Russian audiences got a chance to enjoy the American fashion shows, which consisted of youthful clothes, leisure wear, daily ensembles, and formal long evening dresses.</p><p>Attempting to bring the Russians “a living slice of America,” the outﬁts were presented by professional models as well as children, teenagers, grandparents, and whole families. Newsweek described the fashion show as boring, but acknowledged the political meaning behind the clothes: “The dresses were all right, though a bit on the dull side,” they reported. “The whole idea behind it was to show the people of the Soviet Union how the average American woman dresses at work and at play — not the glamorous girl on Park Avenue, but the young matron on Main Street.” The choice of everyday mass-produced American clothes was very powerful propaganda. If sophisticated outﬁts from New York fashion salons had been shown, they could easily have been attacked as elitist clothes meant for the exploiting class. But the Americans knew only too well that the Russians could not compete in the ﬁeld of decent mass-produced clothing.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” reported the New York Times.</p></blockquote></figure><p>While fashion contributed to the huge propaganda effect that the American National Exhibition had in Moscow, the American media commented on the shortcomings in the culture of everyday Soviet life at the Russian exchange exhibition that had taken place only two months earlier in the New York Coliseum. “The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/30/80589100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> the New York Times, “with clothes and furs that are rarely seen on Moscow streets.” The fashion show that was included in the exhibition drew ironic comments from Western journalists. Five female models and one male model displayed designs by Soviet fashion designers from the leading Moscow department store GUM and the <em>Dom modelei, </em>or House of Prototypes, an institution created by Stalin to produce prototypes for socialist fashion. Time magazine reported that “the textiles, mostly thick, heavy-textured woolen suits, are more impressive for their usefulness against the Russian winter than for their styles, which are clumsy attempts to copy western designs.”</p><p>Though the American media declared GUM’s outﬁts “clumsy copies,” they were actually the most prestigious representations of Soviet-style elegance. In 1956, GUM’s general director, V. G. Kamenov, wrote a booklet describing in detail the services that the Soviet ﬂagship department store offered. Fashion ateliers for custom-made clothes and special shops selling natural silk, artistically hand-painted silk, women’s hats, fur coats, and perfumes were supposed to present an idea of abundance and sophistication. In the illustrations accompanying the text, attentive sales personnel were shown offering customers these traditionally luxurious goods. One section of the booklet dealt with new sales techniques, while another praised the fashion salons within the store, which offered individual service in sumptuous surroundings.</p><p>The store’s interior, ﬁlled with dark carved wooden furniture, crystal chandeliers, and heavy velvet curtains, was similar to the Stalinist concept of palaces of consumption of the 1930s. The store continued an outdated, grandiose aesthetics that promoted the mythical Stalinist concept of luxury. But this Stalinist gloriﬁcation of reality, which tried to remove all conﬂicting and erratic elements from everyday life, could not compete with ordinary life in the West. Thus, with the opening of the Soviet Union toward the West, the disjunction between the deprivation of everyday life and its ideal representation became blatantly obvious.</p><div><figure><figcaption>The fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Pictured in this 1959 cover of Life magazine: Pat Nixon with her Soviet counterparts: (from left) Mrs. Mikoian, Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Khrushcheva, and Mrs. Kozlova.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the late 1950s, in comparison with the efficiency of the large American department stores and the diversity and quality of the mass-produced goods that they offered, GUM had become outdated and provincial, as direct contacts with the West painfully revealed. The cover of Life magazine from August 1959 showed that the fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Flanked by Mrs. Mikoian (on her left), Nina Khrushcheva (right), and Mrs. Kozlova (far right), Pat Nixon appeared as a smartly dressed upper-class American housewife. The Life magazine cover was a visual testament to the Soviet diplomats’ wives’ inability to match the sophisticated, worldly style of Pat Nixon in her silk, ﬂower-printed dress, a string of pearls, and carefully applied makeup, as well as her svelte ﬁgure. Accompanying their husbands, the ladies attended a dinner table conference at Khrushchev’s <em>dacha</em>, or country house.</p><p>There were signiﬁcant visual differences among the three Soviet politicians’ wives, which pointed to their different levels of sartorial awareness. Nina Khrushcheva was clad in the simplest dress, which buttoned at the front. Called <em>khalat</em>, this style had become a domestic uniform of Soviet women. Women wore <em>khalat</em> at home, whether going about their domestic work, cooking, resting, or entertaining. Mrs. Mikoian was dressed in a sartorially more demanding outﬁt: a suit, with a cut that discreetly shaped the body. Her suit was modest, but its proletarian asceticism was softened with a little hat. That fashion detail showed a certain investment in her look, transforming her simple suit into an outdoor outﬁt.</p><p>The formal outﬁt worn by the wife of the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov showed a full awareness of the importance of the occasion. Mrs. Kozlova’s evening gown, embellished with embroidery around the neckline, as well as her embroidered muslin stole, her white evening handbag, her white gloves, her hairstyle and makeup showed a new attitude toward fashionable dress. But Mrs. Kozlova could not yet match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady of the same social standing. The ideologically informed rejection of fashion’s history was imprinted on Mrs. Kozlova’s dress even more so than on Mrs. Mikoian’s simple suit or Nina Khrushcheva’s symbolically burdened housedress.</p><p>Mrs. Kozlova’s appearance not only acknowledged contemporary formal Western dress, but it broke an important socialist dress code. The most important members of the political bureaucracy or nomenklatura had always dressed modestly in public, a practice that had started with the Bolsheviks. Stalin and his political circle had also stuck to the proletarian ideal of modesty in their public looks, although their private lives had been loaded with all the symbols of traditional luxury, from fur coats to house help, antique furniture, and ﬁne food. The Old Bolshevik wives Nina Khrushcheva and Mrs. Mikoian respected the longstanding nomenklatura dress code. Recognizing that times were changing, Mrs. Kozlova, however, dared to transgress it.</p><hr/><p><em>Djurdja Bartlett is Reader in Histories and Cultures of Fashion at the London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London, and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FashionEast-Spectre-Haunted-Socialism-Press/dp/0262026503" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FashionEast: The Spectre that Haunted Socialism</a>.</em>“</p></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <div>
      <p>Today, Acting Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine sent the following letter to Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook’s misleading claims regarding the company’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">consent decree with the FTC</a>:</p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: </span></p>

<p><span>I write concerning Facebook’s recent insinuation that its actions against an academic research project conducted by NYU’s Ad Observatory were required by the company’s consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. As the company has since acknowledged, this is inaccurate. The FTC is committed to protecting the privacy of <em>people</em>, and efforts to shield targeted advertising practices from scrutiny run counter to that mission.</span></p>

<p><span>While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter. Only last week, Facebook’s General Counsel, Jennifer Newstead, committed the company to “timely, transparent communication to BCP staff about significant developments.” Yet the FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.</span></p>

<p><span>Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest. Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising. While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy – much less the FTC consent order – as a pretext to advance other aims. </span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>

<p><em><span>/s/ Samuel Levine </span></em></p>

<p><span>Acting Director</span></p>

<p>I am <s>broke</s> “non-liquid” right now. Normally, that sentence doesn’t have geopolitical ramifications on the creation of hybrid private-public surveillance state. But in my case it does.</p>



<p>It started rather innocuously. Someone couldn’t send me money. No matter what they did. They couldn’t transfer any money. Curious. We started experimenting with different friends, companies, and acquaintances. None of them could send me money. <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> wouldn’t provide any explanation. My business had been a paying customer for more than ~4+ years. And now, I was locked out. Okay. They’re hardly the only fish in the sea.</p>



<p>Except it happened again. This time with our bank, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>†. Okay, that’s strange. They asked for more details. We sent them details. Scans of my documentation. They’d revert back a few days later for more details. And we’d send it to them again. On and on we went chasing each other around the maypole. A few weeks passed, and Mercury’s team finally cut to the chase, they asked if I was affiliated with Entity X. We said no. But it didn’t matter. They froze me out anyway.</p>



<p>In some ways, we’re lucky that they flagged the transfer, because they gave us the first clue of what was going on. A friend ended up having the insight to search for Entity X (thanks Nick!) and found that <em>they’d been sanctioned</em>. Okay. What did this have to do with me?</p>



<p>On further investigation, we found that I shared my legal name with someone working with Entity X. Great. It’s a common name, like Robert Brown or Mary Johnson. Shouldn’t it be easy to prove that I’m not person X? A little Googling later, I found that the United States Department of the Treasury has an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and they have an email address for “reconsideration” if you’ve been mistakenly placed on the sanctions list. As I’m clearly not the person they were looking to sanction, I decided that the most logical course of action would be write to them, and get their assent that I am indeed not the human that they’re looking for.</p>



<p>We wrote something up (once again, thanks Nick). And we sent it in.</p>



<p>The OFAC replied, to their credit, quite promptly with a link for false positives, and they told me to send this to the bank. Okay. Done. Except, it didn’t matter. Mercury blocked me anyway. The saga finished with me getting nada.</p>



<p>I wrote back to the OFAC requesting them to write something, anything on an official looking letterhead stating the simple fact that I, Person X born on such and such date with an ID number of Z, am not the person who has been sanctioned. I offered to provide them with additional details if there was any hesitancy on their part.</p>



<p>They haven’t replied. And I still can’t get any cash.</p>



<p>What’s amazing about this saga is that I have a statistically common legal name. There are thousands of people running around with this name. And effectively, they’ve <em>all</em> been barred from the global financial system.</p>



<p>To their credit, the OFAC publishes additional details for each person to prevent this exact scenario from occurring. However, these details seem to vary across individuals and countries. It doesn’t seem to be a neat dataset to model. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists" target="_blank">the lists are available online in .PDF and .TXT files,</a> and it’s a mess. Also, there isn’t one list, but rather multiple lists, with different details. As far as I can tell, there is no <em>official</em> API. There is no efficient way for programmers designing, say a “[bank] built for startups” to comply with the Treasury. Consequently, someone decided, in a meeting room somewhere, to punt the problem.</p>



<p>If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just run a simple match against the name – the one element of the dataset guaranteed to be there – and then punt it to our underpaid and understaffed KYC department to deal with? And the KYC department punted it to legal. And legal took one look and went, “hrm, what’s our downside risk if we approve this? Do we know this person is indeed the one being sanctioned? Oh, I see. Well let’s just block them. There’s not much they can do about it.”</p>



<p>And so, I am currently <s>broke</s> non-liquid. Kafka would have been proud.</p>



<p><em>(for connoisseurs of dark humor, I find it particularly hilarious that more likely than not the person they’re targeting will never be affected by this. This person, with whom I have the misfortune of sharing a legal name, doesn’t seem to perform many international transactions. She lives in a cash-first developing country, where the sanctions have no reach. She’s but a lowly piece in a very big game)</em></p>



<hr/>



<p>In other news, Apple has decided to scan images on your phone. For child porn, of course. There aren’t enough people (nor PR capital) to look through all of your photos. So, they’ve done the efficient thing instead. They’re simply going to match all of your photos, on your phone, against a hash of child porn images. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Other, more eloquent commentators,</a> have pointed out the danger this poses. Apple often bends over for authoritarian regimes like China, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/technology/apple-hong-kong-app.html">remove apps that help pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong avoid police violence</a>. Or, that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned">the company doesn’t allow adults to view adult content on the devices that they own</a>. Or, in more conservative countries, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avng9/apple-is-letting-over-150-countries-censor-lgbtq-content-in-the-app-store">removing any apps that mention the inconvenient existence of LGBTQ+ people</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">Wikipedia has an exhaustive list.</a></p>



<p>However, it is not my purpose to repeat what these commentators have already said. Nor to write a polemic for its own sake. My goal is to use my experience to peer into the future. To predict, through inevitability, the chain of events for poor souls in days yet to pass.</p>



<p>Just like the programmers who chose to match names against the sanctions list, while the KYC and legal departments handle the rest, Apple is matching all of the private photos on your phone against a list. This list is generated using something called a hash function. It turns an image into a number that a computer can then use to make the comparison. The process looks a bit like this, </p>







<p>Please note this is an example from a lovely blog that goes through this process. Apple’s process is different, but inherently similar.</p>



<p>In most cases, when we’re dealing with hashes in computer science, we’re looking for exact matches. But this case is different. Criminals aren’t stupid. They’re often not clever, but not all of them are stupid. What if they add a filter? Or, change the image somehow? Maybe add in a blur? What then?</p>



<p>Well, clearly, they can’t make every variation possible of every image that the police are looking for. If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just look for <em>similarity</em> instead and then punt it to law enforcement to deal with? To put it another way, the question Apple is asking isn’t, “is this image exactly like this photo from the child porn database?” No, the question Apple is asking is, “is this image similar to this photo from the child porn database?” Where the “similar” question is answered by a very clever, but very dumb algorithm.</p>



<p>In my case, when the programmers punted to the KYC department and legal, a bunch of transactions were cancelled. In this case, the police will raid your house and arrest you for “child porn.”</p>



<p>The image they will raid you for wouldn’t even necessarily have to be an adult one. Computers are strange. They are very literal beings. They do <em>exactly</em> what they are told, which is both their greatest asset and weakness. For example, this neural network thinks that this cat is guacamole,</p>







<p>Apple’s algorithm is <em>very different</em>, but it is susceptible to the same problems. In this case, noise was added into the image to make the neural network classify the cat as guacamole. In your case, it could be just happenstance. Random noise due to lighting conditions that takes an innocent photo (or, more likely, an intimate photo of you or your partner) and makes the algorithm assume that it is <em>similar</em> to a restricted photo.</p>



<p>Just like me, one day you’ll wake up and notice that something weird might be going on. Maybe it’s a car parked outside your street. Maybe it’s a feeling like people are following you. You won’t be that alarmed at first. You’ll dismiss it. But, eventually, it will come crashing in. Your door will be knocked open by SWAT. And you will find yourself facing armored people in guns to your confusion. They’ll scream for you to raise your hands and put them behind your head. They’ll say, “ma’am we have a warrant for your arrest.” And confused, you’ll be walked out to a waiting squad car.</p>



<p>Your local newspaper will write, “[You] has been arrested for possessing child pornography.” But you won’t read the headline. You’ll be in an interrogation room. Waiting for them to come in. Maybe the officer is letting you sweat it out. Maybe not. But eventually they’ll come in and they’ll start interrogating you. “Ma’am do you consume pornography that has minors in it?”</p>



<p>And you’ll deny it. They’ll put your phone in front of you. It’ll be in one of those bags. You’ll unlock it for them. And you’ll know that they’re going to go through everything. Including that embarrassing pic you took for K.</p>



<p>They won’t find anything. So they’ll return to question you. Maybe you’ve deleted the photos, who knows? Let’s pass it on to forensics and see what they come up with.</p>



<p>Eventually, you’ll end up being detained in jail. Your bail will be set high. You’ll have to plead and explain to everyone around you that you don’t know what’s happening. You don’t know why this happened. And those near you might believe you, but there will be this doubt that crosses through their mind. Just for a second. They’ll have this doubt, and that doubt will always be there for the rest of their life.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough to have money, you’ll get a lawyer. They’ll work on getting you out. Eventually, the forensics will return nothing. Your lawyer will succeed in getting you to walk free. And you’ll walk back to your home, with stares from your neighbors.</p>



<p>In a few months, it’ll come out that no, Apple’s algorithm screwed up here. Apple will blame law enforcement. Law enforcement will blame Apple. It doesn’t matter. That newspaper will put up a small story on their site about how you’re really innocent. It won’t get many clicks. And the one about you getting arrested for possessing child porn will stay up forever. With a note added to it, if you’re lucky.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll get your life back. Maybe not. But you’ll spend the rest of your life under this cloud, because some programmer somewhere wrote this code. And everyone else assumed that it just works.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_bhphotovideo_com_explora_photography_hands-on-review_classic-cameras-my-dads-argus-c3/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For as long as I can remember, the heavy chunk of black Bakelite and chrome nicknamed “The Brick,” was a staple on a shelf in my parents’ living room. Officially known as the Argus C3, this solid pointy-edged rangefinder is said to be one of the most popular cameras in history, selling about 2 million units during its extraordinary 27-year production run, from 1939 to 1966.</p>
<p>While this camera belonged to my father, I have little memory of him using it, and even less of a sense for when and how he acquired it, or which images were made with the Argus when sifting through many decades of disorganized family snapshots squirreled away in cardboard boxes at home.</p>
<p>By the time I was in grade school, my father had largely abandoned the dials and knobs of this stately machine for the automatic exposure controls of a Kodak Brownie Auto 27. And while it’s easy to distinguish the square-format prints that Kodak generated from the mountain of other memories that make up our family picture collection, determining which of the earlier pictures were made with the Argus is indeed a mystery.</p>
<h3>The American Leica</h3>
<p>The company behind the Argus C3 was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Charles A. Verschoor, in 1931. Initially a radio manufacturer, an early product, the Kadette, was the first mass-produced AC/DC radio, using tubes instead of a large transformer. Although successful, radio sales were highly seasonal in the days before air conditioning, dropping off in summer months as people abandoned indoor entertainment for outdoor pursuits. To keep his factory and salesmen working all year, Verschoor searched for a product that could be cheaply manufactured and sold during the warmer half of the year.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/01-argus_c3_dsc4576_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>My father’s Argus C3, affectionately known as “the Brick.”</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>He was impressed by the early 35mm Leica cameras he saw during a business trip to Germany, and came up with a plan to adopt the same Bakelite molding technology used for radio casings, to make an affordable camera that would be similar to the Leica. From its debut in early 1936, Verschoor’s initial model A camera was a huge success, prompting him to name his new product line Argus, from the Greek mythological god of 1,000 eyes.</p>
<p>Designed and patented by Gustave Fassin, in 1938, the first Argus C model cameras were uncoupled rangefinders, which required the user to manually rotate the lens barrel to match the rangefinder reading. An upgraded model, the Argus C2, provided a coupled rangefinder, and in 1939 the Argus C3 added built-in flash synchronization via an accessory flash gun.</p>
<h3>Determining Provenance</h3>
<p>Turning back to my treasure trove of photos, I found some handwritten notes on the back of certain dog-eared prints indicating that my father had a camera in his possession during World War II. Could he have purchased the Argus C3 shortly after its release, before shipping out to basic training as a 20-year-old, and then on to the Canal Zone, and Europe? Whatever camera he had, it was certainly a model with a bulb setting—which the Argus C3 possessed—based on all the forerunners to selfie culture I found among his prints, along with a note scribbled on the back of a picture of him reclining in his bunk, describing his shooting process.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Four images of my father at Albrook Field, Canal Zone, made with a camera he owned during World War II. While he may have had help with the first three portraits, he wrote that he used the bulb setting on the back of the last print. It took me a lot of sleuthing to discover what camera he used for these pictures. Read through to the end to find out.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The extreme popularity of the Argus C3 has made it a cult classic, even though the company ceased production of this model in 1966. Turning to the Internet, I soon found a website that allows Argus owners to estimate a camera’s manufacturing date based on the camera’s serial number. If that data is accurate, my father’s camera was likely made in 1951, an ownership date that seems more plausible, as my father would have then been 32 years old, and in the process of building our house. Indeed, I have a vivid memory of a collection of spiral-bound albums showing every step of the construction process. Although these albums have since been disassembled, a large pile of surviving prints offers evidence that he was playing with a new toy while climbing scaffolding and driving nails.</p>
<p>According to some accounts, the public was captivated by the camera’s scientific appearance, with all its shiny metal dials and knobs on the front, along the top, and on the bottom. As a former airplane mechanic, and a newly minted electrician, and having the budding reputation as “mister fix-it,” it’s not hard to imagine my dad being drawn to what at the time was a powerful mix of deluxe features and affordable cost.</p>
<h3>Operating the Camera</h3>
<p>While the C3’s brick-like body has little in common with modern ergonomics, there is something satisfying about the weight of this camera in the hands. Looking down at the jet-black top surface, metal dials at left and right control the shutter release and film winding, while a rudimentary frame counter sits squarely on top, backed by a small hexagonal film catch. The shutter button has two settings—B for bulb and I for Instantaneous—marked on its chrome skirt, and the top of the button is threaded for the addition of a cable release.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the shutter release, the metal teeth of the rangefinder gear protrude from the top along the camera’s front edge, allowing the user to turn the rangefinder dial with their shutter finger, which engages the idler gear to focus the lens.</p>

</div><figcaption>Six images of my parents’ home in various stages of construction. The year was 1952-53, and I’m certain he was using the Argus C3. Since the negatives have long since vanished, these images were scanned from 2x3&#34; prints.</figcaption></figure><p>To the right of the rangefinder dial, two rectangular windows are home to separate finders: the viewfinder, which is used to compose a picture, and the rangefinder, which is used to focus with the aid of a split image. As you turn the rangefinder dial the two halves of the image move into or out of register, with the bottom half of the finder window tinted yellow as a visual aid. When the top and bottom halves line up at your desired focal point, your subject will be in focus. Alternatively, you can zone focus by turning the lens itself and estimating the subject-to-lens distance from the rangefinder dial.</p>
<p>A shutter speed dial in the upper right front corner controls the length of time the shutter will be open to light, with different versions of the camera offering a range of five, seven, or ten different speeds between 1/10 to 1/300 second.</p>
<p>Tying all these elements together is the camera lens, which is interchangeable due to the placement of the three-leaf shutter inside the camera body itself, not between the lens elements. A screw mount lens plate above the shutter mechanism accepts three different lenses, the default being a 50mm f/3.5 anastigmat triplet lens, the Argus Coated Cintar. My father also owned the 100mm f/4.5 Tele-Sandmar, made by Enna Werk, in Germany, while a C3 wide-angle lens also offered a 35mm f/4.5 focal length, ideal for group shots and working in tight spaces.</p>
<h3>Calibrating the Lens for Proper Rangefinder Focusing</h3>
<p>Since the lens is coupled to the rangefinder dial, to ensure proper focus it’s essential to carefully follow outlined steps when removing or replacing different lenses. When running my first roll of film through the camera, I overlooked these instructions, and the film ended up completely blurred. The text below is taken from the Argus C3 instruction manual, which proved to be all I needed for acceptable image sharpness. Yet, if that doesn’t work, more advanced instructions about correcting the rangefinder settings by removing a small circular dial on top of the camera can be found online.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/12-argus_c3_dsc4580_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Top view of the Argus C3. The small metal disk midway between the counter dial and film advance is the Rangefinder cover, which can be removed to fine tune both horizontal and vertical focus adjustments.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><em>To remove lens: Set the Rangefinder dial to the 3-foot mark, then unscrew the Idler Gear cap and lift out the gear, before unscrewing the lens by turning to the left.</em></p>
<p><em>To replace lens: Screw it back into the camera by turning to the right, past the resistance point until it is seated firmly. Then turn the lens back towards the left until a wide range of gear teeth are opposite the Idler Gear shaft. </em></p>
<p><em>Drop the Idler Gear into place on its metal post, and then turn the lens back to the right as far as it will go. This will position the lens at the infinity mark. Remove the Idler Gear, being careful not to disturb the lens position. Set the rangefinder dial exactly to infinity by turning it to the right and replace the Idler Gear without disturbing the positions of the lens or the Rangefinder dial.</em></p>
<p><em>Set the Rangefinder dial at the 3-foot mark, and screw on the Idler Gear cap. The camera is now ready for pictures!</em></p>
<h3>Running Film</h3>
<p>My father’s camera offers a purely analog shooting experience, with neither a battery or light meter to rein you in (although a later version, the Argus C3 Matchmatic, did boast an exposure meter on top). While it is feasible to use the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/sunny-16-rule">Sunny 16 Rule</a> as an exposure guide, I opted to use the meter in my miniscule Sony RX100 V as a digital chimp sheet of sorts, to speed the shooting process.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/13-argus_c3_dsc4575_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Interior view of the Argus C3, showing the camera’s three-blade shutter and film advance mechanisms. The two circular windows along the top are for the viewfinder (<em>left</em>) and rangefinder (<em>right</em>).</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Film is easily loaded into the camera by depressing the side latch and swinging open the back door, securing the film canister against the prong of the rewind knob, and threading the end of the film through a slot in the take up spindle at the other end. This method of loading film was much easier than Leica’s removable bottom panel design, which no doubt contributed to the Argus’s popularity during that era, in addition to its lower cost.</p>
<p>On top of the camera, the film advance knob is clearly marked with an arrow and the word wind, but to initiate a photo one must first activate the shutter cocking lever on the front. The rudimentary nature of using separate functions for cocking the shutter and advancing the film, combined with the complexity of rangefinder focusing, and the guesswork of proper exposure calculations, makes for a plodding, multi-step process, which can be a haven for error.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>The graphic lines and dimensionality of this steel globe was perfect for testing the C3’s focus and depth of field. What I didn’t factor in was a double exposure that resulted from a lapse of attention as I moved too quickly between shots. Despite the chaotic mash-up of lines and reflections in that image, I rather like it.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>One of the easiest and most prevalent mistakes to make occurs when the user exposes a picture but forgets to advance the film before cocking the shutter and shooting a second frame, thereby double-exposing. When not caused by a moment of forgetfulness, double exposure has great potential for creative expression, and arguments can even be made for the validity of double exposures caused by chance. However, when shooting with this camera, it’s advisable to adopt the concentration and presence of mind generally associated with large format analog photography, for best results.</p>
<p>Therefore, immediately after tripping the shutter, direct your attention to the black numbered film counter, and more specifically to the hexagonal metal tab—otherwise known as the film catch—at the back of the counter. To advance the film, begin winding the advance knob while pressing the film catch, and release the catch after a quarter turn. Then continue winding until the point of resistance, which means that you’ve arrived at the next frame. Repeat the process as you watch the film counter advance from one hash mark to the next. Once you encounter continuous resistance when trying to advance the film you’ve arrived at the end of the roll.</p>
<p>To rewind, simply turn the knurled winding knob at the bottom of the camera in the direction of the arrow using slow gentle pressure. In my experience, film sprockets are prone to tearing during the rewinding process, so it may be advisable to have a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=film%20changing%20bag&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=">film changing bag</a> handy in case you need to extract the film by opening the camera before it’s completely back in its case.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts on Use</h3>
<p>Considering the vagaries of framing pictures through the C3’s tiny, well-worn viewfinder, and ascertaining sharpness through a rangefinder that sometimes seems to function more like a Kaleidoscope, I was pleasantly surprised with some of my pictures. To be clear, this would not be an enjoyable tool for any photographer seeking precision or ease of use, yet as I began to settle into the process, I began to have fun exploring the camera’s limits, using a roll of <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/24624-REG/Ilford_1748192_Delta_400_Professional_135_36_Black.html">Ilford Delta 400 black-and-white film</a>.</p>

It was a bright sunny day, but the trees cast dappled sunlight, allowing me to open my 50mm f/3.5 Argus Coated Cintar lens to a wide aperture. After toying with the rangefinder focus in an overview shot, I decided to test its 3-foot minimum focal length in a close-up. At that distance, it’s much easier to adjust focus by moving the camera itself until the two halves of the rangefinder match up in the desired spot, rather than turning the rangefinder gear.</p>
<p>Once I had explored photo options in the park for a while, I made my way to Fifth Avenue and began photographing some of the stately monuments on my way to Rockefeller Center. Discovering the Atlas statue adorned with fresh flowers, I studied the monument from all sides to look for interesting angles. The midafternoon sun was beating down from the southwest, creating a strong backlight effect that I knew would be a great test for lens flare. Although the glare made it barely possible to focus or frame the shot below at right, the lens captured a much better picture than I had anticipated, with just a thin veil of flare along the bottom part of the image.</p>
<div><figure><div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/19-jill_argus_c3015.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/20-jill_argus_c3017.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div></div><figcaption>The C3’s rangefinder focus held true.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The images I shot were hand-developed using <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/213174-REG/Ilford_1960457_ID_11_Film_Developer.html">Ilford ID 11</a> at a dilution of 1:3 for 18 minutes. All the pictures in this story (prints and negatives) were scanned on an <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/647187-REG/Epson_B11B198011_Perfection_V600_Photo_Scanner.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">Epson Perfection V600 Photo Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>And, about the camera my father used during World War II. After much searching, I discovered an old picture album full of prints he had made during this period. While flipping through the pages, I happened upon a folded piece of white paper, which I opened to find an official note from his Commanding Officer, dated August 7, 1941, authorizing him to own a camera, which at that time was an Argus Model A, serial # 199578. Sadly, I have no idea where that camera is today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section role="main"><section><section><div id="post__wrapper-90660570"><div><div><div data-id="90660570" data-slug="the-smart-home-is-flailing-as-a-concept-because-it-sucks"><div><div><article><p>A couple of weeks ago, the tech industry group Consumer Technology Association (CTA) released a predictably cheery report on the state of consumer technology. It forecasted record-breaking revenues of $487 billion this year, with laptops, wireless earbuds, personal fitness devices, and 5G phones singled out for especially strong growth.</p><div><p>Yet tucked into that upbeat forecast was a spot of dreariness: Smart home devices, once <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/why-2017-will-finally-be-the-year-of-the-smart-home-consumers-figure-it-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hailed</a> as tech’s <a href="https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/how-and-why-the-tech-giants-are-fighting-for-the-home-platform-811f5b6174e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big computing platform</a>, would experience flat revenues of $15 billion in 2021, with unit sales up 11%.</p><p>The CTA says its stagnant forecast is merely a function of competition, as an influx of device makers drive down the cost of hardware. But as someone who’s been living with various smart home gadgets for several years now, I have a different theory: They’re just not worth a big investment unless you have a limitless supply of time and patience.</p><h2>An airing of grievances</h2><p>When you press a button on your phone—say, to make a phone call or take a photo—you probably expect that button to work every time. But that’s not the way things work with smart home devices.</p></div><div><p>Just this week, for instance, the two Alexa-connected blinds in my bedroom failed to roll down at their scheduled time, and this morning, only one of them opened back up again. I have no idea what went wrong, because Alexa doesn’t offer any feedback when things fail, so all I could do was try again until the routine triggered properly.</p><p>Those kinds of misfires are common in the smart home world. I’ve had Google Assistant refuse to set alarms or read upcoming calendar events for several days in a row, only to fix itself without explanation. My Ecobee thermostat occasionally gets stuck on a single temperature, requiring a reboot. I’ve had light bulbs inexplicably fail to connect to their hub device. And I’m pretty confident that every Echo speaker owner has experienced Alexa playing the wrong music at least once.</p><p>The problem, says Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, is that smart home devices haven’t gotten much better at avoiding these problems even as the market edges toward mainstream users. Instead, a proliferation of new devices and use cases has multiplied the ways in which things to go wrong.</p></div><div><p>“At the beginning, you obviously had early adopters who usually have a higher level of patience,” she says. “But now that the market is somewhat mature, you’re not going to stand for that. You’re not going to be happy if you can’t rely on it. If your alarm doesn’t go off, there are consequences.”</p><h2>Too many choices</h2><p>Making sense of what to buy in the first place also brings its own challenges. Chaos reigns at every step in the smart home purchase process, and you can easily end up with a pile of devices that don’t work together. The SmartThings lights in my bedroom don’t work with Apple’s Siri assistant, and my Tilt blinds only work with Alexa. To control my Liftmaster garage door opener by voice, I must first connect it through a third-party service called <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFTTT</a>. The Philips Wiz smart bulb outside my office don’t work with Apple’s HomeKit system (though Philips’s separate Hue lighting brand does).</p><p>Even the relatively simple act of playing music across multiple smart speakers involves a mess of proprietary protocols. The Sonos Beam soundbar responds to voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa, but only supports multi-room audio with other Sonos or Apple AirPlay speakers. To connect my soundbar with Google Home or Echo devices in other rooms, I’d have to plug a Chromecast or Fire TV (or both) into my television first.</p></div><div><p>A couple weeks ago, I also lost control of my SmartThings light bulbs entirely. That’s because Samsung decided to stop supporting a product it launched three years ago for <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3239730/samsung-smartthings-link-for-nvidia-shield-tv-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming box into a SmartThings device hub</a>. I’ve yet to set up the replacement hub that Samsung offered at a discount, because it requires pairing every bulb all over again. (Owners of Wink smart home hubs went through a similar ordeal last year, when that company switched to a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/wink-delays-subscription-service-one-week-in-response-to-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mandatory subscription model</a>.)</p><p>When I explain this temporary inconvenience to my wife, she rightfully rolls her eyes. While she’s been a good sport about my smart home endeavors, she’s also keenly aware of how annoying they can be.

The inherent wonkiness of our current setup has permanently dissuaded her from entire categories of devices—most notably, smart door locks—and we’ve mutually decided against installing security cameras of any kind.

He points to robots as a big area of potential growth, with the industry moving beyond basic vacuums and into floor washers and lawn mowers.</p><p>“Over time, as people continue to improve their homes, they’ll see opportunities to upgrade to connected devices and build out their home network,” Kowalski says.</p><div id="pullquote--90660570"><blockquote><p>Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own.</p></blockquote></div><p>He’s probably right, in the sense that people will slowly amass patchworks of gadgets in the same way that I have over the past few years. But the original promise of the smart home wasn’t merely about automating a handful of random tasks. Companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google were instead supposed to provide a kind of central intelligence for the home, tying together an array of devices in clever and delightful ways. The idea is that a smart alarm clock would know to open your blinds and turn on the lights in the morning, or that your sleep tracker would know to turn the thermostat down when you’re not resting comfortably.</p></div><div><p>Today, those companies are still figuring out exactly how to do all that. Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own, such as Home- and Away-based automation routines. Apple still has two separate interfaces for home automation—one through its Home app, and another through Shortcuts. Amazon still maintains three separate smart home systems through Alexa, Ring, and Blink. Only recently have all three tech giants agreed on a <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single wireless smart home protocol</a>, which would reduce the number of bridges and hubs people have to install.</p><p>It’s all just so hopelessly confusing right now, and it’s probably not going to get better anytime soon.</p><p>“People continue to buy thermostats and locks and lights, but I don’t know that we’ve moved the industry forward from an experience perspective,” Milanesi says. “It’s not actually that smart.”</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></section></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <div>
    <p>A few people have asked me lately what makes for a good podcast.  Since my podcast is far from the most popular, and since most podcasts are not like mine, and do not (and should not) try to be like mine, perhaps I am not the right respondent.  Nonetheless I offered a simple formula:</p>
<p><em>A podcast really works when it is the dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>Or expressed in other words:</p>
<p><em>What makes for a good podcast is the dramatic tension between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>If you think of Russ Roberts at EconTalk, often “the story line” is something like “I am a Mensch and you are a Mensch, and we are going to talk this through together.”  In earlier times, it had more elements of “you are going to put forward some mainstream points, and I am going to push back with market-oriented economics.”</p>
<p>Many of the most famous podcasts are variants of: “We will pretend to be talking about something, but in fact we will exploring new visions of masculinity for a Woke and post-Woke world.”</p>
<p>The visual images and home pages associated with those podcasts are often so…manly.  The T-shirts!  The muscles!  It is also why those podcasts fail so badly at having significant numbers of interesting female guests, addressed on their own terms.</p>
<p>Many episodes of Conversations of Tyler are “I’m going to try to show people just how smart you are, but it will end up a wilder and more precarious ride than you might have thought.”  Occasionally a guest flunks the test (though they might still be smart).  Alternately, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/daniel-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the podcast with Daniel Carpenter</a> was the first episode of “Tyler gets upset at a guest, they really have at it!”</p>
<p>I called my podcast with David Deutsch “weird and testy” — that too is dramatic tension.  One listener <a href="https://twitter.com/jachaseyoung/status/1400254407191580672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>: “Tyler’s delight at having a guest who doesn’t hedge or mealymouth is palpable.”  Few tweeted about the substance of the disagreements.</p>
<p>One woman <a href="https://twitter.com/pupu_tintin/status/1400154143092789252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about it</a>: “Without understanding everything he said, I find myself mentally stimulated &amp; spiritually inspired. Such a purist, an idealist, a truth-seeker w/ religious zeal. Not religious myself, I could see myself eventually submit to his religion”</p>
<p>She meant Deutsch.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1413829597918121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some listeners</a> enjoy how the guests are surprised and delighted by the questions.  With <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alexander-the-grate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander the Grate</a> — the homeless guy — the question was how he would perform at all.  I thought he was excellent and very interesting, but there was real suspense leading up to that point.  “And will Tyler question him just like he does everyone else?”</p>
<p>Get the picture?  I’m not saying these listeners are indifferent to the content, rather they filter it through the unfolding story about the dialogical interaction.  I don’t know of any successful podcasts that violate this principle.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>…some very few podcasts are high level professionals in the same field, with a lot of respect for one another, exploring the space and enjoying each other’s company, especially when effectively “meeting for the first time.” I feel like this is maybe on the order of 1-5% of podcasts I hear. Most podcasts I listen to are “just” very high quality interviews</p></blockquote>
<p>My podcasts with Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss would be examples of that, and there are plenty more out there without yours truly.</p>
<p>So, to use <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansonian rhetoric,</a> “Podcasting isn’t about the podcast!”  If you are seeking to understanding a podcast, including your own, start by asking what the basic story line is.  Where the dramatic tension lies.  Do you have enough dramatic tension in what you are doing?  What is the actual reason why you are not attracting more quality guests of a particular kind?</p>
<p>I am not claiming comparable expertise, but to return to my own endeavors, they are most influenced by: Monty Python’s Flying Circus (especially the interview segments, which maintain remarkable dramatic tension), Seinfeld (wonderful ensemble work), Curb Your Enthusiasm (for how long can you keep people on edge?), and the TNT halftime show with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, etc. (what makes for a dramatic or memorable interjection?).  I doubt those are the right sources for <em>your</em> podcast, but perhaps you should look far and wide as well, rather than just listening to other podcasts.  Howard Stern is perhaps another useful source?</p>
<p>If they had had another season of Seinfeld, would Jerry have to have started (again) dating Elaine?  The dramatic stories in a podcast also need to change and evolve over time, and perhaps I will return to that topic in the future.</p>

                    <p>Worldwide, an estimated 20,000 species of wild and managed insects pollinate flowers, aiding plant reproduction<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.

</figure><p>Intensive agriculture is a multifactorial source of stress on pollinator populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Pollinating insects, such as bees, face the physiological challenge of acute or chronic harm from exposure to various agrochemicals, including fungicides and pesticides, that are used to protect crop plants. They also face nutritional stress arising from the lack of pollen- and nectar-providing wild flowers in large-scale, intensive crop monocultures<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>. Moreover, the industrial transport and use of managed high-density colonies of honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) for crop pollination can increase pollinator exposure to parasites or pathogens<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, and might result in disease spillover to wild pollinators<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>. Over the past decade, the lethal or sublethal effect of combinations of agrochemical, pathogenic or nutritional stressors on bees has been tested in many individual experiments<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter <i>et al</i>. advance this knowledge through a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of interactions between agrochemical, pathogenic and nutritional stressors on multiple aspects of bee health and fitness. Their analysis is notable because of the breadth of bee responses considered (for example, foraging behaviour, memory, mortality and colony reproduction), and for comparisons of the interactions of multiple classes of stressor (for example, agrochemical–parasite, parasite–nutrition, agrochemical–agrochemical and parasite–parasite interactions).</p><p>The authors conducted a monumental literature search that yielded almost 15,000 relevant individual studies. Siviter and colleagues combed through these publications to focus on the experiments that investigated the combined effect of parasites (microorganisms and invertebrates), agrochemicals and nutritional stressors on bee health. The authors selected studies that used a balanced and replicated experimental design, and that provided accessible data (means, standard deviations and sample sizes) for each treatment. This rigorous focus and quality control resulted in a final set of 90 studies being selected for further analysis.</p><p>These studies provide a total of 356 effect sizes (measurements indicating the magnitude of a relationship between factors of interest and a particular outcome) for different stressor and bee-response combinations. The authors accounted for data issues that might have confounded their accurate detection of bee responses. Such challenges included those arising from statistical non-independence of multiple effects reported from a single study, publication biases (for example, the lack of negative results), species skews (honey bee data sets predominated), and how experimental treatments such as pesticide dose compare with what might be realistically encountered in the field (termed field realism).</p><p>Siviter and colleagues tested whether the stressor interactions were synergistic, meaning that their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects, as would be the case if the effect of one stressor on a bee elevates the effect of another stressor. The authors also examined alternative scenarios in which the effects of multiple stressors were antagonistic (the effect of one stressor lessens the effect of another) or additive (the combined effect is equivalent to the sum of the individual effects).</p><p>A consistent message from their analysis is that bee mortality is increased by a synergistic interaction between multiple stressors — the worst-case scenario, indicating a disproportionate effect of multiple stressors on bee survival. Interactions between different agrochemicals, rather than other stressors, drove this overall effect, and this finding held true when accounting for the field realism of the agrochemical doses. This result confirms that the cocktail of agrochemicals that bees encounter in an intensively farmed environment can create a risk to bee populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">14</a></sup>. Multi-stressor interactions involving parasites and nutritional stress (including in combination with agrochemicals) produced additive effects on bee mortality overall.</p><p>The authors’ deeper analysis of the biological complexity, however, revealed large differences between particular parasite groups in terms of the full range of additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects on bee mortality, when considering interactions between different parasites or between different parasites and nutritional stress. This variability in response, together with the lower sample sizes for the interactions involving stressors other than agrochemicals, indicate a caveat to consider and also suggest a need for more research on the combined effects of biological sources of stress.</p><p>It is intriguing that Siviter and colleagues found that additive, not synergistic, effects predominated for the non-lethal effects of stressors on fitness proxies (such as modifications of bee behaviour or reproduction, changes in parasite load or immune function). Such non-lethal changes could ultimately affect bee mortality rates. Consequently, how the observed synergistic effects of agrochemicals on bee mortality arise remains to be established. More work is therefore needed to identify the mechanism that links exposure to behavioural or physiological changes and mortality.</p><p>The majority of the studies in the data set were of managed populations of <i>A. mellifera</i>, so the authors also separately analysed responses at the level of bee genus (<i>Apis</i>, <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Megachile</i> and <i>Osmia</i>). <i>Apis</i> mortality was affected by a synergistic multi-stressor interaction qualitatively similar to the full analysis of all bee genera. Other bee genera exhibited additive or antagonistic mortality responses from many fewer studies. This raises an important point. There is a need for research efforts and regulators to widen their focus from <i>A. mellifera</i> — a single, mostly managed bee species — to other pollinator model organisms, whose different ecology and evolutionary history might result in different responses to stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter and colleagues’ findings of the cumulative negative effect of multi-stressor interactions on bees reinforces the call to evaluate such interactions to avoid unforeseen risks to biodiversity and healthy ecosystems<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. In some regions of the world, regulatory risk-assessment frameworks for plant-protection products are being developed to deal with sublethal, long-term and potentially synergistic effects among stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR15" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">15</a></sup> (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track-category="body text link">go.nature.com/3f4ax5r</a>), but their biological and geographical scope must be extended. The authors acknowledge that the high levels of variability between the studies and parameters investigated demand an appropriately cautious interpretation. However, this highlights the need for worldwide reconsideration of risk-assessment approaches for pesticide regulation.</p><p>Given the widespread loss of habitat resources — such as pollen and nectar sources — from intensively managed agricultural landscapes<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>, nutritional deficits occurred surprisingly infrequently as a mechanism underlying bees’ physiological stress (they accounted for only 58 out of the 365 measurements of effect sizes). A greater consideration of how nutritional stress interacts with exposure to pathogens and agrochemicals is therefore an obvious research gap to fill. Moreover, ensuring that experimental treatments are calibrated to simulate realistic environmental conditions would greatly aid risk assessments. This might include three-way combinations of field-realistic chemical doses and parasite levels, and a spatio-temporal dietary diversity similar to that found in semi-natural or highly human-modified landscapes.</p><p>The next challenge is to look beyond these parasite–nutrition–agrochemical interactions to consider other risks to pollination. Future studies must ultimately consider, through a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, the interplay of nutrition–pathogen–agrochemical interactions alongside the effects of other human-driven changes (such as climate change, pollution, land-use changes and the spread of invasive species)<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Although such assessments would be non-trivial to carry out, they will be vital for understanding and ranking the relative risks to pollinators and pollination that are coming from multiple combinations of pressures resulting from global changes.</p>

<p>Airyx is a new open source OS project that aims to provide a similar experience and some compatibiilty with macOS on x86-64 sytems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://airyx.org/" rel="nofollow">airyx.org</a> or join us on <a href="https://libera.chat" rel="nofollow">Libera IRC</a> in <code>#airyx</code> for more info!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bedef041d3a50f0bd26c945e533853f1520330780bd617f59c49ffb10900001c/68747470733a2f2f6170692e6369727275732d63692e636f6d2f6769746875622f6d737a6f656b2f61697279782e7376673f6272616e63683d6d61696e267461736b3d6169727978"></a></p>
<p>The main design goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>source compatibility with macOS applications (i.e. you could compile a Mac application on Airyx and run it)</li>
<li>similar GUI metaphors and familiar UX (file manager, application launcher, top menu bar that reflects the open application, etc)</li>
<li>compatible with macOS filesystems (HFS+ and APFS) and folder layouts (/Library, /System, /Users, /Volumes, etc)</li>
<li>self-contained applications in <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppDir">folders</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/AppImage">single file</a> and a (mostly) installer-less experience for /Applications</li>
<li>mostly maintain compatibility with the FreeBSD base system and X11 - a standard Unix environment under the hood</li>
<li>compatible with Linux binaries via FreeBSD&#39;s Linux support</li>
<li>eventual compatibility with x86-64 macOS binaries (Mach-O) and libraries</li>
<li>pleasant to use, secure, stable, and performant</li>
</ul>

Abstract

   This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are suited
   for use as a database key.

   A common case for modern applications is to create a unique
   identifier for use as a primary key in a database table.  This
   identifier usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable
   using the monotonic creation time in the most significant bits.  In
   addition the identifier is highly collision resistant, difficult to
   guess, and provides minimal security attack surfaces.  None of the
   existing UUID versions, including UUIDv1, fulfill each of these
   requirements in the most efficient possible way.  This document is a
   proposal to update [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] with three new UUID versions that
   address these concerns, each with different trade-offs.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


<span><a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Background</span>

   A lot of things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally
   created.  Modern applications have a need to use (and many have
   already implemented) UUIDs as database primary keys.

   The motivation for using UUIDs as database keys stems primarily from
   the fact that applications are increasingly distributed in nature.
   Simplistic &#34;auto increment&#34; schemes with integers in sequence do not
   work well in a distributed system since the effort required to
   synchronize such numbers across a network can easily become a burden.
   The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique and reasonably short
   values in distributed systems without requiring synchronization makes
   them a good candidate for use as a database key in such environments.

   However some properties of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] UUIDs are not well suited to
   this task.  First, most of the existing UUID versions such as UUIDv4
   have poor database index locality.  Meaning new values created in
   succession are not close to each other in the index and thus require
   inserts to be performed at random locations.  The negative
   performance effects of which on common structures used for this
   (B-tree and its variants) can be dramatic.  As such newly inserted
   values SHOULD be time-ordered to address this.

   While it is true that UUIDv1 does contain an embedded timestamp and
   can be time-ordered; UUIDv1 has other issues.  It is possible to sort
   Version 1 UUIDs by time but it is a laborious task.  The process
   requires breaking the bytes of the UUID into various pieces, re-
   ordering the bits, and then determining the order from the
   reconstructed timestamp.  This is not efficient in very large
   systems.  Implementations would be simplified with a sort order where
   the UUID can simply be treated as an opaque sequence of bytes and
   ordered as such.

   After the embedded timestamp, the remaining 64 bits are in essence
   used to provide uniqueness both on a global scale and within a given
   timestamp tick.  The clock sequence value ensures that when multiple
   UUIDs are generated for the same timestamp value are given a
   monotonic sequence value.  This explicit sequencing helps further
   facilitate sorting.  The remaining random bits ensure collisions are
   minimal.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   Furthermore, UUIDv1 utilizes a non-standard timestamp epoch derived
   from the Gregorian Calendar.  More specifically, the Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond intervals since
   00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.  Implementations and many languages may
   find it easier to implement the widely adopted and well known Unix
   Epoch, a custom epoch, or another timestamp source with various
   levels of timestamp precision required by the application.

   Lastly, privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
   address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC addresses
   can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and reveal
   various other information about such machines (minimally
   manufacturer, potentially other details).  Instead &#34;cryptographically
   secure&#34; pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) or pseudo-random
   number generators (PRNG) SHOULD be used within an application context
   to provide uniqueness and unguessability.

   Due to the shortcomings of UUIDv1 and UUIDv4 details so far, many
   widely distributed database applications and large application
   vendors have sought to solve the problem of creating a better time-
   based, sortable unique identifier for use as a database key.  This
   has lead to numerous implementations over the past 10+ years solving
   the same problem in slightly different ways.

   While preparing this specification the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

   An inspection of these implementations details the following trends
   that help define this standard:

      - Timestamps MUST be k-sortable.  That is, values within or close
      to the same timestamp are ordered properly by sorting algorithms.
      - Timestamps SHOULD be big-endian with the most-significant bits
      of the time embedded as-is without reordering.
      - Timestamps SHOULD utilize millisecond precision and Unix Epoch
      as timestamp source.  Although, there is some variation to this
      among implementations depending on the application requirements.
      - The ID format SHOULD be Lexicographically sortable while in the
      textual representation.
      - IDs MUST ensure proper embedded sequencing to facilitate sorting
      when multiple UUIDs are created during a given timestamp.
      - IDs MUST NOT require unique network identifiers as part of
      achieving uniqueness.
      - Distributed nodes MUST be able to create collision resistant
      Unique IDs without a consulting a centralized resource.

<span><a id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Summary of Changes</span>

   In order to solve these challenges this specification introduces
   three new version identifiers assigned for time-based UUIDs.

   The first, UUIDv6, aims to be the easiest to implement for
   applications which already implement UUIDv1.  The UUIDv6
   specification keeps the original Gregorian timestamp source but does
   not reorder the timestamp bits as per the process utilized by UUIDv1.
   UUIDv6 also requires that pseudo-random data MUST be used in place of
   the MAC address.  The rest of the UUIDv1 format remains unchanged in
   UUIDv6.  See <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>

   Next, UUIDv7 introduces an entirely new time-based UUID bit layout
   utilizing a variable length timestamp sourced from the widely
   implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source.  The
   timestamp is broken into a 36-bit integer sections part, and is
   followed by a field of variable length which represents the sub-
   second timestamp portion, encoded so that each bit from most to least
   significant adds more precision.  See <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>

   Finally, UUIDv8 introduces a relaxed time-based UUID format that
   caters to application implementations that cannot utilize UUIDv1,
   UUIDv6, or UUIDv7.  UUIDv8 also future-proofs this specification by
   allowing time-based UUID formats from timestamp sources that are not
   yet be defined.  The variable size timestamp offers lots of
   flexibility to create an implementation specific RFC compliant time-
   based UUID while retaining the properties that make UUID great.  See
   <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>

   The UUID length of 16 octets (128 bits) remains unchanged.  The
   textual representation of a UUID consisting of 36 hexadecimal and

   readability.  In addition the position of both the Version and
   Variant bits remain unchanged in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv6 aims to be the easiest to implement by reusing most of the
   layout of bits found in UUIDv1 but with changes to bit ordering for
   the timestamp.  Where UUIDv1 splits the timestamp bits into three
   distinct parts and orders them as time_low, time_mid,
   time_high_and_version.  UUIDv6 instead keeps the source bits from the
   timestamp intact and changes the order to time_high, time_mid, and
   time_low.  Incidentally this will match the original 60-bit Gregorian
   timestamp source.  The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from
   their usage and position in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  The 48-bit node MUST be set
   to a pseudo-random value.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 1

<span><a id="section-4.3.3" href="#section-4.3.3">4.3.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv6 node bits SHOULD be set to a 48-bit random or pseudo-random
   number.  UUIDv6 nodes SHOULD NOT utilize an IEEE 802 MAC address or
   the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.5">[RFC4122], Section 4.5</a> method of generating a random multicast

<span><a id="section-4.3.4" href="#section-4.3.4">4.3.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The following implementation algorithm is based on [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] but with
   changes specific to UUIDv6:

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time as a 60-bit count of 100-nanosecond
        intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.

   3.   Set the time_low field to the 12 least significant bits of the
        starting 60-bit timestamp.

   4.   Truncate the timestamp to the 48 most significant bits in order
        to create time_high_and_time_mid.

   5.   Set the time_high field to the 32 most significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

   6.   Set the time_mid field to the 16 least significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   7.   Create the 16-bit time_low_and_version by concatenating the
        4-bit UUIDv6 version with the 12-bit time_low.

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp generate
        a random 14-bit clock sequence value.

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value.

   10.  Complete the 16-bit clock sequence high, low and reserved
        creation by concatenating the clock sequence onto UUID variant
        bits which take the most significant position in the 16-bit
        value.

   11.  Generate a 48-bit psuedo-random node.

   12.  Format by concatenating the 128 bits from each parts:
        time_high|time_mid|time_low_and_version|variant_clk_seq|node

   13.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   The steps for splitting time_high_and_time_mid into time_high and
   time_mid are optional since the 48-bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order as time_high_and_time_mid during the
   final concatenation.  This extra step of splitting into the most
   significant 32 bits and least significant 16 bits proves useful when
   reusing an existing UUIDv1 implementation.  In which the following
   logic can be applied to reshuffle the bits with minimal
   modifications.

<span><a id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  UUIDv7 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   The UUIDv7 format is designed to encode a Unix timestamp with
   arbitrary sub-second precision.  The key property provided by UUIDv7
   is that timestamp values generated by one system and parsed by
   another are guaranteed to have sub-section precision of either the
   generator or the parser, whichever is less.  Additionally, the system
   parsing the UUIDv7 value does not need to know which precision was
   used during encoding in order to function correctly.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 2

<span><a id="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 utilizes a 36-bit big-endian unsigned Unix Timestamp value
   (number of seconds since the epoch of 1 Jan 1970, leap seconds
   excluded so each hour is exactly 3600 seconds long).

   Additional sub-second precision (millisecond, nanosecond,
   microsecond, etc) MAY be provided for encoding and decoding in the
   remaining bits in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 SHOULD utilize a motonic sequence counter to provide
   additional sequencing guarantees when multiple UUIDv7 values are
   created in the same UNIXTS and SUBSEC timestamp.  The amount of bits
   allocates to the sequence counter depend on the precision of the
   timestamp.  For example, a more accurate timestamp source using
   nanosecond precision will require less clock sequence bits than a
   timestamp source utilizing seconds for precision.  For best
   sequencing results the sequence counter SHOULD be placed immediately
   after available sub-second bits.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  UUIDv7 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 implementations, even with very detailed sub-second precision
   and the optional sequence counter, MAY have leftover bits that will
   be identified as the Node for this section.  The UUIDv7 Node MAY
   contain any set of data an implementation desires however the node
   MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure global uniqueness.
   In most scenarios the node SHOULD be filled with pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv7 bit layout for encoding and decoding are described

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.4.1">4.4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Encoding</span>

   Since the UUIDv7 Unix timestamp is fixed at 36 bits in length the
   exact layout for encoding UUIDv7 depends on the precision (number of
   bits) used for the sub-second portion and the sizes of the optionally
   desired sequence counter and node bits.

   Three examples of UUIDv7 encoding are given below as a general
   guidelines but implementations are not limited to just these three
   examples.

   All of these fields are only used during encoding, and during
   decoding the system is unaware of the bit layout used for them and
   considers this information opaque.  As such, implementations
   generating these values can assign whatever lengths to each field it
   deems applicable, as long as it does not break decoding compatibility
   (i.e.  Unix timestamp (unixts), version (ver) and variant (var) have
   to stay where they are, and clock sequence counter (seq), random
   (random) or other implementation specific values must follow the sub-
   second encoding).

   In Figure 3 the UUIDv7 has been created with millisecond precision
   with the available sub-second precision bits.

   Examining Figure 3 one can observe:

   *  The first 36 bits have been dedicated to the Unix Timestamp
      (unixts)

   *  All 12 bits of scenario subsec_a is fully dedicated to millisecond
      information (msec).

   *  The 4 Version bits remain unchanged (ver).

   *  All 12 bits of subsec_b have been dedicated to a motonic clock
      sequence counter (seq).

   *  The 2 Variant bits remain unchanged (var).

   *  Finally the remaining 62 bits in the subsec_seq_node section are
      layout is filled out with random data to pad the length and
      provide guaranteed uniqueness (rand).

          Figure 5: UUIDv7 Field and Bit Layout - Encoding Example
                           (Nanosecond Precision)

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.4.2">4.4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Decoding</span>

   When decoding or parsing a UUIDv7 value there are only two values to
   be considered:

   1.  The unix timestamp defined as unixts

   2.  The sub-second precision values defined as subsec_a, subsec_b,
       and subsec_seq_node

   As detailed in Figure 2 the unix timestamp (unixts) is always the
   first 36 bits of the UUIDv7 layout.

   Similarly as per Figure 2, the sub-second precision values lie within
   subsec_a, subsec_b, and subsec_seq_node which are all interpreted as
   sub-second information after skipping over the version (ver) and
   (var) bits.  These concatenated sub-second information bits are
   interpreted in a way where most to least significant bits represent a
   further division by two.  This is the same normal place notation used
   to express fractional numbers, except in binary.  For example, in
   decimal &#34;.1&#34; means one tenth, and &#34;.01&#34; means one hundredth.  In this
   subsec field, a 1 means one half, 01 means one quarter, 001 is one
   eighth, etc.  This scheme can work for any number of bits up to the
   maximum available, and keeps the most significant data leftmost in
   the bit sequence.

   To perform the sub-second math, simply take the first (most
   significant/leftmost) N bits of subsec and divide it by 2^N.  Take
   for example:

   1.  To parse the first 16 bits, extract that value as an integer and
       divide it by 65536 (2 to the 16th).




<span>Peabody &amp; Davis          Expires 28 October 2021               [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr/><!--NewPage--><pre><span id="page-16"></span>
<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   2.  If these 16 bits are 0101 0101 0101 0101, then treating that as
       an integer gives 0x5555 or 21845 in decimal, and dividing by
       65536 gives 0.3333282

   This sub-second encoding scheme provides maximum interoperability
   across systems where different levels of time precision are
   required/feasible/available.  The timestamp value derived from a
   UUIDv7 value SHOULD be &#34;as close to the correct value as possible&#34;
   when parsed, even across disparate systems.

   Take for example the starting point for our next two UUIDv7 parsing
   scenarios:

   1.  System A produces a UUIDv7 with a microsecond-precise timestamp
       value.

   2.  System B is unaware of the precision encoded in the UUIDv7
       timestamp by System A.

   Scenario 1:

   1.  System B parses the embedded timestamp with millisecond
       precision.  (Less precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B SHOULD return the correct millisecond value encoded by
       system A (truncated to milliseconds).

   Scenario 2:

   1.  System B parses the timestamp with nanosecond precision.  (More
       precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B&#39;s value returned SHOULD have the same microsecond level
       of precision provided by the encoder with the additional
       precision down to nanosecond level being essentially random as
       per the encoded random value at the end of the UUIDv7.

<span><a id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  UUIDv8 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv8 offers variable-size timestamp, clock sequence, and node
   values which allow for a highly customizable UUID that fits a given
   application needs.

   UUIDv8 SHOULD only be utilized if an implementation cannot utilize
   UUIDv1, UUIDv6, or UUIDv8.  Some situations in which UUIDv8 usage
   could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp source not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp bit layout not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like a specific level of precision within
      the timestamp not offered by current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID node other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the usage of one of the current time-based UUIDs.

   Roughly speaking a properly formatted UUIDv8 SHOULD contain the
   following sections adding up to a total of 128-bits.

      - Timestamp Bits (Variable Length)
      - Clock Sequence Bits (Variable Length)
      - Node Bits (Variable Length)
      - UUIDv8 Version Bits (4 bits)
      - UUID Variant Bits (2 Bits)

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific time-based UUIDs.  To be clear:
   UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
   filled with random data.  UUIDv8&#39;s 128 bits (including the version
   and variant) SHOULD contain at the minimum a timestamp of some format
   in the most significant bit position followed directly by a clock
   sequence counter and finally a node containing either random data or
   implementation specific data.

   A sample format in Figure 6 is used to further illustrate the point
   for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv8.

                   Figure 6: UUIDv8 Field and Bit Layout

   timestamp_32:
      The most significant 32 bits of the desired timestamp source.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3).

   timestamp_48:
      The next 16-bits of the timestamp source when a timestamp source
      with at least 48 bits is used.  When a 32-bit timestamp source is
      utilized, these bits are set to 0.  Occupies bits 32 through 47

   ver:
      The 4 bit UUIDv8 version (1000).  Occupies bits 48 through 51.

   time_or_seq:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp is used these 12-bits are used
      to fill out the remaining timestamp.  If a 32 or 48-bit timestamp
      is leveraged a 12-bit clock sequence MAY be used.  Together ver
      and time_or_seq occupy bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   var:
      2-bit UUID variant (10)

   seq_or_node:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp source is leverages these 8 bits
      SHOULD be allocated for an 8-bit clock sequence counter.  If a 32
      or 48 bit timestamp source is used these 8-bits SHOULD be set to
      random.

   node:
      In most implementations these bits will likely be set to pseudo-
      random data.  However, implementations utilize the node as they
      see fit.  Together var, seq_or_node, and node occupy Bits 64
      through 127 (octets 8-15)

<span><a id="section-4.5.1" href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a>.  UUIDv8 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv8&#39;s usage of timestamp relaxes both the timestamp source and
   timestamp length.  Implementations are free to utilize any
   monotonically stable timestamp source for UUIDv8.

   Some examples include:

      - Custom Epoch
      - NTP Timestamp
      - ISO 8601 timestamp

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   The relaxed nature UUIDv8 timestamps also works to future proof this
   specification and allow implementations a method to create compliant
   time-based UUIDs using timestamp source that might not yet be
   defined.

   Timestamps come in many sizes and UUIDv8 defines three fields that
   can easily used for the majority of timestamp lengths:

   *  32-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and setting timestamp_48 to
      0s

   *  48-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and timestamp_48 entirely

   *  60-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq

   *  64-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq and truncating the timestamp the 60 most significant
      bits.

   Although it is possible to create a timestamp larger than 64-bits in
   size The usage and bit layout of that timestamp format is up to the
   implementation.  When a timestamp exceeds the 64th bit (octet 7),
   extra care must be taken to ensure the Variant bits are properly
   inserted at their respective location in the UUID.  Likewise, the
   Version MUST always be implemented at the appropriate location.

   Any timestamps that does not entirely fill the timestamp_32,
   timestamp_48 or time_or_seq MUST set all leftover bits in the least
   significant position of the respective field to 0.  For example a
   36-bit timestamp source would fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits
   of timestamp_48.  The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set
   to 0.

   By using implementation-specific timestamp sources it is not
   guaranteed that devices outside of the application context are able
   to extract and parse the timestamp from UUIDv8 without some pre-
   existing knowledge of the source timestamp used by the UUIDv8
   implementation.

<span><a id="section-4.5.2" href="#section-4.5.2">4.5.2</a>.  UUIDv8 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   A clock sequence MUST be used with UUIDv8 as added sequencing
   guarantees when multiple UUIDv8 will be created on the same clock
   tick.  The amount of bits allocated to the clock sequence depends on
   the precision of the timestamp source.  For example, a more accurate
   timestamp source using nanosecond precision will require less clock
   sequence bits than a timestamp source utilizing seconds for
   precision.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 generically defines two possible clock
   sequence values that can leveraged:

   *  12-bit clock sequence using time_or_seq for use when the timestamp
      is less than 48-bits which allows for 4095 UUIDs per clock tick.
   *  8-bit clock sequence using seq_or_node when the timestamp uses
      more than 48-bits which allows for 255 UUIDs per clock tick.

   An implementation MAY use both time_or_seq and seq_or_node for clock
   sequencing however it is highly unlikely that 20-bits of clock
   sequence are needed for a given clock tick.  Furthermore, more bits
   from the node MAY be used for clock sequencing in the event that
   8-bits is not sufficient.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.5.3" href="#section-4.5.3">4.5.3</a>.  UUIDv8 Node Usage</span>

   The UUIDv8 Node MAY contain any set of data an implementation desires
   however the node MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure
   global uniqueness.  In most scenarios the node will be filled with
   pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 defines 2 sizes of Node depending on
   the timestamp size:

   *  62-bit node encompassing seq_or_node and node Used when a
      timestamp of 48-bits or less is leveraged.
   *  54-bit node when all 60-bits of the timestamp are in use and the
      seq_or_node is used as clock sequencing.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   An implementation MAY choose to allocate bits from the node to the
   timestamp, clock sequence or application-specific embedded field.  It
   is recommended that implementation utilize a node of at least 48-bits
   to ensure global uniqueness can be guaranteed.

<span><a id="section-4.5.4" href="#section-4.5.4">4.5.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The entire usage of UUIDv8 is meant to be variable and allow as much
   customization as possible to meet specific application/language
   requirements.  As such any UUIDv8 implementations will likely vary
   among applications.

   The following algorithm is a generic implementation using Figure 6
   and the recommendations outlined in this specification.

   *32-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to all 0s

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (time_or_node) to 0

   7.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (time_or_node).

   8.   Set the variant to binary 10

   9.   Generate 62 random bits and fill in 8-bits for seq_or_node and
        54-bits for the node.

   10.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   11.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *48-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
       bits.

   3.  Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 most significant bits
       from the timestamp

   4.  Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 least significant bits from the
       timestamp

   5.  The rest of the steps are the same as the previous example.

   *60-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 middle bits from the timestamp

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   Set 12-bit time_or_node to the 12 least significant bits from
        the timestamp

   7.   Set the variant to 10

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (seq_or_node) to 0

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (seq_or_node).

   10.  Generate 54 random bits and fill in the node

   11.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

   12.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *64-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.  The same steps as the 60-bit timestamp can be utilized if the
       64-bit timestamp is truncated to 60-bits.

   2.  Implementations MAY chose to truncate the most or least
       significant bits but it is recommended to utilize the most
       significant 60-bits and lose 4 bits of precision in the
       nanoseconds or microseconds position.

   *General algorithm for generation of UUIDv8 not defined here:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as desired
       bit total

   3.  Set total amount of bits for timestamp as required in the most
       significant positions of the 128-bit UUID

   4.  Care MUST be taken to ensure that the UUID Version and UUID
       Variant are in the correct bit positions.

       UUID Version: Bits 48 through 51

       UUID Variant: Bits 64 and 65

   5.  If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted) or
       the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
       desired clock sequence value to 0

   6.  If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
       or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
       value.

   7.  Set the remaining bits to the node as pseudo-random data

   8.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits together

   9.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to the
       stable store

<span><a id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Encoding and Storage</span>

   The existing UUID hex and dash format of 8-4-4-4-12 is retained for
   both backwards compatibility and human readability.

   For many applications such as databases this format is unnecessarily
   verbose totaling 288 bits.

   *  8-bits for each of the 32 hex characters = 256 bits
   *  8-bits for each of the 4 hyphens = 32 bits

   Where possible UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database applications as
   the underlying 128-bit binary value.

<span><a id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Global Uniqueness</span>

   UUIDs created by this specification offer the same guarantees for
   global uniqueness as those found in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  Furthermore, the
   time-based UUIDs defined in this specification are geared towards
   database applications but MAY be used for a wide variety of use-
   cases.  Just as global uniqueness is guaranteed, UUIDs are guaranteed
   to be unique within an application context within the enterprise
   domain.

<span><a id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Distributed UUID Generation</span>

   Some implementations might desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve 2 or more applications independently
   generating UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  UUIDs
   already feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of
   collision are low.  However, implementations MAY dedicate a portion
   of the node&#39;s most significant random bits to a pseudo-random
   machineID which helps identify UUIDs created by a given node.  This
   works to add an extra layer of collision avoidance.

   This machine ID MUST be placed in the UUID proceeding the timestamp
   and sequence counter bits.  This position is selected to ensure that
   the sorting by timestamp and clock sequence is still possible.  The
   machineID MUST NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address.  The creation and
   negotiation of the machineID among distributed nodes is out of scope
   for this specification.

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span><a id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and MUST not be used for
   node generation.  As such they have been strictly forbidden from
   time-based UUIDs within this specification.  Instead pseudo-random
   bits SHOULD selected from a source with sufficient entropy to ensure
   guaranteed uniqueness among UUID generation.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with the clock sequence does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and it&#39;s corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>]
   UUIDv4 SHOULD be utilized.

   The machineID portion of node, described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, does provide
   small unique identifier which could be used to determine which
   application is generating data but this machineID alone is not enough
   to identify a node on the network without other corresponding data
   points.  Furthermore the machineID, like the timestamp+sequence, does
   not provide any context about the data the corresponds to the UUID or
   the current state of the application as a whole.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
        
                
                                                    
            <p>When it comes to internet speed tests, <a href="https://www.ookla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Speedtest</a> is the gold standard. So when Ookla examined its data for <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Starlink</a> and its satellite internet rivals, <a href="https://www.hughesnet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">HughesNet</a> and <a href="https://www.viasat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Viasat</a>, the numbers it comes up with are meaningful. </p>
		    

                        
    	<p>To no great surprise, <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-hughesnet-viasat-performance-q2-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla found Starlink beats HughesNet and Viasat handly</a>. The company found that &#34;Starlink was the only satellite internet provider in the United States with fixed-broadband-like latency figures, and median download speeds fast enough to handle most of the needs of modern online life at 97.23 Megabits per second (Mbps) during Q2 2021. HughesNet was a distant second at 19.73 Mbps and Viasat third at 18.13 Mbps.&#34;</p><p>As for latency, the time between when you start an activity over the internet and when you get a response back, it&#39;s not even a competition. Starlink&#39;s median latency, 45 milliseconds (ms) is close to fixed broadband&#39;s 14 ms. Low latency is vital for voice and video calling, gaming, and live content streaming. By comparison, Viasat, 630 ms, and HughesNet, 724 ms, are almost unusable for these purposes. </p><p>Why was there such a huge difference? It&#39;s simple physics. Unless we ever get <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-unveils-blueprint-quantum-internet-launch-future-quantum-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">quantum networking</a>, we can&#39;t network faster than the speed of light. Starlink uses low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, flying above us at a relatively close 550 to 1,200 kilometers (km), while HughesNet and Viasat have far higher geosynchronous orbits of about 35,000km.</p><p>Of course, even Starlink isn&#39;t as fast as cable or fiber-based internet. According to Ookla, the median fixed-broadband in the US is 115.22Mbps with a latency of 15ms. But, Starlink was never meant to compete with Earth-bound internet in cities and suburbs. It&#39;s meant to offer an alternative to people living in the country. There I know people who are still using -- yes, I&#39;m serious -- dial-up modems and slow-as-dirt DSL connections with speeds that go all the way down to Kilobits per second (Kbps). </p><p>For these users, Starlink is clearly the better choice. But, Starlink is still being rolled out. This means some places at some times get much better performance than others. Ookla found at the top were users in Morgan county, Alabama at 168.30 Mbps, while lagging more than 100 Mbps behind were the residents of Madison County, Indiana.</p><p>Generally speaking, due to how the Starlink satellite constellations are currently set up, the farther North you live, the better your connection. But, as Morgan county shows, that&#39;s not a hard and fast rule. For example, in Canada Starlink&#39;s median download speed of 86.92 Mbps exceeded the country&#39;s median fixed broadband speed of 84.24 Mbps. </p>

    
<p>In other countries, such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom Starlink&#39;s speed vastly beats terrestrial internet speeds. In France, Starlink&#39;s download speed 139.39 Mbps, easily outran the country-wide fixed broadband average speed of 70.81 Mbp. With Germany, the difference is even larger. A German internet user can expect to see a Starlink speed of 107.98 Mbps while its Earth-bound competitors come in at 58.17 Mbps. While in the UK, and not just in those areas of Scotland far away from the usual internet providers, Starlink&#39;s 108.30 Mbps beats fixed broadband, 50.14 Mbps, hollow. Of course, in all cases, Starlink&#39;s latency will be slower than its territorial competitors. You can&#39;t beat physics. </p><p>You might be wondering how HughesNet and Viasat can stay in business. The reason for that is simple. They&#39;re the only internet game in town in many countries. For instance, in Brazil, Viasat&#39;s 60.30 Mbps download speed is comparable to fixed broadband&#39;s 61.38 Mbps. If you live in the campos, the countryside, you can get Viasat, where you may not have a practical alternative. </p><p>But, while Starlink may sound wonderful, its manufacturing lines are still lagging far behind demand. I, for instance, have yet to see my Starlink Terminal and I ordered it almost six months ago. </p><p>In theory, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">Starlink will be available around the world by September.</a> In practice, I&#39;m not counting on it. </p><p>Is Starlink for everyone? No. But, if you live beyond the reach of conventional high-speed internet or areas with poor general internet service, you&#39;ll want to try to get it. Once in hand, it&#39;s clearly the best satellite internet service.</p><p><strong>Related Stories:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/starlink-satellite-internet-how-does-it-work-cost-features-speed/">Starlink: Elon Musk&#39;s satellite internet explained</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">SpaceX president says Starlink global satellite broadband service to be live by September</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ins-and-outs-of-starlink-internet-from-the-sky/">The ins and outs of Starlink: Internet from the sky</a></li></ul>

    (1,072 miles) across two days to see her for the first time since Covid started.  I was happy to see Mom, happy about the first road-trip in a
    long time, and happy to have tested the hypothesis that, in 2021, a fully-electric vehicle can handle long-haul travel.</p>

<p>My Mom, welcoming us to Saskatchewan. Normally she doesn’t look like the queen.</p>
<p>This essay gathers together the data from the trip and tries to draw
    conclusions. There’s also a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/timbray/status/1422578253835821058">real-time Twitter thread</a> with typos and bad pictures.</p>

<p>To my non-metric readers: Sorry, it’s in km.  I’ll convert a few of the key numbers.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>The experience</span> · 
It was pretty wonderful, actually.  The Jaguar is a comfortable modern car with great seats, good audio, and all the
    automation you’d expect.  It has awesome, overwhelming acceleration power for when you’re in a tricky passing situation.
    My daughter was excellent company.
    Cruising along a good road<span> —</span> and a lot of the Trans-Canada highway
    is<span> —</span> becomes a pretty pleasing experience.</p>

<p>The worst part, by a wide margin, was the wildfire smoke, between us and some of the
    world’s most fantastic scenery.  But that’s a symptom of the onrushing climate crisis, and one of the best things we can do to
    mitigate the devastation is to stop burning fossil fuels to travel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_135917188.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Smoky sun while charging in West Hills Mall, Calgary</p>
<p>Of course, this road trip was different from any previous experience, because charging.  In a fossil car, you don’t have to think,
    you just wait for the tank to get a half or three quarters down, then pull over at the next station.  Recharging requires
    planning; fortunately the tools are pretty good; more on that below.</p>

<p id="p-9"><span>The chargers</span> · 
One reason I decided this experiment was worth trying was Petro-Canada’s message about their
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Electric Highway</a> program, and I quote: “We
    have a charger every 250 km or less from Halifax, N.S. to Victoria, B.C.” There’s one not far from where I live in Vancouver, i
    tried it, and it worked first time with just a credit-card tap, no fuss no muss.</p>

<p>Trouble is, that quote is kind of a lie. There are gaps, and that’s when all the chargers are working, which fairly regularly
    they’re not. But my experience is that Petro-Can, while good, is never your only charging option.</p>

<p>Some background is required here. “High-power” Fast DC chargers come at multiple power levels: I saw 50, 100, 200, and
    350kW. The difference makes a difference.  Our Jag can only really charge at 100kW, but my personal perception is that the
    higher-power chargers fill up that last 20% much faster.  And it feels complicated; for example, in my
    experience with a Co-op Connect charger, rated at “only” 100kW, it felt faster.</p>

<p>When you use these things, they feel like first-generation tech, pushing the edges of what’s possible (or at least
    maintainable). In particular, when you plug a 350kW charger into a car with a really low battery, once it’s finished syncing and
    starts pumping electrons, the sound torques up like a 747 taking off.  And the installations include multiple big tall metal
    boxes (see the picture below).  Also, the huge big thick connecting wire gets super hot to the touch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_041820412.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Charging can be glamorous!</p>
<p>Anyhow, my impression of the Petro-Can network remains mostly positive. The machines work well.  It’s annoying that some are
    100kW, some 200, and some 350, for no obvious reason. It’s annoying that sometimes they’re stuck into a weird grubby back corner of the
    lot in a way that makes it hard to get your car in the right position to reach the charging port with the wire.  But, good on
    ’em.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electrify-canada.ca">Electrify Canada</a> is another organization that’s promising a national network of
    fast chargers. They’re a partner of Electrify America, constructed by Volkswagen as part of their settlement over cheating on
    emissions testing. Anyhow, maybe they’ll be great some day. Once I was far enough into the trip to have Petro-Can fully worked
    out, I tried to find an Electrify charger in working condition but failed.</p>

<p>If you’re OK with using 50kW chargers there are loads and loads of options. Many smaller-town Visitor Centres and and
    Chambers of Commerce put one in, as has my own electrical utility, BC Hydro.  Once you’ve worked with a higher-power charger
    though, they’re just not a satisfying experience.</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>The numbers</span> · 
Each line in the table below represents one driving leg and includes the charging experience at the beginning of that leg (thus absent
    on each day’s initial leg). I think the column headings are mostly pretty obvious, except perhaps
    for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>kWh/h</b> is the amount of juice divided by the driving pause. Often the charger would report less time, which I put down
    to initialization delay, so I think I’m using the right value. The variation here is a little random, because how fast it goes
    depends strongly on how empty your battery is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>km/ch</b> stands for “km per charge-hour”, estimating the amount of road range you
    get per hour of charging. Which I think is a really important number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Network</b>; “PC” is
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Petro-Canada</a>, “Flo”
    <a href="https://www.flo.com/en-CA/">isn’t an acronym</a>, and “Co-op” is
    <a href="https://www.fuel.crs/more/electric">Co-op Connect</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two data sources: The drive-time data is from Jaguar’s trip logging via their
    <a href="https://incontrol.jaguar.com/">Incontrol</a> app; thus the awkwardness caused by non-charge roadside stops.
    The charge-time data is the output from the various charging sessions along the way.  I’m
    certain that neither is perfect, but the results seem intuitively in the right neighborhood, based on my experience.</p>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at the numbers that seem interesting to me.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Charge time</span> · 
17:42 driving, 6:24 charging (including one evening charge after the day’s drive was finished).  Not that great on the face
    of it. Now, it clearly could have been less; since my confidence 
    that any given charger would Just Work started out weak, I was carefully allowing for failures and not running the battery
    very low. Later on in the trip as I gained confidence (specifically in the Petro-Canada network) I was willing to take on things
    like the Calgary-to-Medicine Hat leg, 2:43 and 285.9km, running the battery from 90% down to 11%.</p>

<p>Also my daughter is after all a teen-ager, and perhaps not quite as quick as I moving through cafes
    and restrooms and so on.</p>

<p>Also note that the legs are kind of short; this car can go 400km on a charge. But not when you’re on a big wide modern
    Prairie highway with almost no other traffic, blasting along at 110km/h (65mph) or more, continuously. I think you’d find this
    true of pretty well every electric vehicle.</p>

<p>But, here’s the thing: It didn’t <em>feel</em> excessive. I can only remember a total of maybe fifteen minutes when we were
    consciously just hanging waiting for charge. Most places, we got a coffee or lunch, hit the bathroom, took a walk around the block
    for our knees’ sake, and then it was time to unplug and go.</p>

<p>Having said that, this is a 2019 model-year car and the charging technology is improving. If we’d had a
    Porsche Taycan and nothing but 350kW chargers, the story would have been very different.  Will the fast-charging technology make the leap
    into the mainstream-car price plane? Will 350kW chargers become ubiquitious? I’d like to know.</p>

<p>In this context, there’s another number there that I think is really interesting: The “km/c-h”, how far you can get on an
    hour’s charge. For this particular car on this selection of chargers, it was over 200km (124 miles) per charge-hour.  I think
    that’s enough? Maybe in the lower regions of enough, but there.</p>

<p>And finally, I suspect every driving-safety professional would beam in approval of a power system that forces you to get out
    of the car and move around every couple of hundred km.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>$$$</span> · 
It cost us $120.52 in electricity. Is that a lot or a little?  I tentatively think they’re undercharging. While the
    electricity itself is pretty cheap, the charging infrastructure isn’t. If this is going to work, the charging networks are going
    to have to make money and I don’t see it at these prices.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that at home with the Level 2 charger in the carport, charging feels close to free. Travel maybe doesn’t need to be as
    cheap as the networks are currently making it.</p>

<p>Also, charging by the minute seems wrong. I guess having a time-based component makes sense to keep slow chargers from
    soaking up all the time, but especially at an extra-high-powered charger, a Porsche Taycan is going to get a whole lot more
    range out of each minute than a five-year-old Nissan Leaf, so why should they pay less for the same amount of range? Hmmmm.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>PlugShare</span> · 
If you’ve got a Tesla there’s less planning, the cars know where the Superchargers are.  If you have anything else, you really need
    <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a>.  There are a few apps in this space, but PlugShare is best at showing
    you a map with all the chargers on it, and thus helping you route-plan.  The reason it works is because it’s social; whenever
    you hit a charging station you can “Check In” and leave a note saying whether it’s working and how fast it goes.  This
    dramatically reduces the risk of rolling up to a station and finding it broken.     I absolutely
    don’t think this journey would have been possible without it. </p>

<p>Pro tip: When you’re planning a trip on PlugShare, put in <em>all</em> the chargers you might be able to use as you go along. Then
    when you’re driving, you can look at your remaining range and your upcoming options and most choices become pretty easy.  It’s
    got a limited but decent Android Auto app that I used a lot. (I assume CarPlay too?)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210803_154006840.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Jaguar I-Pace and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_Mach-E">Mustang Mach-E</a> charging up in Hope, BC.</p>
<p id="p-6"><span>Futures</span> · 
A question: Are there enough chargers, or too many?  At the moment, the answer is probably “too many”. One of the things I really
    worried about was limping into some charging station to find all the chargers occupied and having to wait for an hour
    before I could even start.  The picture above shows the only time I saw other humans; a young couple with a
    four-day-old Mustang Mach-E, off for a joyride to Kamloops.  Otherwise, the chargers we visited showed no signs of
    life. Somebody spent a lot of money to build an expensive resource that is today largely un-used.</p>

<p>Having said that, anyone with even a shred of optimism about our future has to believe there are going to be a whole lot more
    battery-electric cars coming. Here in BC at the west edge of Canada we have
    <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/b-c-tops-north-america-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-2020-says-minister">North
    America’s highest EV uptake</a>, pushing 10% of new car sales.</p>

<p>When we were charging at the big Petro-Can station in Kamloops, walking from the the two well-positioned chargers to the
    coffee shop, we went by the gas-sales part, which was <em>massive</em>, at least a dozen pumps and cars lined up for every
    one.</p>

<p>At some point that picture will flip, and there’ll be occasional vendors that still sell gas, but mostly just 
    slick, fast, chargers.  I worry that the process will be kind of painful, but I’m sure it’ll happen. So I hope someone’s
    planning the transition.</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Would you do it again?</span> · 
Definitely.</p>

<p>And everyone should stop driving fossil vehicles starting now. Because the climate crisis is upon us. We can’t prevent it now, but we can save
    lives and reduce destruction if we slash carbon output. There’s no excuse not to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Homeless residents of a state-run tent city in Honolulu, Hawaii, are having their eyes scanned by a robotic police dog.</p><p>Police in the city say it&#39;s a safer way to check for symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>But local civil rights advocates say the use of the robot – called Spot – dehumanises some of Honolulu&#39;s most vulnerable residents.</p><p>&#34;Because these people are houseless it’s considered OK to do that,” said Jongwook Kim, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii. “At some point it will come out again for some different use after the pandemic is over&#34;.</p><h2>&#39;COVID safe&#39;</h2><p>Acting Lt. Joseph O’Neal of the Honolulu Police Department’s community outreach unit defended the robot’s use in a media demonstration earlier this year.</p><p>He said it had protected officers, shelter staff and residents by scanning people’s body temperatures at a shelter where they could quarantine and get tested for COVID-19.</p><p>The robot is also used to remotely interview individuals who have tested positive for the virus.</p><p>&#34;We have not had a single person out there that said, ‘That’s scary, that’s worrisome,’&#34; O’Neal said. &#34;We don’t just walk around and arbitrarily scan people&#34;.</p><p>Police use of such robots is still rare and largely untested — and hasn’t always gone over well with the public.</p><p>Honolulu officials faced a backlash when a local news organisation, Honolulu Civil Beat, revealed that the Spot purchase was made with federal relief money.</p><h2>Public outcry in New York</h2><p>Late last year, the New York Police Department started using Spot after painting it blue and renaming it &#34;Digidog&#34;. It went mostly unnoticed until New Yorkers began spotting it in the wild and posting videos to social media.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the department returned the robot to its manufacturer.</p><p>&#34;This is some Robocop stuff, this is crazy,&#34; was the reaction in April from Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman.</p><p>He was one of several New York politicians to speak out after a widely shared video showed the robot strutting with police officers responding to a domestic-violence report at a high-rise public housing building in Manhattan.</p><p>Days later, after further scrutiny from elected city officials, the department said it was terminating its lease and returning the robot.</p><p>The expensive machine arrived with little public notice or explanation, public officials said, and was deployed to already over-policed public housing. Use of the high-tech canine also clashed with Black Lives Matter calls to defund police operations and reinvest in other priorities.</p><p>In the aftermath of the fiasco, Boston Dynamics, the company that makes the robots, Boston Dynamics, said it needed to do a better job of explaining the technology to the public and customers who have had little experience with it.</p><h2>&#39;Just a tool&#39;</h2><p>For the Dutch national police, one of the company’s customers, explaining the technology includes emphasising that Spot is a very good robot — well-behaved and not so smart after all.</p><p>&#34;It doesn’t think for itself,&#34; Marjolein Smit, director of the special operations unit of the Dutch national police, said of the remote-controlled robot. &#34;If you tell it to go to the left, it will go to the left. If you tell it to stop, it will stop&#34;.</p><p>Earlier this year, her police division sent its robot into the site of a deadly drug lab explosion near the Belgian border to check for dangerous chemicals and other hazards.</p><p>According to Boston Dynamics, its acceptable use guidelines prohibit Spot’s weaponisation or anything that would violate privacy or civil rights laws, which it said puts the Honolulu police in the clear ethically.</p><p>It&#39;s all part of a year-long effort by the company, which in the past relied on military funding, to make its robots seem friendlier and thus more palatable to local governments and consumer-oriented businesses.</p><h2>Military-grade</h2><p>By contrast, a lesser-known rival, Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, has no qualms about weaponisation and supplies its dog-like robots to several branches of the US military and its allies.</p><p>&#34;It’s just plug and play, anything you want,&#34; said Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh, who was critical of Boston Dynamics’ stated ethical principles as &#34;selective morality&#34; because of the company’s past involvement with the military.</p><p>Parikh added that his company doesn’t market its four-legged robots to police departments, though he said it would make sense for police to use them.</p><p>&#34;It’s basically a camera on a mobile device,&#34; he said.</p><p>There are roughly 500 Spot robots now in the wild. Perry said they&#39;re commonly used by utility companies to inspect high-voltage zones and other hazardous areas. Spot is also used to monitor construction sites, mines and factories, equipped with whatever sensor is needed for the job.</p><p>It’s still mostly controlled by humans, though all they have to do is tell it which direction to go and it can intuitively climb stairs or cross over rough terrain. It can also operate autonomously, but only if it’s already memorised an assigned route and there aren’t too many surprise obstacles.</p><h2>Should the police have robots?</h2><p>&#34;The first value that most people see in the robot is taking a person out of a hazardous situation,&#34; Michael Perry, vice president of business development at Boston Dynamics, said.</p><p>Kim, of the ACLU in Hawaii, acknowledged that there might be many legitimate uses for such machines, but said opening the door for police robots that interact with people is probably not a good idea.</p><p>He pointed to how Dallas police in 2016 stuck explosives on a wheeled robot to kill a sniper, fueling an ongoing debate about &#34;killer robots&#34; in policing and warfare.</p><p>&#34;There’s the potential for these robots to increase the militarization of police departments and use it in ways that are unacceptable,&#34; Kim said.</p><p>&#34;Maybe it’s not something we even want to let law enforcement have&#34;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dating in Delhi when you&#39;re poor</title>
      <link>https://www.reuters.com/article/delhi-dating-idUSKBN1DU0NE</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article dir="ltr"><div><p>Anuradha starts her day washing dishes, cups and cutlery in Sarita Vihar, one of New Delhi’s more affluent neighbourhoods. It is one of six apartments that she cleans every day. She mops floors, scrubs bathroom tiles, takes out the garbage and sweeps and wipes the apartment stairs.</p><figure><p><figcaption>People are silhouetted against the setting sun at a park in New Delhi March 10, 2010. REUTERS/B Mathur/Files</figcaption></p></figure><p>She likes to talk to herself while she works. Her employers joke about it, but it’s one way to get through the tedium that comes with spending the work day with her back bent over or on her haunches.</p><p>She meets her boyfriend on Saturdays. That’s her day off, she said as she mopped my apartment stairs. Where do they go? I asked her. What do they do?</p><p>“We generally go to a place which is far from my home. I borrow my employer’s cellphone to call him and decide our plans,” she said.</p><p>She’s the first woman from her family who makes her own money. They’re from Bihar, hundreds of miles to the east, and they’re conservative. In the capital, she prefers wearing jeans and short-sleeved kurtas like the “Delhi girls,” who they see at bus stops and on the metro trains; the ones who go to college and work in offices and set the fashion trends for a growing population of people from the countryside who are looking for work in India’s big cities.</p><p>Unlike those girls and so many other, richer people in Delhi, she and her boyfriend don’t have an option to go out for a date to places that most people who would read this story would go. The 23-year-old earns 8,000 rupees a month ($125) for her work. That’s what her employers can expect to pay for a single “date night” out at one of the city’s finer restaurants.</p><p>Delhi has a per capita annual income of 300,000 rupees ($4,615) - the highest in the country and three times the national average. But nearly half of the city’s population lives in slums without basic services and facilities like drinking water, garbage disposal or a proper drainage system.</p><p>These aren’t the people you will meet out at what online restaurant listing service Zomato calls a typical “romantic dinner” for a couple in Delhi, where the cost for two usually starts at 3,000 rupees ($47) and goes as high as 10,000 ($155), depending on where you go. A movie date with snacks can cost somewhere around 2,500 rupees to an upper-middle class couple.</p><p>For poor people, going on a date requires setting different expectations. Money, where to go and what to do, coupled with a lack of privacy in a densely populated place make for rendezvous that are no less romantic, but decidedly different from what many young people around the world consider a “date.”</p><p>Anuradha usually takes a bus to go to Kalindi Kunj Park or the ruins of the Tughlaqabad fort, both around four kilometres from her home, and that’s where she meets her boyfriend for dates. She lives in one-room flat in the Jhuggi Jhopri colony – a settlement developed by the city government near the easternmost edge of Delhi for poor people as an alternative to illegal slums.</p><p>“I don’t really want any expensive gifts, or to go to big restaurants. These things are superficial,” said Anuradha, who said she likes watching romance movies and is a big Shah Rukh Khan fan.</p><p>When she and her boyfriend meet, they talk about their lives and walk around the park, or eat aloo-chaat or golgappas at a roadside stall. Mostly, the boyfriend, who works as a helper at a general-provision store, pays the bill.</p><p>Then there is the story of Surender and Preeti.</p><p>“We used to gift each other colorful dhaga (sacred threads) or lockets bought from roadside vendors, meet each other on terraces in our colony and convey our messages through our younger cousins or mutual friends,” Surender said. “We used to meet in desolate lanes and ask the younger ones to be on a lookout. That was what we termed as a date. It was years before I took her to have a burger at a McDonalds’ outlet in Connaught Place. It cost me 60 rupees.”</p><p>Surender used to ask Preeti to meet him at a meeting point far from their homes. Dressed up in his best clothes, some cheap jeans and a shirt from counterfeit brands bought from Palika Bazaar, and wearing cologne, his priority was to plan their dates in a way to avoid Delhi’s infamous “eve-teasers,” men who sexually harass women on the street with leers, catcalls and often ironic serenades of lyrics from famous Bollywood film songs.</p><p>“I first saw her in a jagrata (all-night prayer ritual) in my colony and knew she was made for me. Though we used to stare at each other daily, I had to wait for another nine years before I could gather the courage to talk to her. I thought she was too beautiful to be with someone like me.”</p><p>Surender, now 30, won her heart through his romantic poetry.</p><p>Twelve years after they started dating, they married. The family disapproved. Surender’s grandmother and Preeti’s mother were from the same “gotra,” or clan. Hindu clans prohibit marriage within the descendants of an unbroken male line. (Marrying within the “gotra” is one of the primary reasons for recurring “honour killing” of lovers in India.)</p><p>The couple used to meet each other however they could — by bus, auto rickshaw and on foot. “I had a slightly well-off friend from whom I used to borrow clothes, money and often his bike. We never went to malls as everything there was out of my budget. I was also afraid that they would throw us out because we couldn’t speak English.”</p><p>The biggest problem for such couples is a space to meet. Between gossiping neighbours and disapproving family members, not to mention the ubiquitous “aunties,” (middle-aged women) dating can require one immediate commitment: taking the time to go somewhere far from where you live. Often, the destinations are Delhi’s parks.</p><p>Buddha Jayanti Park, Lodhi Gardens, Deer Park, Millennium Indraprastha Park, the Garden of Five Senses and Kalindi Kunj Park are some of the most popular “lovers’ parks”.</p><p>Tucked in the corners or behind the bushes are couples from different parts of the city; kissing or cozying up to each other under a shawl or a bedsheet. In the background in some parks are old Muslim tombs and gumbads (domes), trees and flower gardens, some stray dogs, children at play, old people taking their daily walks alongside tourists, and picnicking families. Everyone learns to take a peek and look away when they see a boy and girl à deux.</p><p>But even poor lovers face a tough crowd.</p><p>“Looks like all the dirt of the city assembles here only,” says a man sitting with his wife and three children under a tree in the Kalindi Kunj Park against the backdrop of the Delhi Eye, a 200-foot-tall ferris wheel.</p><p>Arun believes it’s the man’s persistence to woo them that matters to most women. “People from my strata don’t have the option to trust anyone quickly. How much a person can wait is ultimately the sign of their interest. We don’t swipe each other on apps,” he says while pointing to a cheap smartphone in his hand.</p><p>Even though China-made affordable smartphones are making inroads among India’s poor people, dating apps such as Tinder remain the province of wealthier people because of the social stigma associated with dating and premarital sex.</p><p>“High-profile people like you can go to restaurants or hotels. We have just parks”, says Arun, an 18-year-old commerce student. “Even places like McDonald’s are an option for the ones who have some cash. Most of my friends just take their girls to parks and treat them with jhalmuri (puffed rice mixed with spices). The girls also don’t have that many expectations.”</p><p>Arun sometimes gives his girlfriend a ring bought from the roadside or a simple greeting card, which cost around 10 to 20 rupees.</p><p>He also takes his girlfriend to parks and to the movies, but only on Thursdays when the ticket prices are cheapest as the demand for them generally dwindles on last day before the next film releases on Friday. The matinee shows on these “slow” days cost 100 to 150 rupees, and are usually cheaper than the evening shows on weekends – reaching up to eight times than what Arun pays. They refrain from buying overpriced snacks at the concession stands.</p><p>“A few people I know have collected money to give their girlfriends a mobile phone to talk to them. If the girl’s family gets to know about the secret phone, she gets beaten up by her parents,” he said. “The braver ones run away from home with their lovers. Every once in a while, these stories end up in suicides.”</p></div></article></div></div><p><span data-name="for-phone-only">for-phone-only</span><span data-name="for-tablet-portrait-up">for-tablet-portrait-up</span><span data-name="for-tablet-landscape-up">for-tablet-landscape-up</span><span data-name="for-desktop-up">for-desktop-up</span><span data-name="for-wide-desktop-up">for-wide-desktop-up</span></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Other Invisible Hand</title>

<p>Economics and evolution are basically in the same business: Both are all about productivity selection, though one has been at it for billions of years longer than the other. Both involve “invisible hand” magic — intricate, unplanned, “self-organizing” systems. Unfortunately, economics hasn’t kept up with what natural scientists have discovered about life’s organizing secrets. Nevertheless, economic ideas rule our lives, so it’s critical we apply Leslie Orgel’s second law (“evolution is cleverer than you”) specifically to economics. </p>



<p>For instance, it may surprise many non-biologists to learn that evolution isn’t only about red-in-tooth-and-claw competitive selfishness — it’s also “ruthlessly cooperative.” And protecting life-supporting cooperation requires suppressing certain kinds of selfishness. Biologists, unlike many economists, grasp when the “greed is good” ethos gets deadly.</p>



<p>There’s no real argument about the fact that “the evolution of cooperation is central to all living things.” That’s the first line of a Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334008521_Enforcement_is_central_to_the_evolution_of_cooperation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">paper</a> by the biologists Nicholas Davies, Kevin Foster and Arvid Ågren, and it expresses an utterly uncontroversial view among biologists. The paper examines a “central puzzle”: “Why does evolution favor investment in cooperation rather than self-serving rebellion that would undermine a particular genome, organism or society?” Surely a topic of central concern to economists also. The authors present abundant “evidence that enforcement shapes cooperation across all levels of biology.” Enforcement is defined as “action that evolves … to reduce selfish behavior within a cooperative alliance.” Adding to copious real-world cases, modeling shows that whenever “new selfish elements are introduced to a population, the evolution of suppression is often rapid.” Otherwise, gains from selfishness get ruinously risky. </p>



<p>These evolutionary lessons aren’t related to the two main flavors of critiques of economics that typically command attention. This isn’t about deviations from “rationality” or “market failures.” No matter how perfectly rational imaginary market participants are in responding to fully loaded local incentives, the systemic effects of self-organization are often far from benign. In biology, they’re routinely collectively ruinous. Only certain kinds of self-organizing complex systems enable collectively beneficial results. And billions of years of R&amp;D have taught biology which tricks work.   </p>



<p>Life necessarily operates a Russian doll-like nested hierarchy of cooperation, where selfishness-suppressing enforcement operates at every level. We might call this “coop-cop policing.” </p>

</div>




<p>Every so-called selfish gene also cooperates with the other genes in its genome — the gene team that collectively builds and (co)operates their “survival vehicle” (a.k.a. body). Every complex cell is powered by cooperation (their power plant subcomponents, chloroplasts or mitochondria, result from symbiosis). Every multi-cellular organism is a collaborative “<a href="file:///C:/%20https:/www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2017/11/27/the-philosophy-of-social-evolution-part-4/" data-wpel-link="internal">society of cells</a>.” Group-living species form varying degrees of super-organisms where survival is influenced by the fitness of group mates (social groups become a looser, but often no less necessary, form of extended survival vehicle). And cross-species collaborations abound (symbiosis isn’t rare — it’s the rule). Indeed, as David Haskell, a biologist and writer, notes, a tree is “a community of cells” from many species: “fungus, bacteria, protist, alga, nematode and plant.” And often “the smallest viable genetic unit [is] … the networked community.”</p>



<p>Amazingly, you don’t even need a brain to reap the benefits of being ruthlessly cooperative. Microbes collaborate extensively, for instance in providing biochemical “public goods,” which are predictably protected by coop-cop policies that prevent exploitative free or cheap riding (although we should bear in mind that this is an anthropomorphic analogy, since none of the microbial players has a mind or intentions). The scientific consensus has shifted so much that Richard Dawkins, in the 30th-anniversary edition of “The Selfish Gene,” wrote that he could just as accurately have called his book “The Cooperative Gene.” Perhaps decades of our economic and political lives would have been much less harmful if he had. </p>



<p>A very instructive case of how greed is not good, of self-interest run amok, is cancer. Tumors are a form of cell-level selfishness that all organisms must do their darnedest to suppress. As Athena Aktipis, author of “The Cheating Cell,” and several other evolutionary biologists explain in a 2015 <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0219" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, a defining trait of traitorous cancer cells is that they gain in fitness “at the expense of the organism.” They can’t help but make explicit market parallels, describing two revealingly named cancer strategies as “demographic cheating” and “economic cheating.” Cancer cells cheat on their body’s biological social contract. </p>



<p>Every viable bio-social contract in multi-cellular organisms must enforce this rule: The health of the whole must trump the self-interest of any part. Otherwise, the parts become parasitic, gaining at the expense of the viability of the whole. Unregulated parts can kill their wholes. </p>



<p>Humans are obligated cooperators: To survive, we have no choice but to cooperate with other humans. Indeed, the evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson calls teamwork humanity’s “<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530061-100-what-makes-us-altruistic-and-whats-it-good-for/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">signature adaptation</a>.” We are evolution’s most productive super-cooperators — our economies are our social metabolism, facilitating our techno-political form of globe-spanning super-cooperations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ideas most economists use have been too influenced by “methodological individualism,” rather than the more scientifically supported view of us as a super-social, super-cooperative, intensely interdependent species. Often, this economics-style individualism is of the Thomas Hobbes variety, which paints humans in “a state of nature,” waging a “war of all against all.” </p>



<p>But this influential image and logic is bad science and utterly untrue (and a terrible basis on which to build on the Enlightenment’s ideas about political and economic systems). Charles Darwin wrote an entire book about humans being social creatures. He wrote that any Hobbesian human would be an “unnatural monster.” And contrary to that science-denying slogan of Margaret Thatcher’s, that “there is no such thing as society,” no human has ever survived or thrived without a tribe or society. As Wilson <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/focus-article/reaching-a-new-plateau-for-the-acceptance-of-multilevel-selection/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">puts it</a>, “What made our ancestors different was the ability to collectively suppress … disruptive behaviors within the group, so that cooperating … became the dominant survival strategy.”</p>



<p>Division of labor in biology’s cooperations creates “<a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/the-cheating-cell-an-interview-with-athena-aktipis/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">fitness interdependence</a>.” That’s Aktipis’s term for a mode of joint interests that doesn’t rely on relatedness or reciprocity, the previously popularized ways to explain the evolution of unselfish behaviors (a.k.a. altruism). Once collaboration evolves to be more productive than solo strategies, the game changes — you now need your co-laborers to survive and thrive also. Again, lessons surely sorely needed for a fitter economics and wiser politics. </p>



<p>Speaking of such lessons, Wilson and John Gowdy <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269637211_Human_ultrasociality_and_the_invisible_hand_foundational_developments_in_evolutionary_science_alter_a_foundational_concept_in_economics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">write</a>, “the invisible hand metaphor can be justified … for humans in addition to nonhuman species, [only] when certain conditions are met.” Space precludes the details, but what matters is that this contrasts sharply with core economic assumptions and teachings. As Wilson <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/the-third-way-of-entrepreneurship-in-the-internet-age-a-conversation-with-tim-oreilly/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">explains</a>, the “problem with laissez-faire in all its forms … [is] it is simply profoundly untrue that lower-level agents pursuing their narrow interests — whether an individual, a small firm or a leviathan like Google — robustly benefit the common good.“</p>



<p>Biology’s invisible hand knows better. It has tested over billions of years a mind-bogglingly vast variety of super-complex cooperations — and religiously, rigorously, ruthlessly weeded out the many self-organizing setups that aren’t productive enough or that create collective catastrophe. </p>



<p>We need economic and political equivalents to the evolutionary wisdom of these life-wide logic patterns. For instance, policies that mimic tumor-suppressor genes and coop-cop processes that suppress unenlightened selfishness.  This will require a wholesale revision to the regulation-reviling reflexes of free-marketeers. As Wilson quips, “an unregulated organism is a dead organism.” We need ways to detect and suppress parasitic gains — for example, massive corporations like Amazon that pay zero taxes towards the upkeep of the infrastructure their profits depend on, or likewise billionaires who pay lower tax rates than nurses.</p>

<p>We must explicitly protect our Russian-doll nested survival vehicles: communities, cities, nations, all the way up to the whole planetary biosphere. Our coop-cop policies must prevent us, or others, from gaining by harming any of those. Evolution teaches that without these, collective collapse awaits. </p>



<p>Instead, sadly, current capitalism too often mimics the logic of cancer — unconstrained greed-is-good games have metastasized throughout our body politic. And economists routinely call behaviors “rational” that produce predictably collectively painful or bad outcomes, and which evolution would suppress (like the sado-capitalist backfiring “rationality” that counsels against cooperating in “prisoner’s dilemmas,” or greedy co-suicidal tactics in “tragedy of the commons” cases, which the political scientist Elinor Ostrom showed are solved easily in many cultures not ruled by the ideas of economists).  </p>



<p>In one way, all this should be obvious — ever been on a team? And this logic pattern has been expressed in many ways; in Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America,” which has a chapter called “How the Americans Combat Individualism by the Principle of Interest Rightly Understood.” Despite our ambient certainty that it is natural, Tocqueville describes individualism as a newfangled phenomenon. The word “individualism” itself entered the English language largely through translations of his work. Somehow, our leaders are educated into the error of dangerously discounting this “enlightened self-interest” (also a term Tocqueville invented). </p>



<p>It is in no one’s real interest to weaken or wreck what they (or their descendants) need to survive. This can be spelled out in 15 words, and could be called “needism”: Know your needs. Don’t damage what supplies them. Don’t let others either — or you’re doomed. Cultures either heed the logic of needism, or they perish.</p>



<p>Much popularization work remains to put newer evolutionary lessons on par with pop-science selfish-gene logic. But billions of years of harsh testing have taught all living systems to suppress certain sorts of disruptive selfishness. Economists should reflect long and hard on why the systems they study would be any exception. These yet unnamed natural law patterns limit even what evolution can sustain. </p>



<p>It’s time we hired the other invisible hand explicitly to support the common good. And we need coop-cop regulations of selfishness at every level to avoid parts harming their needed wholes. Otherwise, harsh karma awaits as our co-fate for allowing a plague of parasitic plutocratic plundering.</p>

      <title>Making Sierra Pay</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
														<div id="attachment_4760"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/set-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4760"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-4760">Scenes from the <em>Phantasmagoria</em> set, with Roberta Williams in pride of place at center.</p></div>
<p>At the conclusion of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">my previous article</a> on Sierra Online’s corporate history, we saw how Ken and Roberta Williams moved their company’s headquarters from the tiny Northern California town of Oakhurst to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, home to Microsoft among others, in September of 1993. They did so for a mixture of personal and professional reasons, as Ken has since acknowledged. Their children were getting older, for one thing, and the schools in Oakhurst were far from world-class. Additionally, life in general as the biggest fish of all in the fishbowl of a company town that Oakhurst had become wasn’t always pleasant; for example, Ken has claimed that his kids were at times bullied by “the children of former Sierra employees who had a grudge against Sierra.” Some other former employees suspect still another reason for the move to Bellevue, one that Ken neglects to mention: the fact that Washington State had no personal income tax, while California’s was the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Still, there are no grounds to doubt that the public reason Ken gave for the move back in the day was indeed a major part of the calculation: the need to recruit the sort of seasoned business talent that could take Sierra to the next level. The company’s annual revenues had grown every single year since 1987, more often than not substantially, and this was of course wonderful. But less wonderful was the fact that profits had never been as high as that progression would imply; Sierra had a knack for spending almost every dime they earned. Of late in fact, the bottom line had dipped sharply into loss territory even as revenues continued their steady climb. Under pressure from his shareholders, Ken Williams realized that he had to find a way to make his company start to pay off. He believed that doing so must entail assembling the kind of top-flight management team which could only be found in a big city. He’d been seeking a rock star of a chief financial officer for a long time from Oakhurst to no avail. Ken Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had hired a San Francisco-based company, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, to lead the search, and after months of getting nowhere I called my contact at Heidrick in frustration. “Why do you keep sending me B and C level candidates?” I asked. I was tired of having my time wasted interviewing candidates who were not at the level I was seeking. The answer came back without hesitation: “Ken, you’re aren’t getting it. No A player wants to move to Oakhurst.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nine months after the move to Bellevue, Ken finally found his rock star in the form of one Mike Brochu, a financial whizz who had spent the last nineteen years working for Burlington Resources. The man whom Ken still describes as “probably the best hire I ever made” was a garrulous Texan who “inspired confidence in everyone around him.” Not coincidentally, Sierra began to display a newly hard-nosed, bottom-line-focused attitude toward their business from virtually the moment of his arrival. As one of his first projects, Brochu led the negotiations that resulted in the sale of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/02/the-sierra-network">The ImagiNation Network</a>, Sierra’s visionary but perpetually money-losing online-gaming service, to AT&amp;T for $40 million in cash in November of 1994.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sierra implemented a significant shift in their product-development strategy. For many years now, the heart of the company’s identity had been a set of long-running adventure-game series, most of which worked the word “quest” somewhere into their title. Dodgy from the standpoints of both writing and design though they sometimes were, they’d all displayed enough lovable qualities to worm their way into fans’ hearts. I’ve described in earlier articles how Sierra fandom could feel like belonging to a big extended family. These games, then, were the cousins whom you could always expect to see at the family reunion every couple of years, dressed perhaps a bit differently than last time around but always the same person at bottom. They were comfortingly predictable, and that was exactly how the fans liked them.</p>
<p>But for all that these ramshackle, puzzle-heavy adventure games were good at cementing the loyalty of the already converted, they were less equipped to unleash the sort of explosive growth Sierra was now after. It was a pivotal moment in the history of the personal computer, as Ken Williams and Mike Brochu well recognized. In 1994, more home computers would be sold than televisions, as consumers, tempted by the ease of use of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/08/doing-windows-part-9-windows-comes-home">Microsoft Windows</a>, the magic of multimedia, and rumors of a thing called the World Wide Web, jumped onboard the computing bandwagon in staggering numbers. These people didn’t know a <em>King’s Quest</em> from an <em>Ultima</em>. Reaching them would require a different sort of game: fresher, <em>hotter</em> in the Marshall McLuhan sense, more in tune with what they were seeing on television and at the movies. It seemed like it was now or never for Sierra to capture their interest, even if it meant that some of the old fans were left feeling a bit abandoned.</p>
<p>So, Sierra’ new Bellevue management team took a hard look at their existing series in order to decide which were expendable and which were not. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/07/the-unmaking-and-remaking-of-sierra-on-line"><em>King’s Quest</em></a>, the company’s longstanding flagship series, which already enjoyed a measure of name recognition outside the traditional computer-gaming ghetto, would have been an obvious keeper even if it hadn’t been the baby of Roberta Williams. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards"><em>Leisure Suit Larry</em></a> also had proven appeal with non-traditional demographics, and was thus also a no-brainer to keep around. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/splendid-isolation-sierra-at-mid-decade"><em>Space Quest</em></a> was an edge case, but the managers decided to green-light one more game, if only to throw a bone to the old-school fans. But <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/chief-gates-comes-to-oakhurst-a-cop-drama"><em>Police Quest</em></a> would get revamped from a line of adventure games into a line of tactical 3D action games, while <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/so-you-want-to-be-a-hero"><em>Quest for Glory</em></a> would get the axe entirely. Going forward, the main focus would be on bigger-budget adventures employing filmed human actors, for which Sierra was now building their own sound stage down in Oakhurst at considerable cost. They would make fewer of this new type of adventure, but each of them would be a flashy, high-fidelity production, able to appeal to a mass market weaned on big-screen televisions and CD players. The idea was to make the release of each Sierra adventure from now on a real <em>event</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transition from one product strategy to another came with a pitfall: it would take some time to bring it off, meaning that 1994 would be an unusually quiet year in terms of new games. And that reality, combined with the new management team’s more hard-nosed attitude, meant that some of the folks in Oakhurst must lose their jobs. Among them were Corey and Lori Cole, the husband-and-wife team behind <em>Quest for Glory</em>, who saw their roles cancelled along with the fifth game in their series, the most impressive of all the series in the Sierra lineup in terms of design ambition and innovation. Corey recalls a scene which made it all too clear to everyone present that Sierra was now being run as a business, not a family: “All employees in the meeting were handed envelopes; about half of them contained ‘pink slips’ notifying them that they no longer worked for Sierra. Those employees were escorted back into the building and watched as they retrieved personal belongings from their desks.” Layoffs are never easy. Corey especially remembers the sight of Gano Haine, who had worked on Sierra’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/the-sierra-discovery-adventures">two <em>EcoQuest</em> games and <em>Pepper’s Adventures in Time</em></a>, standing in the parking lot crying: “Sierra had been her dream, and she was so thrilled to have gotten the job there.”</p>
<p>During this year of wrenching transition, Sierra released just one new Oakhurst-built adventure game, making it their least prolific year in that respect in almost a decade. Thankfully for the bean counters, the game in question was the latest installment in Sierra’s most bankable adventure series of them all. <em>King’s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride</em> was a typical entry in a series that had been Sierra’s ever-evolving technological showpiece since 1984. But then, that description in itself implies innovation on at least a technical front, and this the new entry certainly delivered.</p>
<div id="attachment_4788"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/kqvii/" rel="attachment wp-att-4788"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-4788">The <em>King’s Quest VII</em> opening movie. Ken Williams has often said that Walt Disney was one of his biggest role models. With <em>King’s Quest VII</em>, this influence became almost distressingly literal.</p></div>
<p>Although it did not employ filmed actors, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> was indicative in another way of Sierra’s new direction: rather than an interactive movie, it aimed to be an interactive cartoon worthy of comparison to the likes of Disney, an ambition which required it to look beyond Sierra’s own stable of talented in-house artists for some of its visuals. Ken Williams first reached out to an up-and-coming animation studio known as Pixar. He even spoke personally with Steve Jobs, Pixar’s chairman and majority owner, but in the end the studio proved to be simply too busy working on <em>Toy Story</em>, their first full-length feature film, to take on this task as well. So, Sierra ended up contracting sequences out to no fewer than four other outside animation studios, in addition to employing their own artists to create what truly was an audiovisual extravaganza by the standards of its time. <em>King’s Quest VII</em> went full Disney, as Charles Ardai described in his review for <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>I tried this game on my mother (a big fairy-tale fan), who asked, “Is that a game from Disney?” When I replied in the negative, she said, “But they’re trying to do Disney, right?”</p>
<p>They are indeed. From the opening frames, where drops of dew in an enchanted forest drop on the tummy of an enchanted ladybug, to the scene a few seconds later in which lovely Princess Rosella sings her royal heart out in a tuneful paean to her about-to-be-lost adolescence, King’s Quest VII exudes Disney-like quality from each of its cel-animated poses.</p>
<p>Every frame is beautiful, every line is neat and pert, the camera soars and glides, and the notes of the musical score tinkle out in bounding effervescence like the fizz out of a bottle of soda pop. This is the Disney of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin, if you deduct that film’s adult-targeted sense of irony. It’s the Disney of The Sword in the Stone and of Alice in Wonderland, light and fluffy as a soufflé. It’s not the Disney of Bambi or Snow White; here even the menaces are adorable bits of whimsy. If the villains ever frighten, it’s only for a brief time, and then everyone gets together again for one more song.</p>
<p>It matters not at all that the game is from Sierra rather than Disney. It is true to the Disney spirit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with the mouth-watering new look, the game showed some welcome design evolution over Robera Williams’s earlier work. Four years after LucasArts’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/03/monkey-island-or-how-ron-gilbert-made-an-adventure-game-that-didnt-suck"><em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em></a> had pointed the way, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> finally managed to free itself from the countless hidden dead ends that had always made playing a Roberta Williams game feel like playing make-believe with a sadist. Player deaths, on the other hand, were still copious, and still so unclued as to be essentially random, but were now at least relatively painless. Rather than expecting you to save every five minutes, the game was now kind enough to return you to the point you were at before you were so foolish as to look at the wrong thing or dilly-dally in the wrong room a second too long. In fact, save files as such disappeared altogether; exiting the game now automatically bookmarked your progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/727675-roberta-williams-king-s-quest-vii-the-princeless-bride-dos/" rel="attachment wp-att-4761"></a></p>
<p>These changes all existed in the name of making the game more welcoming to brand new players, out of the hope that they could be convinced to give it a try despite the ominous Roman numeral after its name. To further emphasize that this was a kinder, gentler <em>King’s Quest</em>, it used a radically simplified interface built around a one-click-does-it-all mouse cursor. More oddly, Sierra made it possible to play any of its chapters at any time, meaning you could start with the climax and work backward to the prologue if you were so inclined. (The real point of this feature, of course, was to let you watch each chapter’s opening movie without having to get your hands dirty with the actual game, if you happened to be one of the many people who typically bought each new <em>King’s Quest</em> as a tech demo for their latest computer.)</p>
<p>But alas, in other ways this latest entry really was just another <em>King’s Quest</em>. The writing from Roberta Williams and Lorelei Shannon, her latest apprentice co-designer, was the usual scattershot blend of fairy-tale and pop-culture ephmera, lacking sufficient wit or imagination to be all that compelling even as pastiche, while the puzzle design was made less infuriating than usual only by the lack of dead-player-walking situations. Both the writing and the puzzles got noticeably worse as the game wore on, evidence perhaps of a lead designer who was feeling increasingly bored with her big series, and was in fact already working on her next, very different game. All of this was doubly disappointing coming on the heels of <em>King’s Quest VI</em>, a game which had seemed to herald a series that was at last beginning to take its craft a bit more seriously. Even the much-vaunted look of <em>King’s Quest VII</em>, although impressive in its individual parts, made for a rather discordant jumble when taken in the aggregate, being the work of so many different teams of animators.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>King’s Quest VII</em> sold very well upon its release in November of 1994, as games in the series always did. Meanwhile Dynamix, the most consistent of Sierra’s subsidiary studios, delivered solid performers in the non-adventure games <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/aces-of-the-deep"><em>Aces of the Deep</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/front-page-sports-football-pro-95"><em>Front Page Sports: Football ‘Pro 95</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/metaltech-earthsiege"><em>Metaltech: EarthSiege</em></a>. Most of all, though, it was the ImagiNation windfall that turned what would otherwise have been an ugly year into one that actually looked pretty good on the bottom line: $83.4 million in revenues, up from $59.5 million in 1993, with an accompanying $12 million profit, in contrast to an $8.6 million loss the previous year. Now it was up to the new product strategy to keep the party going in 1995.</p>
<p>The first big test of that strategy was to be the game that Roberta Williams had been working on concurrently with <em>King’s Quest VII</em>. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> would take full advantage of the Oakhurst sound stage Sierra had just built. It was to be a play against type worthy of any pop diva: Roberta, the family-friendly “queen of adventure gaming,” was going <em>dark</em> <em>and</em> <em>sexy</em>. “With <em>Phantasmagoria</em>,” wrote Sierra’s marketers, “Roberta Williams has created a superbly written interactive story, fraught with horror and suspense, and totally in the player’s control at all times.” Bill Crow, the mastermind of Sierra’s new sound stage, believed that “<em>Phantasmagoria</em> is going to open the market to a much broader audience of game players. We’re now starting to deliver an audiovisual experience that’s much closer to what the average consumer can relate to.” With <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, in other words, computer games were about to burst out of their nerdy ghetto to become sophisticated entertainments for discerning adults.</p>
<p>How times do change. Today <em>Phantasmagoria</em> is more or less a laughingstock, a tidy microcosm of everything that was wrong with the full-motion-video era of adventure games. In truth, some of its bad rap is a bit exaggerated; it’s not really any worse than dozens of other similarly dated productions of the mid-1990s. Certainly plenty of other games had equally cheesy acting, equally clueless writing, and equally trivial gameplay. <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s modern reputation for hilarious ineptitude stems to a large extent from its mainstream prominence in its heyday. The wave of hype that Sierra unleashed, much of it issuing from the mouth of Roberta herself, is catnip for snarky reviewers like yours truly, who can’t help but throw it all back in her face. “I want to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions,” Roberta said. But <em>Phantasmagoria</em> is so very, very much not that kind of game. If you squint just right, you can see what she was trying to create: a game of claustrophobic psychological horror, an interactive version of <em>The Shining</em>. But alas, nobody involved had the chops to pull it off.</p>
<p><em>Phantasmagoria</em> revolves around a couple of artsy newlyweds named Adrienne and Don, a novelist and a photographer respectively. As the story begins, they’ve just moved into a rambling old mansion on a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of New England. They’re the first people to attempt to live in the house, we soon learn, in almost a century. The last person to do so before them was a strange stage magician named Carno the Magnificent, who went through pretty young wives at a prodigious rate — all of them abruptly disappearing from the island, never to be seen again. In the end, Carno himself disappeared, and that was that for the house until our heroes turn up. It comes as a surprise to absolutely no one except them when the place turns out to be haunted by a malevolent spirit. It quickly begins to take over the mind of Don, leaving Adrienne, the character the player controls, to try to sort out the mystery before her husband murders her like Carno killed all of his wives.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly in light of Sierra’s mass-market aspirations, they never attempted to hire “name” actors for <em>Phantasmagoria</em> in the way that Origin Systems was <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/03/wing-commander-iii">doing at the time for the <em>Wing Commander</em> franchise</a>. The role of Adrienne went to Victoria Morsell, whom Sierra rather ambitiously described as a “film, TV, and theater star,” having apparently confused bit parts with starring ones. Still, she does a decent job within the awkward constraints of her task. David Homb in the role of Don, on the other hand, is just awful; his wooden performance comes off as more creepy before the horror starts, when he’s trying to play a loving husband and failing at it abjectly, than it does after his head starts metaphorically spinning around. The rest of the cast is a similarly mixed bag.</p>
<p>Sierra hired a director named Peter Maris, with a long run of schlocky ultra-low-budget films behind him, for a shoot that wound up taking fully four months. Even given that his oeuvre wasn’t exactly of Oscar caliber, his complete disregard for pacing is bizarre. <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s seven CDs — yes, <em>seven</em> — are filled with interminable sequences where Adrienne disassembles a brick chimney piece by piece, or breaks through a wooden door board by board, or applies her morning makeup layer by agonizing layer. Indeed, Adrienne insists on stopping and preening herself at each of the many mirrors in the house throughout the game, and we’re forced to watch and wait while she does so, hoping against hope that something interesting might happen this around. (For all of Roberta Williams’s status as a female pioneer in a male-dominated industry, her games’ view of gender isn’t always the most progressive.) All of this, combined with the clumsy, overly wordy script, makes the game seem much longer than the few hours it actually takes to play. There’s a (bad) 90-minute horror flick worth of plot-advancing footage here at the best; Sierra could easily have ditched three of the seven CDs without losing much at all.</p>
<p>The much-vaunted “adult” content is rather less than it’s cracked up to be. The opening movie includes the least sexy sex scene in the history of media. Ken Williams says that it was originally to have shown Adrienne topless, but Sierra lost their nerve in the end: “When it came time to release the game, we edited it to only show some side boob.” Given how weird and awkward it already is, we can only be thankful for their last-minute fit of prudishness.</p>
<p>Nor is the game remotely scary, although it does get gruesome — a very different quality — from time to time. These sequences come when Adrienne is visited by visions of the murders that took place long ago in the different rooms of the house, or, in the latter stages of the game, when she herself meets an unfortunate end thanks to a failure on the player’s part. For better or for worse, the methods of murder might just be the most creatively inspired parts of the game: Carno kills one wife by sticking a funnel into her mouth and stuffing disgusting offal down her throat, another by shackling her into a machine that twists her head around until her neck snaps, while Adrienne can get her head sliced in two by an axe blade or her face literally ripped off by a demon. These scenes are certainly gross and shocking in their way, but it’s all strictly B-movie-slasher fare rather than the <em>Shining</em> vibe Roberta was going for.</p>
<p>The scene which prompts by far the most discussion today takes place out of the blue one morning, when Don creeps up behind Adrienne at her bedroom mirror and proceeds to… well, to rape her. Needless to say, this is a disturbing place for even an adults-only game to go. Roberta Williams is hopelessly out of her writerly depth here; in contemporary interviews, she seems utterly oblivious to the real trauma of rape, describing the scene as nothing more than a plot device to show Don’s descent into evil. Its one saving grace is the fact that no one involved is up to the task of making the rape seem remotely realistic; Don humps and thrusts a bit without ever actually taking his boxer shorts off, and that’s that. (One can only hope that Sierra didn’t shoot a more explicit version of this scene…) Afterward Adrienne, rather in contrast to Roberta’s stated desire to explore “deep emotions,” just cleans herself up and gets on with her day, apparently none the worse for wear. Even amidst the more lackadaisical sexual politics of 1995, the scene prompted considerable discussion and a measure of public outrage here and there. Australia’s Office of Film and Literature Classification refused to accept the game because of it, with the result that it was effectively banned from sale in that country.</p>
<p>So much for <em>Phantasmagoria</em> the movie. In terms of gameplay, it isn’t up to all that much at all. Its reliance on canned snippets of static video dramatically limits the scope of its interactivity, while its determination to be as accessible as possible means that all of its puzzles are broadly obvious; a version of that tired old adventure saw, the locked door with a key in the keyhole on the other side and a handy nail and newspaper, is about as complicated as things ever get. The simplified interface from <em>King’s Quest VII</em> makes a return, it’s once again possible to play the chapters in any order you choose, and bookmarks once more replace save files in the game’s terminology, although it is at least possible to make your own bookmarks whenever you like now.</p>
<p>In a way, all of this is a blessing: it lets you power right on through <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, laughing at it all the while, without getting hung up on the design flaws that dog most of Roberta Williams’s games. I’m not generally a fan of high camp, but even I could probably enjoy <em>Phantasmagoria</em> with the right group of friends. If ever a game was ripe for the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> treatment, it’s this one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Every article was sure to mention the game’s budget of fully $4 million, an absolutely astronomical sum by the standards of the time, and one which Sierra too trumpeted for all it was worth in their advertising. In truth, much of that money had gone into the building of the Oakhurst sound stage that Sierra planned to use for many more games, but no one was going to let such details get in the way of a headline about a $4 million computer game. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> became a massive hit; its sales soared past the magic mark of 1 million units and just kept right on going. It was a perfect game to take home with a shiny new computer, the perfect way to show your friends and neighbors what your new wundermachine could do. The window of time in which a game like this could have success on a scale like this was to prove sharply limited, but <em>Phantasmagoria</em> managed to slip through behind <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-full-motion-video-consulting-detective"><em>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective</em></a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/04/the-7th-guests-new-clothes"><em>The 7th Guest</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success"><em>Myst</em></a> just before said window slammed shut. It would prove the last such sparkling success among its peculiar species of game.</p>
<p>But what a success it was while it lasted. <em>Phantasmagoria</em> still stands as the best-selling game ever released by an independent Sierra. Small wonder that Ken and Roberta Williams both remember it so fondly today. Rather than a laughingstock, they remember <em>Phantasmagoria</em> as a mainstream-press darling and chart-topping hit, and love it for that. Thus Ken continues to describe it as “awesome,” while Roberta still names it as her favorite of all the games she made. It was all too easy in 1995 to believe that <em>Phantasmagoria</em> really was the future of gaming writ large.</p>
<p>The Oakhurst folks finished three other adventure games that year, with more mixed commercial results. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-quest-6-roger-wilco-in-the-spinal-frontier"><em>Space Quest 6</em></a>, which was made with a lot of the traditional Sierra style but without a lot of enthusiasm from upper management, validated the latter’s skepticism when it failed to sell all that well, signifying the end of that series. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/torins-passage"><em>Torin’s Passage</em></a>, a workmanlike fantasy adventure in the <em>King’s Quest</em> mold by Al Lowe of <em>Leisure Suit Larry</em> fame, was another mediocre performer, one whose reason for existing at all at this juncture was a little hard to determine. Finally, the second of the new generation of Sierra adventures, built like <em>Phantasmagoria </em>around filmed actors, was <em>The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery</em>. I’ll return to it in my next article.</p>
<p>Yet Oakhurst was no longer the be all, end all of Sierra. In the new corporate order envisioned by Ken Williams and Mike Brochu, the adventure games that came out of Oakhurst were to be only a single piece of the overall Sierra puzzle. They planned to build an empire from Bellevue that would cover all of the bases in consumer-oriented software. Already over the course of the previous half-decade, Sierra had acquired the Oregon-based jack-of-all-trades games studio Dynamix, the Delaware-based educational-software specialist Bright Star, and the artsy French games studio Coktel Visions. Now, in the first year after Brochu’s hiring, they made no fewer than six more significant acquisitions: the Texas-based Arion Software, maker of the recipe-tracking package MasterCook; the Washington-based Green Thumb Software, maker of Land Designer and other tools for gardeners; the British Impressions Software, maker of a diverse lineup of strategy games; the Massachusetts-based Papyrus Design Group, a specialist in auto-racing simulations; the Washington-based Pixellite Group, the maker of Print Artist, a software package for creating signs and banners; and the Utah-based Headgate Studios, a specialist in golf simulations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay/238070-trophy-bass-windows-front-cover/" rel="attachment wp-att-4759"></a></p>
<p>Of all the other products Sierra released in 1995, the one that came closest to matching <em>Phantasmagoria</em>‘s success came from good old reliable Dynamix. “I was in a high-level meeting,” remembers Dynamix’s founder Jeff Tunnell, “and the sales manager for all of Sierra said, ‘These fishing games are selling in Japan on the Nintendo.’ Everybody started laughing. But I said, ‘I’ll do one.&#39;” Like <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/trophy-bass"><em>Trophy Bass</em></a> was consciously designed for a different demographic than the typical computer game; it looked more at home on the shelves of Walmart than Electronics Boutique or Software Etc. It shocked everybody by outselling all other Sierra games in 1995, with the exception only of Roberta Williams’s big adventure, becoming in the process the best-selling game that Dynamix ever had or ever would make. Thanks to it, the later 1990s would see a flood of other fishing and hunting games, most of them executed with less love than <em>Trophy Bass</em>. Hardcore computers gamers scoffed at these simplistic knockoff titles and the supposed simple-minded rednecks who played them, but they sold and sold and sold.</p>
<p>Along with <em>Phantasmagoria</em> and other Sierra products like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/the-incredible-machine"><em>The Incredible Machine</em></a>, <em>Trophy Bass</em> provided proof positive that there were any number of new customer bases out there just waiting to be tapped, made up of people who were looking for something a bit less demanding of their time and energy than the typical computer game for the hardcore, with themes other than the nerdy staples of science fiction, fantasy, and military simulations. Whatever his faults and mistakes — you know, those ones which I haven’t hesitated to describe at copious length in these articles — Ken Williams realized earlier than most that these people were out there, and never stopped trying to reach them, even as he also navigated the computer-game market as it was currently constituted. For this, he deserves enormous credit.</p>
<p>As Sierra came out of 1995, he had good reason to feel pleased with himself. Revenues had nearly doubled over those of the previous year, to $158.1 million, and even all of the acquisitions couldn’t prevent the company from clearing over $16 million in profits. With Electronic Arts, the only publisher of consumer software with equal size and clout, now investing more and more heavily in console games, Sierra seemed to stand on the verge of complete dominance of the exploding marketplace for home-computer software. Ken’s longstanding dream of selling software to <em>everyone</em> was so close to fruition that he could taste it. And as for Roberta: her own dream of becoming the Steven Spielberg of interactivity seemed less and less far-fetched each day.</p>
<p>If you had told the pair that Roberta would never get the chance to make another point-and-click adventure game, or that the Oakhurst sound stage would be written off as a colossal blind alley and decommissioned within the next few years, or that neither of them would still be working for Sierra by that point, or that Sierra’s Oakhurst branch as a whole would be shuttered well before the millennium… well, they would presumably have been surprised, to say the least.</p>

<p>Nothing anyone says on Clubhouse matters. The whole point of Clubhouse is to be seen. It doesn’t matter who speaks or what they say. It matters that they are seen as high status people.</p>



<p>Clubhouse rose to prominence when no one could be seen in person. Everyone was stuck in their homes. Someone with a high reputation, credibility, or value to a group couldn’t flex their status in person. They couldn’t brag in person about the work they were doing, signal how smart they were, or tell you about their role at some cool company. Clubhouse was a way to be seen with other high status people, especially in circles like tech and crypto.</p>



<p>Now that high status people can be seen in person again, they are spending less time on Clubhouse. Lower status people are left trying to be seen amongst themselves. Without high status people, Clubhouse is not serving its purpose of helping people be seen. It is a cargo cult: low status people recreating the actions of high status people, after they have left, thinking it will cause them to be high status.</p>



<h2><strong>The Relics Left Behind</strong></h2>



<p>The relics of the status games are in the design. Even before you enter a room, Clubhouse shows you the people you follow in it. A user can judge the status of a room based on its size, the status of the speakers, and the status of any people they follow. High status people are often the most followed so they guide the discovery. Without these people, discovery is gamed and less relevant.</p>



<p>Each room has status games being played within it as well. If you look at other live social apps, audiences generally do something like chat or react. On Clubhouse, anyone not talking has nothing to do except listen and look at other members of the room. When you look at the screen, you’ll see every room is a hierarchy. The important people on top, their support in the middle, and the audience on the bottom.</p>



<p>The important people are on stage. It is the highest form of being seen. In big rooms, if you are on stage, everyone’s attention is on you, even if you aren’t speaking. These people literally are at the top and take up the most space, having the largest avatars only three to a row. Their status increases by being there with high status people. This is the ultimate goal of a status-seeking Clubhouse user.</p>



<p>The next level of the hierarchy is the status support group. It is a designated zone for the group of people who the speakers follow. If high status people are here, it means the people on stage must be very high status. They provide extra credibility for those on stage and help the room get discovered by more people.</p>



<p>For example, a startup founder is speaking in a room and a prominent venture capitalist is in the audience. If that VC knows the company, there isn’t any new information going to be shared, but there is status to doing it. It is beneficial to the status of both the speaker (founder) and the status support member (VC) to be there. The venture capitalist’s authority rubs off on the speakers, making them seem more legitimate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The lowest in the hierarchy is the audience. These people are so far down the hierarchy they are rarely ever seen in large rooms. Anyone who wants to be seen and gain status should try to leave this area. People are here because they are truly interested in the conversation or are trying to move up the hierarchy so they can gain status. Low status audience members rarely get a chance to engage in big rooms. They are status fodder for people up the hierarchy.</p>



<h2><strong>Fighting to Be the Place to Be Seen</strong></h2>



<p>Now that the high status people are mostly gone, lower status people fill all levels and try to recreate the dynamics. The design of Clubhouse is still the same. People try to be seen on stage in popular rooms. Organizers try to optimize their room to be recommended. Users fill their bio with interests and topics they care about. All of this is diluted because the people with status aren’t there anymore. The status and recognition people want is not there.</p>



<p>There are fewer “must-listen” rooms with massive audiences. Rooms are smaller and driven by interests or topics, rather than the people involved. The recommendation algorithm, which is driven by people you follow, is less relevant. Following lists are increasingly filled with low status people who are active on Clubhouse rather than high status people from the real world. The exclusivity from launching as invite and iPhone only is wearing off now that anyone can join including Android users. Clubhouse is not the high status place to be seen anymore.</p>



<p>A way to illustrate this is the decline in fear of missing out on Clubhouse. Few people think they are missing anything by not being there. Compared to its peak when people were buying invites, sending them to their closest friends, spending hours on the platform, and talking about it on social media, Clubhouse doesn’t have the same magic it once did.</p>



<p>High status people can now be seen together in exclusive places in real life. In person parties and events are impossible to compete with. It also doesn’t help that Clubhouse is being copied by seemingly every other big tech company. Everyone wants to recreate the magic Clubhouse had.</p>



<p>Can Clubhouse ever recreate the magic of being a high status place to be seen? They can try. For every category of people, not only in tech and crypto, they must become “the place” to be seen with other high status people. High status people must want to flex their status and share it with others on the platform. If this happened, the low status cargo cult members would gain the status boost they’re looking for.</p>



<p>The other option is to embrace the lower status people. Many interesting rooms and behaviours are happening outside the big ones. Recent releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576771/clubhouse-dm-backchannel-update-message">messaging</a> give hints they are moving away from only being a “place to be seen.” The app has the potential to be the mass audio social network. This was likely the plan all along, and they had a lucky break with the “place to be seen” diversion.</p>



<p>Either way, people always want to be seen. Clubhouse, for a moment, captured that need. To succeed as once thought, they need to do it again at a larger scale or embrace the behaviours of lower status people. If not, the cargo cult of Clubhouse will continue.</p>

<p>tl; dr – I hypothesize the physical and emotional distance of ticketing systems reduces job satisfaction and propose solutions.</p>







<p>Bear with me.</p>



<p>I remember when I was a kid I knew how to code. I didn’t get as good grades as I could have, I didn’t shine in a few other ways, but despite this I knew I could do something special. I could build interesting things and I could fix problems.</p>



<p>When it came to my first job I felt the same way. At the time I’d say I was still a bit “rough around the edges” but I could fix problems, sometimes hard ones, and that made me useful. It felt great to be needed using the one way I knew I was good at. There was nothing like somebody walking over to my desk to tell me about a problem that was making their lives hard, and to be able to fix it for them.</p>



<p>Pretty soon though a number of more senior engineers started speaking up. “We can’t have interruptions like this. We need to be more structured. We need to track this work. We need to put to asks in JIRA.” I had the same reaction a lot of people do, which was “Why do we need to track this? Do we not trust everybody is working to the best of their ability?”. I got the usual answers about the importance of estimation, planning, etc, and didn’t entirely understand, but accepted.</p>



<p>Years later, senior myself, I would insist – <em>every code change must have an associated ticket</em>. That isn’t to say I’m some kind of agile evangelist, but I certainly found ticketing systems indispensable, even for the smallest of teams. Somewhere along the way I had forgotten that I had ever felt otherwise.</p>



<p>Next role I became the main SRE for a chaotic startup. Some people would hate it, but I <em>loved</em> it. The buzz and thrill and of a war-room was incomparable to the transactional feature development that would eventually lead to an A/B release that would then possibly lead to a small % improvement in a metric. I loved fixing things for other engineers who I saw in person, who were happy and impressed that I would fix their issue and improved the whole system to make the issue impossible in the future.</p>



<p>What I loved wasn’t inherent to being an SRE itself. Though a high-stakes role, it can also be as isolating as any role. It can be waking up to an alarm at night to login in by oneself and fix an issue, file a ticket, and have nobody notice.</p>



<p><strong>What I loved was face-to-face interaction and a shared emotional narrative. </strong></p>



<p><strong>From another angle </strong>– when I go to whole foods and watch the cashier scan my overpriced items, I wonder what they think. Though small talk with strangers is far from a strength for me, I struggle anyways to connect in whatever small way I can. I don’t think I could force a joke and trust the timing to line up with the variable checkout time. I try to be nice without being stiffly polite. It may mean bagging my own groceries, or avoiding the instinct to stare at my phone. I can’t even say for sure that cashiers notice or like it. <strong>I simply presume that if I were in their shoes I wouldn’t want to feel like a machine.</strong></p>



<h2>The Answer</h2>



<p>Well first, the question: How do we reconcile our desire to feel individually noticed and human with the business needs of standardization? I think this question is the most important piece of this article. I’ll make a proposal or two, to get the ball rolling, but the topic is wide-open.</p>



<ul><li>What if tickets are filed normally through jira, but then the filer must also come over to the desk of the person operating on the ticket and explain the issue face-to-face?</li><li>What if tickets are described in a way that stresses the emotional importance to the user of the feature?</li><li>What if end-user satisfaction and wishes, as captured by PMs who communicate with users, was shared with engineers?</li></ul>



<p>How would you achieve it?</p>

<h2>The price of .com at Gandi</h2>
<p>Therefore, we’ll be carrying over this price increase in our pricing grid. You can find the new prices for new domain creations, renewals, transfers, and restorations of <strong>.com</strong> domain names <strong>starting August 31, 2021 at 9:00 PM Pacific</strong> (September 1, 2021 at 4:00 UTC) in Grid A.</p>
<p><strong>.com </strong><a href="https://www.gandi.net/en-us/domain/tld/com">https://www.gandi.net/en-us/domain/tld/com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Create: <span><strong>$16.59* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$15.50<span>*</span></strong>)</li>
<li>Renewal: <span><strong>$16.59* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$15.50<span>*</span></strong>)</li>

<li>Restore: <span><strong>$139.10* </strong></span>(current price <strong>$130.00<span>*</span></strong>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>More price increases to come on .com?</h2>
<p>The domain name industry may see further price increases in <strong>.com</strong> domains in the coming years: besides this year’s price increase, Verisign has been permitted to increase .com prices up to 7% in 2022 and 2023 as well as between 2026 to 2029.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage you to renew your domain names for the maximum renewal period <strong>before August 31, 2021</strong> in order to benefit from the current price for the longest time frame.</p>
<p>If you’ve registered your domain name for 1 year, you can renew it for an additional 9 years.</p>

Mario Tama, via Getty.</figcaption></figure></div><p> <em>Edited by Sam Thielman </em></p><p><strong>DESPITE THE REDACTIONS</strong>, the pseudonyms, and the thousands of unreleased pages, the Senate intelligence committee’s report into post-9/11 CIA torture – that is, <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">the executive summary available to the public</a> – is the most robust oversight ever conducted of any part of the War on Terror. The committee typically defends the agencies and activities it nominally oversees; remarkably, the torture investigation revealed the gruesome realities inside the CIA’s black sites. It demonstrated, with precision and rigor, how the CIA constructed a Big Lie, called “Enhanced Interrogation,” around its barbarism. </p><p>But the committee’s lead investigator says that he could only investigate two of the three components of the torture program. The third is lost to history. </p><p><strong>THE CIA CALLED THE PROGRAM RDI</strong>, for <em>Renditions, Detentions and Interrogations</em>. “Renditions” are outsourced torture: the CIA abducts someone and sends them to be abused either by their home country’s security apparatus; or, in the “extraordinary rendition” variant, by a third country’s security apparatus. “Detentions” were the maintenance, logistics and direct operations of the black sites where the CIA, not an allied intelligence service, imprisoned people. “Interrogations” were the torture the CIA inflicted. </p><p>Renditions were the kernel of the program. They were the only aspect of CIA torture in operation on 9/11. The entity within the CIA Counterterrorism Center that conducted it, the Renditions Group, expanded after 9/11 to become the RDI Group, or “<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-113srpt288/pdf/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">RDG</a>.” One of the people involved in the Renditions Group from inception, Mike Scheuer, explained many years ago in an underappreciated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdb5nnRMrU">video</a>, “After 9/11, the CIA was the only game in town. The Bush White House pushed on the CIA to accelerate the rendition program.” (Scheuer has been on a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-scheuer-hunted-bin-laden-for-cia-now-he-wants-americans-dead">journey</a>.) </p><p>Yet we know vastly more about the <em>D</em> and the <em>I</em> than we know about the <em>R</em>. The Senate’s investigation solely concerned the CIA’s detentions and interrogations. Over the six years of the investigation, the CIA fought aggressively to restrict even that constrained mandate. It was not going to allow Senate investigators to <em>expand</em> their remit, according to Daniel J. Jones, the lead investigator. “<em>Everything</em> was a heavy lift,” Jones remembers.</p><p>And even if the agency somehow <em>had</em> allowed him to investigate renditions, Jones’ experience of digging through deliberately confusing and incomplete records that the CIA provided – and sometimes subsequently disappeared – leads him to the conclusion that the agency’s own renditions records are likely far from extensive. </p><p>“The [CIA’s detention and interrogation] records in 2002 are detailed. As the ‘DI’ program went on, we saw less and less robust record-keeping,” Jones recalls. “One could imagine that also applied to rendition.” </p><p>All three components of the program were tied together, and so occasionally Jones saw glimpses; suggestions and clues to what rendition was. But not only was rendition beyond the scope of his investigation, he already had to contend with the maddening and painstaking work of figuring out who was and was not in CIA custody, then figuring out how meaningful such distinctions were when it came both to internal classifications and the actual treatment of human beings. It was arduous.</p><p>Officially speaking, the Senate was able to tally <em>at least</em> 119 people whom the CIA held in the black sites during their 2002-2008 existence. “There’s a back-and-forth we had with the agency on who was a CIA detainee and who wasn’t. The committee, to arrive at 119, is extremely conservative. Everyone who was involved in this investigation believes there was more than 119 CIA detainees,” Jones explained. </p><p>“If the CIA doesn’t know how many people were in its own custody, it’s very unlikely there’s any record-keeping of people who were merely <em>transients</em>” – that is, briefly in CIA custody before being whisked to a partner intelligence service – “and those who <em>weren’t </em>in their custody. ...Tenet and every other [CIA] director said [the torture program] was the CIA’s central counterterrorism program at the time. Because it was a central program – and incredibly sensitive – it would be reasonable to think the CIA would maintain a robust classified record,” he continued. </p><p>“If, in fact, the ‘DI’ part was viewed as the central component of the War on Terror by the CIA, there’s no reason to believe they would hold better records with the rendition program.”</p><p><strong>TWO BROAD FACTS ABOUT CIA TORTURE</strong> make Jones’s supposition especially compelling.</p><p>First, the only reason the Senate intelligence committee investigated at all is that two leading figures inside the program, Jose Rodriguez and Gina Haspel, destroyed videotapes of the torture of two men inside the first post-9/11 black site – something that also sparked a <em>criminal</em> investigation. Once the Senate learned about the destruction of those tapes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html">from </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html">The New York Times</a></em>, rather than from the CIA, the committee could no longer credibly refuse to open an investigation of its own. </p><p>Second, in most major speeches and testimony, CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss, and Michael Hayden repeatedly emphasized that their War on Terror is an international team sport. They did this so often that journalists rarely bothered quoting it; it seemed like boilerplate. It was often self-serving, as when they cited the importance of cooperation with allied intelligence services as a reason to never disclose what that cooperation <em>did</em>. But they’re correct that reliance on various <em>Mukhabarats</em> makes their war viable. “I cannot overstate how vital these relationships are to our overall effort,” Hayden <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-michael-v-hayden-0">said</a> in one <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?200866-1/combatting-terrorism">typical September 2007</a> appearance.</p><p>The absence of renditions records, even to the Senate torture report, is no longer exactly <em>news</em>. I reported it in 2016 in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/cia-insider-daniel-jones-senate-torture-investigation">20,000-plus-word, three-part series for </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/cia-insider-daniel-jones-senate-torture-investigation">The Guardian</a></em>. But what has bothered me ever since is how little attention and care that absence has ever received. In the wake of our <a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">recent </a><em><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">Forever Wars </a></em><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/say-their-names-05a">piece about naming the dead</a>, I’ve been thinking about that more and more – the enormous gap in our historical knowledge of renditions; the likelihood that if the Senate torture report couldn’t go there, then we’re probably <em>not going</em> to fill those gaps; and the fact that pretty much no one gives a shit. </p><p>The awful conclusion is that disappearances work. </p><p><strong>WE KNOW </strong><em><strong>SOME </strong></em><strong>THINGS ABOUT RENDITIONS.</strong> In particular, we know that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees">the CIA took bondage nudes</a> of bound prisoners at the point of transferring them. <em>That</em> was documentation of the renditions – presumably made to provide proof that someone who might ultimately die in a foreign torture chamber was alive when the CIA had them. </p><p>Human Rights Watch, in 2008, was able to document 14 people the CIA rendered to the Jordanians. One of them, Abu Hamza al-Tabuki, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/04/07/double-jeopardy/cia-renditions-jordan#">recalled</a>: “from the first day, they began to interrogate me using the methods of terror and fear, torture and beating, insults and verbal abuse, and threatening to expose my private parts <em>and rape me</em>. I was repeatedly beaten, and insulted, along with my parents and family.” Those familiar with the history of torture, particularly in a context of war, will note how present <em>sexual </em>torture is within it. </p><p>When the U.S. helped overthrow Moammar Qaddafi in 2011, it inadvertently led to the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/triploidocs_appendix1.pdf">publication</a> of the files locked in the offices of Qaddafi’s internal-security apparatus. That ended up accidentally exposing what CIA-Libya cooperation looked like in practice. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/helping-gadhafi-torture/">It’s really not a pleasant read</a>. Neither is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/egyptian-cleric-defends-cia-agent-convicted-rendition-abu-omar">messy history</a> of the rendition of Abu Omar, whom the CIA abducted in Milan <em>after</em> Italy had granted him asylum. </p><p>In my 2016 <em>Guardian</em> piece, I reported that renditions were the “largest” part of RDI. Jones reminds me, helpfully, that “we don’t really actually know that.” </p><p>Fair enough. I was using a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-6-2007-0032_EN.html?redirect">European Parliament investigation from 2007</a> that reported: “at least <em>1,245 flights</em> operated by the CIA flew into European airspace or stopped over at European airports between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005, to which should be added an unspecified number of military flights for the same purpose; ...on one hand, there may have been more CIA flights than those confirmed by the investigations carried out by the Temporary Committee, while, on the other, not all those flights have been used for extraordinary rendition.” </p><p>Note that last line. Note how the EU acknowledges the limits of its investigative visibility into European complicity. The EU investigators are able to document over 1,200 CIA flights to Europe over four years. They can’t say each flight was a renditions ferry, or that each flight equals a person rendered. They <em>can</em> say they are unable to answer the question, and as a fallback, offer their best evidence as a proxy for the scale of a program whose surface they can barely scratch, thanks to the obstinacy of several governments. </p><p>Hayden, in 2007, weaponized that uncertainty to discredit the EU. “The suggestion that even a substantial number of those 1,245 flights were carrying detainees is frankly absurd on its face,” he <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-michael-v-hayden-0">scoffed</a>.</p><p>Except it’s not absurd at all. It is true that Hayden had exclusive access to whatever remained of the CIA record, so he could make assertions about the CIA torture program being “designed only for the most dangerous terrorists and those believed to have the most valuable information, such as knowledge of planned attacks” from a position of authority.</p><p>Unfortunately for Hayden, Scheuer, who said he “ran renditions” when he was at the Counterterrorism Center, accidentally contradicted him in 2008. </p><p>“Under Mr. Clinton we had focused on very senior al-Qaeda people,” Scheuer (who didn’t respond to a message seeking comment) recalled at an event at Berkeley that year. After 9/11, he told the audience, “the bar went down a little bit, and we began to pick other people up.” (This is around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxdb5nnRMrU">minute 32:30 in this video</a>.) </p><p>Defenders of rendition, Hayden included, tend to describe rendition as lawful, complete with guarantees from other nations of humane treatment. Scheuer is a rare CIA official who acknowledges on record that that’s bullshit. “Under Mr. Clinton, we were to take them off the street and arrange for them to be returned to a government that wanted them for a judicial process,” he said at that event. </p><blockquote><p>We went back to the White House and said, “This was what we planned to do, do you want us to do it?” Yes, was the answer. “Well, we’re going to take them to countries where they’re wanted, but your State Department, every year, is going to say ‘that country is a human rights abuser,’ or its judicial processes are not what we want them to be.” And everybody kind of puckered up and said, “Ooh, that may be a problem. Can you get these countries to say ‘We will treat these rendered people according to our own laws?’” And we said, “Yeah, we’re pretty sure that country X will treat them according [to their own laws] – that won’t get you off the hook!” But that’s as far as it went. Now, President Clinton and [national security adviser Sandy] Berger said that they insisted on guarantees that these prisoners would be treated according to American standards or international law. Now, I was there. I ran the operations. That was never a requirement that I knew of. That&#39;s entirely a kind of after-the-fact defense of what was done.</p></blockquote><p>Hayden has a track record of lying. When Jones was able to examine the records of the CIA’s detentions and interrogations, he saw just how heavily Hayden and others in the CIA manipulated the truth. An entire annex of the Senate intelligence report debunks a fusillade of lies Hayden told about CIA torture <em>in just one day of testimony.</em> (Appendix 3, starting on <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">page 462 of the report.</a>) And that’s not the end of it: see <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/">Reign of Terror</a></em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622555/reign-of-terror-by-spencer-ackerman/">, out on Tuesday</a>. (Also, I have a story about Hayden showing up at one of my band’s shows; I might write about that for subscribers, so please do subscribe.) </p><p>Scroll up in this piece to the quote from Jones about how there’s a “back-and-forth” over who the agency counts as detainees, prompting the Senate to act conservatively in tallying 119 men at the black sites. Hayden, in 2007, claimed the number of black-site prisoners was “fewer than 100.” All this is particularly glaring when reviewing Hayden’s assertion, in the same speech, that “the number of renditions is actually even a smaller number, mid-range two figures.” </p><p><strong>WHAT WE LACK</strong>, and what we will likely always lack, is a <em>systemic</em> understanding of the renditions, extraordinary and (<em>sighs</em>) “ordinary.” The Senate intelligence committee report emerged from a unique opportunity and set of historical circumstances. Neither will come again. Jones performed an extraordinary service for history. I don’t write any of this to fault <em>him</em> for being unable to unearth the rendition program – no one outside of the Church and Pike committees has done more to force <em>real</em> transparency out of the CIA. </p><p>“We had two options in a world of limited resources: to attempt to totally detail all the renditions; or to detail the ‘D and I’ in US custody,” Jones said. “It’s still the right call, but it makes the false assumption that Congress can only have the most minimal of investigative resources. In essence, we’ve decided to live in this world of limited oversight.” Damn. Sit with that quote a moment. </p><p>Jones is pointing to a consequence-free obliteration of truth. The mark on the victim’s body is torture’s true measurement, especially when we believe that every human being has inherent worth and dignity. The official denial that the mark was made, aggregated across an unknown number of people, is no longer a crime against them alone but a crime against history. One of the people directly involved in both the mark and the denial, <em>after both were known</em>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/she-should-be-in-jailrights-groups-rally-to-stop-torture-overseer-turned-trump-cia-pick-gina-haspel">rose to become CIA director</a>, to bipartisan acclaim. One of her <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-proxy-war-over-joe-biden-adviser-avril-haines">boosters</a> is, right now, the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/leadership/director-of-national-intelligence">Director of National Intelligence</a>. Another chairs the Senate intelligence committee. </p><p>“The oversight mechanisms and the executive branch have allowed both inappropriate and illegal behavior to happen without consequence,” said Jones. “There’s <em>never</em> any accountability. There is no leash. It’s just unclipped. In such a lax oversight environment, why would they think they need records?”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Emacs Lock-In Effect or the Emacs Sunk Cost Fallacy</title>

Update 2021-07-24: Reply/comment by Deep-Fox6860

</p>

<p>

This is an extended comment from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/opx6mb/sunk_cost_fallacy/">this original reddit thread</a> where <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Deep-Fox6860/">Deep-Fox6860</a> wrote:

</p>

<blockquote>Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had.</blockquote>

<p>

I think I understand what you&#39;re writing here and to some extend, I do agree.

</p>

<p>

However, <b>I would like to challenge the point of view</b> to this good philosophical question on tool choice with this article.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Property of Flexible Tools in General</h2></header>

<p>

Yes, Emacs is a platform that requires investment in time and knowledge to be mastered. But what you get is a system that is as flexible as possible to deal with present and future changes of requirements.

</p>

<p>

I can not think of a different situation where you are using a flexible tool that you adapt to your situation which does <b>not</b> come with the sunk cost fallacy or some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in effect</a>, how I call it in my <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/pim">PIM</a> lectures.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Openess and the Right Tool Choice Process</h2></header>

<p>

Another aspect is: everything within Emacs and org mode as a frequent use-case is open. So you&#39;re free to switch to a different tool. The positive side is that your problem is not &#34;getting all of your data out of Emacs&#34;. Your problem will be to find a more suitable tool which lets you import all this accumulated data or which is able to drive your processes and workflows.

</p>

<p>

In other words: In <b>any</b> situation where somebody finds a tool which fits to her/his set of requirements, working with it for a long time, adapting to the requirements step by step, generating data, managing information and knowledge, you will get to a point where switching to a different tool will cause you a high level of effort. This is nothing specific to Emacs in particular. In most cases, you will learn that you can&#39;t even get out all of your data any more. And here is where the openness of Emacs shines.

</p>

<p>

I&#39;ve written down my proposal on <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/2021/01/18/tool-choices">how people should choose their (software) tools</a>. If you followed this principle and your tool suits you well, you don&#39;t have to change to a different tool. (And if you do need to switch, following my tool choice process made sure that you are <b>able</b> to switch without data loss.)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Important Long-Term Aspects</h2></header>

<p>

<b>My personal opinion on Emacs is that I&#39;ll probably never switch to anything different in my life any more.</b> I learned to embrace its flexibility so that I can not think of many situations where Emacs does not provide me the features I need for my <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/pim">personal information management</a>. From this perspective, I do have a perfect lock-in situation which I usually try to avoid as much as possible. <b>This is the single lock-in situation I can think of that is a perfectly good thing to be in.</b>

</p>

<p>

Another aspect why I do not consider time investment in technology like Emacs is a bad thing: Emacs knowledge is <b>long-term knowledge</b>.

</p>

<p>

I did learn many things for proprietary tools over the last decades. A large percentage of this effort is now useless, making this past learning effort to a temporary one. Some knowledge got obsolete as fast as the next major release was published.

</p>

<p>

On the other hand side, whatever I&#39;ve learned for technologies like Emacs, LaTeX, GNU/Linux, and so forth in the nineties, is still valid and useful to me nowadays. This can not be stressed enough: instead of un-learning and re-learning, I was able to improve and learn new things. <b>This scales much better than any proprietary or temporary knowledge.</b>

</p>

	  <header><h2>Scheuklappen-Effekt (German for &#34;blinkers effect&#34;)</h2></header>

<p>

In German &#34;Scheuklappen-Effekt&#34; means that you have a narrowed view for some reason. I don&#39;t know if there is a similar phrase in the English language.

</p>

<p>

The difference between &#34;using Emacs for a long time and thinking less of other tools&#34; to the mentioned sunk cost fallacy situation may be that I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m using Emacs just because I don&#39;t think of alternatives any more. I use it because all in all, it&#39;s the best package I can get for now and most probably also for the future.

</p>

<p>

I&#39;m using many tools outside of Emacs which could be replaced by Emacs-modes/methods right away (<a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/tags/emails">email</a>, web browsing, most of file management, ...). However, the openness of Emacs (and Org mode) allows me to work with Emacs and other tools in parallel, interfacing them smoothly so that I don&#39;t have much pain with these &#34;borders&#34;.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Reply by Deep-Fox6860</h2></header>

<p>

With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/opx6mb/sunk_cost_fallacy/h69esq0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this comment on reddit</a>, Deep-Fox6860 added interesting aspects:

</p>

<blockquote>Regarding the openness, I started with org because I was hooked on the
idea of having everything as simple text files and I thought I would
be able to leave in the future, if I want to. I mean, the exits are
well marked and still people choose to stay, it seems.</blockquote>

<p>

Here is my answer to that:

</p>

<p>

Your remark on the openness and ability to move away is really interesting. It seems to be the case that people might tend to stay with tools that makes them more easy to leave. If this assumption is true, it has a certain level of irony, hasn&#39;t it?

</p>

<p>

Flexibility as a bad thing? Of course! In my PIM lecture, I do have a section where I explain that there are (very simplified!) two categories of tools: simple tools and advanced tools. Both categories are perfectly valid for matching requirements. The issue is that people use simple tools when an advanced tool would provide them much more advantages in the long run. Likewise - and this is what you are referring to - when you choose an advanced tool like Emacs can be for requirements where a simple tool would be the better fit, you do have to face issues. The point is that <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/2021/01/18/tool-choices">we need to teach people to do deliberate and wise choices for tools</a> before they do face issues because of wrong tool choice or lock-in effects.

<p>In reading Yan Zhu’s excellent write-up of the <a href="https://blog.azuki.vip/csrf/">JSON CSRF vulnerability</a> she found in OkCupid one thing puzzled me: I was under the impression that browsers these days default to treating cookies as <code>SameSite=Lax</code>, so I would expect attacks like the one Yan described not to work in modern browsers.</p>
<p>This lead me down a rabbit hole of exploring how SameSite actually works, including building <a href="https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/">an interactive SameSite cookie exploration tool</a> along the way. Here’s what I learned.</p>
<h4>Background: Cross-Site Request Forgery</h4>
<p>I’ve been tracking CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/csrf/?page=2">on this blog</a> since 2005(!)</p>
<p>A quick review: let’s say you have a page in your application that allows a user to delete their account, at <code>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</code>. The user has to be signed in with a cookie in order to activate that feature.</p>
<p>If you created that page to respond to <code>GET</code> requests, I as an evil person could create a page at <code>https://www.evil.com/force-you-to-delete-your-account</code> that does this:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>img</span> <span>src</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>If I can get you to visit my page, I can force you to delete your account!</p>
<p>But you’re smarter than that, and you know that GET requests should be idempotent. You implement your endpoint to require a POST request instead.</p>
<p>Turns out I can still force-delete accounts, if I can trick a user into visiting a page with the following evil HTML on it:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span> <span>action</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/delete-my-account</span>&#34; <span>method</span>=&#34;<span>POST</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>submit</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>Delete my account</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>forms</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>The form submits with JavaScript the instant they load the page!</p>
<p>CSRF is an extremely common and nasty vulnerability—especially since it’s a hole by default: if you don’t know what CSRF is, you likely have it in your application.</p>
<p>Traditionally the solution has been to use CSRF tokens—hidden form fields which “prove” that the user came from a form on your own site, and not a form hosted somewhere else. OWASP call this the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie">Double Submit Cookie</a> pattern.</p>
<p>Web frameworks like Django implement <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/">CSRF protection</a> for you. I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asgi-csrf">asgi-csrf</a> to help add CSRF token protection to ASGI applications.</p>
<h4>Enter the SameSite cookie attribute</h4>
<p>Clearly it would be better if we didn’t have to worry about CSRF at all.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, work on specifying the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute started <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/commit/aa0722c12ccb367b8f4498e982616064d105a006#diff-70cc0c0600a934d002ea91a4a36d5eb0b7d5edebcce5a40c9a811391cc0fecf6">in June 2016</a>. The idea was to add an additional attribute to cookies that specifies the policy for if they should be included in requests made to a domain from pages hosted on another domain.</p>
<p>Today, all modern browsers support SameSite. MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite">has SameSite documentation</a>, but a summary is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SameSite=None</code>—the cookie is sent in “all contexts”—more-or-less how things used to work before SameSite was invented.</li>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Strict</code>—the cookie is only sent for requests that originate on the same domain. Even arriving on the site from an off-site link will not see the cookie, unless you subsequently refresh the page or navigate within the site.</li>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Lax</code>—cookie is sent if you navigate to the site through following a link from another domain but <em>not</em> if you submit a form. This is generally what you want to protect against CSRF attacks!</li>
</ul>
<p>The attribute is specified by the server in a <code>set-cookie</code> header that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>set-cookie: lax-demo=3473; Path=/; SameSite=lax
</code></pre>
<p>Why not habitually use <code>SameSite=Strict</code>? Because then if someone follows a link to your site their first request will be treated as if they are not signed in at all. That’s bad!</p>
<p>So explicitly setting a cookie with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> should be enough to protect your application from CSRF vulnerabilities... provided your users have a browser that supports it.</p>
<p>(Can I Use reports <a href="https://caniuse.com/same-site-cookie-attribute">93.95% global support</a> for the attribute—not quite high enough for me to stop habitually using CSRF tokens, but we’re getting there.)</p>
<h4>What if the SameSite attribute is missing?</h4>
<p>Here’s where things get interesting. If a cookie is set without a SameSite attribute at all, how should the browser treat it?</p>
<p>Over the past year, all of the major browsers have been changing their default behaviour. The goal is for a missing SameSite attribute to be treated as if it was <code>SameSite=Lax</code>—providing CSRF protection by default.</p>
<p>I have found it infuriatingly difficult to track down if and when this change has been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome/Chromium offer <a href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site">the best documentation</a>—they claim to have ramped up the new default to 100% of users in August 2020. WebViews in Android still have the old default behaviour, which is scheduled to be fixed in Android 12 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_12">not yet released</a>).</li>
<li>Firefox have a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/">blog entry from August 2020</a> which says “Starting with Firefox 79 (June 2020), we rolled it out to 50% of the Firefox Beta user base”—but I’ve not been able to find any subsequent updates.</li>
<li>I have no idea at all what’s going on with Safari!</li>
</ul>
<p>I started <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1422366158171238400">a Twitter thread</a> to try and collect more information, so please reply there if you know what’s going on in more detail.</p>
<h4>The Chrome 2-minute twist</h4>
<p>Assuming all of the above, the mystery remained: how did Yan’s exploit fail to be prevented by browsers?</p>
<p>After some back-and-forth about this on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1422370774896177154">Yan proposed</a> that the answer may be this detail, tucked away on the <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592">Chrome Platform Status page for Feature: Cookies default to SameSite=Lax</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Chrome will make an exception for cookies set without a SameSite attribute less than 2 minutes ago. Such cookies will also be sent with non-idempotent (e.g. POST) top-level cross-site requests despite normal SameSite=Lax cookies requiring top-level cross-site requests to have a safe (e.g. GET) HTTP method. Support for this intervention (“Lax + POST”) will be removed in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like OkCupid were setting their authentication cookie without a <code>SameSite</code> attribute... which opened them up to a form-based CSRF attack but only for the 120 seconds following the cookie being set!</p>
<h4>Building a tool to explore SameSite browser behaviour</h4>
<p>I was finding this all very confusing, so I built a tool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The code lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/samesite-lax-demo">simonw/samesite-lax-demo</a> on GitHub, but the tool itself has two sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A server-side Python (<a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>) web application for setting cookies with different <code>SameSite</code> attributes. This is hosted on Vercel at <a href="https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/">https://samesite-lax-demo.vercel.app/</a>
</li>
<li>An HTML page on a different domain that links to that cookied site, provides a POST form targetting it, embeds an image from it and executes some <code>fetch()</code> requests against it. This is at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/samesite-lax-demo/">https://simonw.github.io/samesite-lax-demo/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hosting on two separate domains is critical for the tool to show what is going on. I chose Vercel and GitHub Pages because they are both trivial to set up to continuously deploy changes from a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Using the tool in different browsers helps show exactly what is going on with regards to cross-domain cookies.</p>
<p>A few of the things I observed using the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as you would expect. It’s particularly interesting to follow the regular <code>&lt;a href=...&gt;</code> link from the static site to the application and see how the strict cookie is NOT visible upon arrival—but becomes visible when you refresh that page.</li>
<li>I included a dynamically generated SVG in a <code>&lt;img src=&#34;/cookies.svg&#34;&gt;</code> image tag, which shows the cookies (using SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>) that are visible to the request. That image shows all four types of cookie when embedded on the Vercel domain, but when embedded on the GitHub pages domain it differs wildly:
<ul>
<li>Firefox 89 shows both the <code>SameSite=None</code> and the missing SameSite cookies</li>
<li>Chrome 92 shows just the <code>SameSite=None</code> cookie</li>
<li>Safari 14.0 shows no cookies at all!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chrome won’t let you set a <code>SameSite=None</code> cookie without including the <code>Secure</code> attribute.</li>
<li>I also added some JavaScript that makes a cross-domain <code>fetch(..., {credentials: &#34;include&#34;})</code> call against a <code>/cookies.json</code> endpoint. This didn’t send any cookies at all until I added server-side headers <code>access-control-allow-origin: https://simonw.github.io</code> and <code>access-control-allow-credentials: true</code>. Having done that, I got the same results across the three browsers as for the <code>&lt;img</code> test described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Safari ignoring <code>SameSite=None</code> turns out to be this bug: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198181">Cookies with SameSite=None or SameSite=invalid treated as Strict</a>—it’s marked as fixed but I’m not certain the fix has been released yet—it doesn’t seem to be fixed on my macOS 10.15.6 laptop or my iOS 14.7.1 iPhone.</p>
<p>Most excitingly, I was able to replicate the Chrome two minute window bug using the tool! Each cookie has its value set to the timestamp when it was created, and I added code to display how many seconds ago the cookie was set. Here’s an animation showing how Chrome on a form submission navigation can see the cookie that was set with <code>SameSite</code> missing at 114 seconds old, but that cookie is no longer visible once it passes 120 seconds.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Consider your subdomains</h4>
<p>One last note about CSRF that you should consider:  <code>SameSite=Lax</code> still allows form submissions from  subdomains of your primary domain to carry their cookies.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a XSS vulnerability on one of your subdomains the security of your primary domain will be compromised.</p>
<p>Since it’s common for subdomains to host other applications that may have their own security concerns, ditching CSRF tokens for Lax cookies may not be a wise step!</p>
<h4 id="login-csrf-samesite-lax">Login CSRF and SameSite=Lax</h4>
<p>Login CSRF is an interesting variety of CSRF with slightly different rules.</p>
<p>A Login CSRF attack is when a malicious forces a user to sign into an account controlled by the attacker. Why do this? Because if that user then saves sensitive information the attacker can see it.</p>
<p>Imagine I trick you into signing into an e-commerce account I control and saving your credit card details. I could then later sign in myself and buy things on your card!</p>
<p>Here’s how that would work: Say the site’s login form makes a POST to <code>https://www.example.com/login</code> with <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> as the form fields. If those credentials match, the site sets an authentication cookie.</p>
<p>I can set up my evil website with the following form:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span> <span>action</span>=&#34;<span>https://www.example.com/login</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>hidden</span>&#34; <span>name</span>=&#34;<span>username</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>my-username</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span>=&#34;<span>hidden</span>&#34; <span>name</span>=&#34;<span>password</span>&#34; <span>value</span>=&#34;<span>my-password</span>&#34;<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>forms</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>I trick you into visiting my evil pge and you’re now signed in to that site using an account that I control. I cross my fingers and hope you don’t notice the “you are signed in as X” message in the UI.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about Login CSRF is that, since it involves setting a cookie but not sending a cookie, <code>SameSite=Lax</code> would seem to make no difference at all. You need to look to other mechanisms to protect against this attack.</p>
<p>But actually, you can use <code>SameSite=Lax</code> to prevent these. The trick is to only allow logins from users that are carrying at least one cookie which you have set in that way—since you know that those cookies could not have been sent if the user originated in a form on another site.</p>
<p>Another option: check the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin">HTTP Origin header</a> on the oncoming request.</p>
<h4>Final recommendations</h4>
<p>As an application developer, you should set all cookies with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> unless you have a very good reason not to. Most web frameworks do this by default now—Django shipped <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/9a56b4b13ed92d2d5bb00d6bdb905a73bc5f2f0a">support for this</a> in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/2.1/#requests-and-responses">Django 2.1</a> in August 2018.</p>
<p>Do you still need CSRF tokens as well? I think so: I don’t like the idea of users who fire up an older browser (maybe borrowing an obsolete computer) being vulnerable to this attack, and I worry about the subdomain issue described above.</p>
<p>And if you work for a browser vendor, please make it easier to find information on what the default behaviour is and when it was shipped!</p>

			<p>Portfolio reviews have returned to their in person form again, at least to a limited extent, as places are slowly opening up after nearly eighteen months of restrictions. So I recently found myself returning to Cortona, where the cars are reassuringly as <a href="https://leejo.github.io/2017/08/01/cortonas_damaged_cars/" target="_blank">damaged</a> as they have ever been:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was four years since my last visit so amongst viewing the exhibitions I attended a few portfolio reviews to show a <a href="https://www.formulanon.com" target="_blank">new project</a>, which is actually an old project - one I started shooting in 2009. I had shown this project a couple of weeks earlier at some online portfolio reviews in Arles, and going back further I had shown the works in progress at events in 2014, 2016, and 2018.</p>

<p>The work has changed and grown, my eye has matured, my photos have gotten better, more formal, more considered, the work is now more cohesive. Regardless the response to the project has always been positive<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, no matter what stage it was at.</p>

<p>The work is now in a much more complete form, namely a maquette (dummy book), albeit a very early draft form. But you can flick through it to get a much better feel for the project. There is still far too much work, but the early approach in these drafts is to keep the edit loose and tighten it up.</p>

<p>Presenting the work in this form has given me the same positive responses - it’s an interesting project, well shot, with a good balance of the formal, detail, landscape, and some humour. There is enough work to do a really tight strong edit, and scope to do multiple parts, along with editorial pieces. There are many single images that could stand on their own. It shows us something in a way we haven’t really seen it before.</p>

<p>Nice. But here comes the kicker, the question I have been hearing more as I present the project as a dummy photobook: “[If you are aiming to produce a book then] who is your audience?”</p>

<p><strong><i>Who</i> is Your Audience?</strong></p>

<p>The question is somewhat rhetorical of course, and I always answer it in the same way: photobooks are largely bought by people that buy photobooks, they are rarely bought by those who are interested in the subject of the project. When I say this the response by the reviewer is always a smile.</p>

<p>Because they know this to be true, whether they be a photobook publisher, editor, gallery owner, festival organiser, or whatever. The art world is small, the art photobook world is even smaller, and the numbers of art photobooks that sell is smaller still.</p>

<p>People don’t buy art. I’m generalising here of course, where “people” represents the public at large. I say this having been involved in a gallery and exhibition space since early 2018, one that probably sells <em>more</em> volume (in terms of unit, not necessarily price) than most - a gallery in an alpine ski resort. Sure we get lots of visitors, lots of positive comments, but the ratio of visitors to sales is probably, what, 25:1? And that’s people that get into the gallery, the ratio of passers-by to visitors is much larger.</p>

<p>And people really don’t buy photobooks either. Where do you even find photobooks? Bookshops, maybe, but only the larger ones will stock photobooks and even then only the top sellers. Photobook shops, sure they exist but not really outside of the big/arty cities? Galleries, yes but most people don’t visit those. Direct from artist and publisher websites? Yep, sure. Amazon.com? Or course, but who is going to drop $40+ on an unseen photobook?</p>

<p>We can probably break down the potential buyers, the audience for photobooks, into five groups being those who…</p>

<ol>
  <li>… are interested in photobooks (regardless of the subject)</li>
  <li>… are interested in the artist/subject/project (and maybe buy photobooks/prints)</li>
  <li>… are interested in the concept (“the book as an object” type of thing)</li>
  <li>… buy photobooks as gifts for others (some crossover with 1)</li>
  <li>… buy photobooks as an investment (flippers/resellers).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of my purchasing is a combination of 1 and 2 - I am interested in photobooks but am informed significantly by the subject/project. There are many photobooks that find themselves as best sellers, or award winning, or praised by many, that I have no interest in.</p>

<p>The ideal project for a publisher is something that combines the first four groups. Get that right and you could be looking at sales figures two orders of magnitude larger than the norm. What’s the norm? Well most photobooks by established fine art photobook publishers sell in the region of hundreds of copies. If you self publish you might sell dozens. If the photographer is well established, or the publisher has a much bigger marketing effort and/or reach then a few thousand copies might be sold. Maybe, just maybe, sales might break tens of thousands if everything comes together. This is rare.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised by the low numbers. As I said - photobooks are mostly bought be people that buy photobooks! And quality photobooks are expensive, which largely alienates those in groups 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>To expand on this - I recently spoke with a publisher about my project and they liked it but expressed it wasn’t commercial and might sell a 1,000 copies at a push. Which is entirely fair. They then gave an example of one of their recent releases, a book of dog photography<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and said that it had <em>only</em> sold about 4,000 copies despite a massive marketing push and a joint effort with a larger publisher.</p>

<p>But photos of dogs? The audience for this book from the above list is 2 and 4, and I would say the “gifts for others” group is significantly reduced as the book is priced at £35. So we’re left with “those who are interested in the artist/subject/project” - but all the dog owners I know would have absolutely no interest in a photobook of dogs. If they want to see photos of dogs they’ll just search for #dog using Instagram, and scroll until the heat death of the universe, they’re not going to buy a book.</p>

<p>That’s definitely some [dog] food for thought: the number of dog owners is massive, a quick search suggests one in four people have a dog. But the number of those who would buy a photobook? If we assume best (or worst?) case here that everyone of those had become aware of the book that means approx 0.000001%<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> given the sales figure of 4,000 copies.</p>

<p><strong>Who is <i>Your</i> Audience?</strong></p>

<p>If you ever watch photography videos on YouTube you’ve probably stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/froknowsphoto/videos" target="_blank">Jared Polin</a>. Jared’s channel is an example of many of those you can find on YouTube, in that it’s more about technology than photography.</p>

<p>They’re the modern equivalent to the magazines that used to be popular in the 80s/90s/00s - full of articles on how to use your camera, reviews of new gear, post processing tips, all that kind of stuff. It’s useful, and potentially interesting stuff, and really quite popular, but it’s not really what I would class as “photographic” content.</p>

<p>Jared isn’t alone here - there are literally thousands of these channels on YouTube that have the same type of content. Some channels even started out more photographic but pivoted heavily towards the technology type of content as they realised that’s what most people want. “The Art of Photography” for example is one of those channels that pivoted a few years ago to this content<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because it sells, in terms of views. Massively so in some cases. And that’s because most people who are interested in photography are interested in content about the technology; they buy cameras and lenses and accessories and software, they don’t buy prints or photobooks or visit galleries and exhibitions.</p>

<p>Most photographers aren’t really interested in art either, so they don’t buy it. I mean, how many photographers do you know that have shelves full of photobooks?</p>

<p>Order “The Art of Photography” videos by most popular and you have to scroll a long way beyond the clickbait gear reviews before you get to the (excellent) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGEE7pGLuppS6Wn-FHetQPfo0QbeDiTYe" target="_blank">“The Artist Series”</a> - content that receives one fifth of the views of the technology focussed videos.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Your <i>Audience</i>?</strong></p>

<p>So what happened when Jared decided to create a photobook? That’s somewhat of a pivot in terms of content. Would his audience be the same as those who watch his videos, listen to his podcast, buy his tutorials and plugins? No, I think that’s evident from what I’ve already said. However, Jared’s channel has (as of writing) 1.3million subscribers.</p>

<p>Could he sell a couple of thousand copies to some of those 1.3million subscribers? A couple of thousand copies by any measure is large number for a photobook. For a self published book that figure is enormous.</p>

<p>I think it’s worth pointing out that this appears to be more a project about the making of a high quality photobook rather than the actual subject of the photobook itself. Jared has been drip feeding content on the making of the book for <a href="https://www.berniephotobook.com/info" target="_blank">several months</a>, which reveals some of the thought process, costs, design decisions, and goals.</p>

<p>I found out about this project via Hacker News<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and spent some time watching Jared’s videos and listening to the podcasts. So, immediately Jared captured at least one more viewer/listener (per video) via a comment on an entirely unrelated source - a lot of projects are discovered this way. Mission accomplished, right? Eh maybe. Let’s go over what went through my head when I watched/listened to the rationale and learned about the project. I jotted down notes here as bullet points, with my thoughts/responses in italics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jared wants to tell a story via photos
    <ul>
      <li>but is adamant on having QR codes from the offset (little to no text)</li>
      <li><em>so it’s telling a story via photos but largely by additional commentary?</em></li>
      <li>would rather listen to the story than read (<em>would he get this far in this blog post?</em>)</li>
      <li>perceives the book as a vehicle for the QR code/commentary/audio story
        <ul>
          <li><em>so from the offset this is not really a <strong>photo</strong>book</em> in the traditional sense?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Was initially aiming more at his YouTube core audience
    <ul>
      <li>wanted a book (or books) of all previous work/photo stores</li>
      <li>the Bernie book idea came later
        <ul>
          <li><em>perhaps the realisation that these videos wouldn’t appeal to the audience of technologists informed that?</em></li>
          <li><em>and that those who might buy the book are less interested in Jared’s work?</em></li>
          <li><em>so something more cohesive, or less about Jared would be a better first book?</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Estimates 1% of viewers (of this series of videos) will buy a book
    <ul>
      <li>25,000 views -&gt; 250 sales
        <ul>
          <li><em>seems like a realistic percentage</em></li>
        </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Very much focusing on the book as an object, in terms of size, quality, QR codes

      <li><em>it’s about the book (as an object), the documentary, the commentary, YouTube</em></li>
      <li>“it’s about the story” <em>of making the book, not the subject of the book</em></li>
      <li><em>this is not a book about Bernie, it’s a book about Jared who happened to be shooting photos of Bernie</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should reserve any opinion on the actual book until I have seen it, but at $120 (being a EU purchaser) it’s not something I am willing to spend that much on given what I have seen so far - there’s enough here to form an initial set of thoughts…</p>

<p>In general it’s cool to see more of this content on photography channels that are usually more focused on the gear. However, as a photobook this is probably pretty weak. It’s not a compelling project or photobook, nor would the time frame yield enough variety in images to create a strong edit. You need to follow your subject for a much longer time period (months, if not <em>years</em>) to get enough content to make a photobook<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The preview images we see are nothing new, nor are they strong enough to make most people want to see more. The three (?) shoots might yield enough photos to make a good six, twelve, or twenty image editorial piece, but a book? If you were going to create a book from this you might want to play with the form a little and perhaps be a bit more meta in the design.</p>

<p>Although the subject is divisive (just look at some of the comments on the videos), that’s not necessarily a bad thing if you can work around it. I have photobooks on political figures that I abhor<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, but the books or projects/approach are done brilliantly. The problem in Jared’s project is that there’s too many images, too many of them are (probably?) too similar, and we’ve seen it all before.</p>

<p>Even the “bangers” aren’t that interesting - we’ve seen <a href="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/650/299/d049cb0202cc44fe9aad02b3af6737ed_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1621968045&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=674ef84cb92580b21930811b98005068" target="_blank">these types of photos</a> thousands of times, either contextually within <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=political+rally&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">the type of photography we see from political rallies</a> or otherwise. So you’re never going to appeal to those who dislike the subject of the book but might be interested in photobooks.</p>

<p>Other problems are that it’s big and expensive even by photobook standards. $60 + $60 to ship outside the US means $120. Jared is losing a large part of his audience that exists outside the US who might have bought the book. The book doesn’t need to be as big as it is, half to two thirds the size (dimensions and number of photos) would have made a much cheaper book to buy and ship.</p>

<p>The QR codes for commentary approach is an interesting one but ultimately a mistake I feel. These will be non-functioning in twenty or even ten years time; the book will be left to stand alone on its photographic content, which <em>most</em> photobooks should anyway, so focus on making the strongest book of photos.</p>

<p>All that said, Jared’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jaredpolin/bernie" target="_blank">campaign</a> was successful<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, more than doubling its (financial) goal. It looks like the number of copies pre-sold will be close to the estimate of 500 and if the book is on Amazon as well it may well sell a few hundred more. It looks like Jared will be close to breaking even, perhaps a small profit.</p>

<p>However, the reality is that if an unknown photographer had created and self published this book they might have sold a dozen copies. Fifty copies if they were very lucky. It really is an editorial piece at most, not a book project. I suspect Jared will still have a few pallets of the book stuck in storage for a while if he has ordered 2,000 books.</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> an outlier. A photographer with an inbuilt audience large enough that the subset of “those who are interested in photobooks” and “those who are interested in the artist/subject/project” created the sales. I suspect the majority are of the latter not the former. Jared will have gained more subscribers and viewers due to the nature of the project (the “making of”) rather than the subject of the project, so I think he/we can say yes: mission accomplished.</p>

<p>So props to Jared for achieving that, all while creating content that is more interesting than the usual content on his channel and being transparent on the process and costs - I’m sure many viewers were shocked to realise how much producing a high quality photobook can cost. This type of content I would consider something a bit more “photographic”, let’s see more of this in future please?</p>

<p><strong>So, Who is <i>My</i> Audience?</strong></p>

<p>I think we’ve established that I don’t know, other than the aforementioned reply of “the photobook crowd”, which is pretty small. Clearly there’s crossover with the audience that follows the subject, an audience of five hundred million fans, but probably not so much. If I can capture one percent of one percent of one percent that’s an entire print run for most small independent photobook publishers. Maybe.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/" target="_blank">I’ve put a sample of the work out there</a>. Not just this project, but others I have been working on over the past decade as well. It’s a small sample - in the case of the Formula 1 work just thirty images out of over two thousand, of which I would say one/two hundred are strong enough to be part of a final edit.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> a small sample, but aimed to create interest. I’ve held this back for long enough, now I need to get it out there. I hope to find my audience, but I figure it’s more likely they will find me.</p>

      <title>In internal memo, Apple addresses concerns around new Photo scanning features</title>
      <link>https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-internal-memo-icloud-photo-scanning-concerns/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
						<p>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/05/apple-announces-new-protections-for-child-safety-imessage-safety-icloud-photo-scanning-more/">yesterday officially announced</a> a range of new features coming later this year, dubbed Expanded Protections for Children. The new features include protections for sensitive images in iMessage, iCloud Photo scanning for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) content, and new knowledge for Siri and Search. </p>
<p>In an internal memo distributed to the teams that worked on this project and obtained by <em>9to5Mac, </em>Apple acknowledges the “misunderstandings” around the new features, but doubles down on its belief that these features are part of an “important mission” for keeping children safe. </p>

<p>Apple has faced a significant amount of pushback for these features, including from notable sources such <a href="https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1423469854347169798?s=21">as Edward Snowden</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. The criticism centers primarily on Apple’s plans to scan iCloud Photos to check against a database of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) for matches and the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/comment-apples-child-protection-measures-get-mixed-reactions-from-experts/">potential implications of such a feature</a>. </p>
<p>The memo, which was distributed late last night and obtained by <em>9to5Mac</em>, was written by Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a software VP at Apple. Marineau-Mes says that Apple will continue to “explain and detail the features” included in this suite of Expanded Protections for Children. </p>
<p>Marineau-Mes writes that while Apple has seen “many positive responses” to these new features, it is aware that “some people have misunderstandings” about how the features will work, and “more than a few are worried about the implications.” Nonetheless, Marineau-Mes doubles down on Apple’s belief that these are necessary features to “protect children” while also maintaining Apple’s “deep commitment to user privacy.” </p>
<p>Here is the memo in full: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today marks the official public unveiling of Expanded Protections for Children, and I wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for all of your hard work over the last few years. We would not have reached this milestone without your tireless dedication and resiliency.</p>
<p>Keeping children safe is such an important mission. In true Apple fashion, pursuing this goal has required deep cross-functional commitment, spanning Engineering, GA, HI, Legal, Product Marketing and PR. What we announced today is the product of this incredible collaboration, one that delivers tools to protect children, but also maintain Apple’s deep commitment to user privacy. </p>
<p>We’ve seen many positive responses today. We know some people have misunderstandings, and more than a few are worried about the implications, but we will continue to explain and detail the features so people understand what we’ve built. And while a lot of hard work lays ahead to deliver the features in the next few months, I wanted to share this note that we received today from NCMEC. I found it incredibly motivating, and hope that you will as well.</p>
<p>I am proud to work at Apple with such an amazing team. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memo also includes a message from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, signed by Marita Rodriguez, executive director of strategic partnerships. Apple is working closely with NCMEC on the new iCloud scanning features. </p>
<p>Here is the full text of the note from NCMEC sent to the team at Apple working on these features: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team Apple,</p>
<p>I wanted to share a note of encouragement to say that everyone at NCMEC is SO PROUD of each of you and the incredible decisions you have made in the name of prioritizing child protection.</p>
<p>It’s been invigorating for our entire team to see (and play a small role in) what you unveiled today.</p>
<p>I know it’s been a long day and that many of you probably haven’t slept in 24 hours. We know that the days to come will be filled with the screeching voices of the minority.</p>
<p>Our voices will be louder.</p>
<p>Our commitment to lift up kids who have lived through the most unimaginable abuse and victimizations will be stronger.</p>
<p>During these long days and sleepless nights, I hope you take solace in knowing that because of you many thousands of sexually exploited victimized children will be rescued, and will get a chance at healing and the childhood they deserve.</p>
<p>Thank you for finding a path forward for child protection while preserving privacy.</p>

      <title>Learning APL</title>

  <div id="introduction">

<blockquote>
<p>A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
–<em>Alan Perlis</em></p></blockquote>
<div id="who-is-this-for">
<h2>Who is this for?<a href="#who-is-this-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I wrote this to be the book I would have wanted to read when I started to learn APL. An introduction to APL for an experienced practitioner from a different programming language or two. We all learn in different ways, and I prefer the fundamental concepts laid bare first, and then learn by example.</p>
<p>I came to APL after discovering a file of <a href="https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/ad.k">solutions</a> to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> 2015 challenge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)">K</a>, an APL derivative. That’s around 100 lines of actual code, and whilst I didn’t understand any of it, I kept looking at it, trying to figure out which of the 50 problems (well, 49) this was a solution to. Each of my Python solutions typically ran to 50-100 lines+ for the bulk of the problems.</p>
<p>Turns out it was the whole lot. That blew my mind.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-apl">
<h2>What is APL?<a href="#what-is-apl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>APL is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">array language</a>, and one of the oldest programming languages still in use today, next to <a href="https://fortran-lang.org/">FORTRAN</a>, <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">Lisp</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>. APL uses its own curious-looking symbols, like <code><span>⍎⌽⍕⌈*○≡⍬</span></code>, rather than reserved words written out in English like most other languages, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. As a language, APL sits at a very high level of abstraction, making it well suited to ultra-concise formulations of algorithms.</p>
<p>APL is a language that time is only now beginning to catch up with. Modern processors sport dedicated vector-oriented instructions and APL presents a high degree of mechanical sympathy ideally suited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD instructions</a> and by often being completely branchless in nature. APL, and its more punk rock little sister, K, really <em>fly</em>. APL can offer unprecedented programmer efficiency, as well as all-out execution speed.</p>
<p>But isn’t <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/is-apl-dead/">APL dead</a>? APL is alive and well.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-should-i-learn-apl">
<h2>Why should I learn APL?<a href="#why-should-i-learn-apl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will have your own motivations for wanting to learn APL. If you’re searching for the hottest thing on the market right now, to land a job at a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp">FAANG</a> or pad your resumé with the most marketable skills, there are many other programming languages that will offer a better return: <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>… APL doesn’t make a show in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a> in the top 100 “most popular” programming languages. Apparently, COBOL, <a href="https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_programming.html">Logo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> are all more “popular” than APL, at the time of writing. That’s not to say there aren’t extremely well-paid jobs around for engineers with skills in the “Iverson-family” languages (<a href="https://www.dyalog.com">APL</a>, <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/#/">J</a>, <a href="https://shakti.sh/">K</a>, <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/learn/startingkdb/language/">Q</a> etc), especially in finance. There are.</p>
<p>However, learning APL will reward you in other ways. Perhaps the old trope about “expanding your mind” is tired, but if your background is “C-like” – C, <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>, Java, Python etc – you will be exposed to a new way of solving problems. In fact, learning new programming languages that come from a different paradigm is a force multiplier for your brain.</p>
<p>Talking about Lisp, but equally applicable to APL, <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a> says in his essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to become a hacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisp is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the topic of Lisp, one of my <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">favorite xkcd strips</a> talks about Lisp’s parentheses as ‘elegant weapons for a more civilized age’, paraphrasing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb8AYnRb-4">Star Wars</a>. It could also have been said about APL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>APL was conceived as a <em>notation for thought</em>. It actually took years before it even had an actual implementation as a programming language. APL is a very natural way to express algorithms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson">Ken Iverson</a>, the creator of APL, was awarded the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/iverson_9147499.cfm">ACM Turing Award</a> in 1979 for his work on APL, and his accompanying paper, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358896.358899">Notation as a Tool of Thought</a> is somewhat of a computer science milestone. <a href="https://www.dyalog.com">Dyalog</a>, a leading commercial APL solutions provider, make a reference to this in their corporate tag-line: “The Tool of Thought for Software Solutions”.</p>
<p>If you persist, you may discover an added bonus: code you write in <em>other</em> languages suddenly becomes more concise and efficient, too.</p>

<div id="but-it-s-unreadable">
<h2>…but it’s unreadable!<a href="#but-it-s-unreadable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every time APL gets a mention on <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=apl&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=story">Hacker News</a> (it happens regularly), someone chirps up in the comments that “APL is unreadable”, so let’s deal with that upfront.</p>

</div>
<p>There it is – perfectly readable: squiggle, squiggle, greek letter, weird symbol….</p>
<p>The key is that readability is in the eye of the beholder. To an APL programmer, the above implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a> is perfectly readable. Claiming that something is unreadable because <em>you</em> can’t read it is intellectually dishonest. I don’t speak, or indeed read, Japanese, but that doesn’t make Japanese in any way unreadable. As master haiku smith, Bashō (松尾 金作), exclaimed:</p>

<p>The summer grasses. // All that remains // Of warriors’ dreams.</p>
<p>What is a fairer observation is that APL <em>doesn’t look anything like</em> the other programming languages you know, and yes, learning APL sure presents a different kind of challenge. If you’re a seasoned (say) Python programmer, and you decide to pick up <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, you can reasonably expect to follow code written by others from day 1, and learn enough syntax within a day or two to write code yourself. Sure, it takes a bit longer to find your way around the standard library and learn how to write idiomatic Ruby, but still. If you’ve learned a few languages like that, picking up another represents known and quantifiable effort.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: there <em>will</em> be more initial friction when learning APL – for starters, your keyboard doesn’t even have the squiggly symbols! Having said that, APL is a <em>tiny</em> language – there is negligible amounts of syntax to pick up, and believe it or not, actually quite easy to learn at a superficial level, once you get past the practical barriers.</p>
<p>What takes longer is to grasp the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myoK22rq1jk">APL <em>way</em></a> – how to wield it idiomatically, if you like. Learning how to solve problems the data-parallel way, no loops, no branching, is the key to writing APL that rocks.</p>
<p>Once you get used to it, APL is <em>more</em> readable than more verbose languages [ <em>citation needed</em> ]. It strips away all the fluff, leaving only the algorithmic intent. <a href="https://beyondloom.com/about/index.html">John Earnest</a>, creator of <a href="http://johnearnest.github.io/ok/index.html">oK</a>, wrote a humorous <a href="http://beyondloom.com/blog/denial.html">blog post</a> on the topic, and <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/">Aaron Hsu</a>’s presentation on <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/apl-style-patterns-and-anti-patterns-in-apl/">APL patterns and anti-patterns</a> make some of the same points in a more serious vein.</p>
<p>The last example from John Earnest’s blog post poses the hypothetical question – which is more readable, the JavaScript</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>let</span> <span>max</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>list</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>No, not really, no.</p>
<p>Whilst APL can be traced back to Iverson’s attempts at fixing some of the shortcomings of traditional mathematical notation, you don’t have to be a math-wiz to understand, or benefit from, APL. If you’re familiar with sums and products, or if you know another programming language, that’s all you need. If you <em>do</em> have a background in maths, especially in linear algebra, you’ll no doubt recognize some concepts along the way.</p>

<h2>A note on our APL subset<a href="#a-note-on-our-apl-subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dyalog’s APL dialect, which we’ll chiefly work with here, has been around for a long time, and carries with it a lot of history in the shape of backwards compatibility. APL has also evolved a lot over the years. Dyalog’s APL is really two rather different languages rolled into one: <em>traditional</em> style, which is procedural, and the newer <em>dfn</em> (pronouced <em>DEE-fun</em>) style, which is functional(ish, but let’s not quibble). For the purposes of this exercise, we’re going to pretend that the traditional style doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>When we claim that there are no if-statements or loops in APL, how come one can write</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>∇</span> <span>FizzBuzz</span> <span>end</span><span>;</span><span>i</span>

<p>which certainly looks both iffy and loopy – and dare I say even moderately readable, almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>-chic? This is an example of an APL trad-function, which we from now onwards will pretend doesn’t exist. This isn’t a value judgment so much as a practical one in the context of this book. We will not cover the traditional style, nor Dyalog’s object orientation extensions, and for simplicity’s sake, when we from now on talk about APL, take that to mean “our subset of APL”.</p>
<p>As an historical aside, the “newer” <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10007770">dfn style</a> first appeared in Dyalog 8.1, from early 1997, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Scholes">John Scholes</a>. So not <em>that</em> new.</p>
<div id="not-covered">
<h3>Not covered<a href="#not-covered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Specifically, we’re not going to cover tradfns, OO, inverses, the trigonometric functions, complex numbers, variant, I-beams, spawn, threads, isolates, format, most of the ⎕-fns, .NET integration and probably many more.</p>

<div id="is-terser-better">
<h2>Is terser better?<a href="#is-terser-better" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>APL’s <em>raison d’être</em> is to cut out the noise, to become an extension of thought. A lofty aim, for sure. APL code can be exceptionally compact; no other general-purpose programming language (apart from its siblings) gets close. No bit of code we write here will likely be longer than a few lines, and anecdotally, from personal experience, the difference runs to perhaps an order of magnitude compared with Python.</p>
<p>Is terser better? Opinions differ here. APLers, only half-jokingly, say they never scroll. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)">Arthur Whitney</a>, the creator of K, reputedly <em>hates</em> scrolling, even when writing in C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The K binary weighs in at about 50Kb. Someone asked about the interpreter source code. A frown flickered across the face of our visitor from Microsoft: what could be interesting about that? “The source is currently 264 lines of C,” said Arthur. I thought I heard a sotto voce “that’s not possible.” Arthur showed us how he had arranged his source code in five files so that he could edit any one of them without scrolling. “Hate scrolling,” he mumbled.</p></blockquote>
<p>(from <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10500700">Vector</a>)</p>
<p>Being able to see your whole implementation on a single page of code cuts down on context switching, and at least anecdotally makes mistakes easier to spot.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in the history of APL, a good read is Kromberg and Hui’s weighty paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386319">APL since 1978</a>. Morten and Roger do all their own stunts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jsoftware.com">J Software</a> maintains a rich collection of APL-related <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/">publications</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://vector.org.uk/">Vector</a> is the journal of the British APL Association.</p>
<p>A comprehensive, but now a bit outdated, reference is Legrand’s door stopper <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/documents/MasteringDyalogAPL.pdf">Mastering Dyalog APL</a>, all 800+ pages of it. It covers a lot of ground that we’re not touching upon here. Work is afoot to update <a href="https://mastering.dyalog.com">MDAPL</a> to cover a more recent version of Dyalog.</p>
<p>As you get a bit further along your path to APL mastery, the <a href="https://aplcart.info/?w">APL Cart</a> indexed idiom collection is an <em>amazing</em> resource.</p>
<p>The chat room <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52405/the-apl-orchard">APL Orchard</a> on Stack Exchange features some of the sharpest minds on the array programming circuit. It’s a welcoming place for newbies, too, and every now and then hosts so called <em>cultivations</em> – impromptu interactive lessons. A list of old cultivations is <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/52405/the-apl-orchard?tab=conversations">here</a>. Drop in and say ‘hi’ – chances are that you will be given a private APL intro lesson (in public).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aplwiki.com/">APL Wiki</a> is a rich and growing source of knowledge.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s own developer <a href="http://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm">documentation</a> is a reference - rich depth, but not the easiest place to learn new things from. <a href="https://dyalog.tv/">Dyalog TV</a> hosts Dyalog’s back catalog of webinars and lots of conference presentations with a lot of varied nuggets. There is also the Dyalog <a href="https://forums.dyalog.com/">forums</a> although a bit low-volume.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s docs for the <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/">dfns</a> workspace is a treasure trove of APL exotica. It’s what passes as a “standard library” for Dyalog, and some of it is useful for everyday coding (like <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_segs.htm">segs</a> and <a href="http://dfns.dyalog.com/n_iotag.htm">iotag</a>), and other stuff perhaps less so – but you can learn a lot by looking at its implementations to see what “real APL” looks like.</p>
<p>Speaking of “real APL”, Dyalog has a lot of public code in their <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog">github</a>, which is a great resource.</p>

<h2>Ok, I’m convinced, how do I get started?<a href="#ok-i-m-convinced-how-do-i-get-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a couple of options. To get started right now, you can head to <a href="https://tryapl.org/">TryAPL</a>, which is a web version of Dyalog APL’s latest and greatest release. That should work for most of the stuff we’ll do here.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Dyalog APL is a commercial product, not open source. Fortunately, they offer a generous non-commercial free to use clause in their licensing terms, so you can <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm">download and install Dyalog APL</a> locally without cost, as long as you’re not making money from it.</p>
</div>
<p>Dyalog consists of the APL interpreter itself, and an IDE. You’ll also need to install a font with the APL glyphs (as the “squiggles” are actually called) and a keyboard layout, depending on your platform. I am using Dyalog version 18 on MacOS, which comes with an IDE called <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/ride">RIDE</a>. On Windows you get a different IDE.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/">GNU APL</a>, and whilst there are similarities, its dialect is a bit different. GNU APL was made to be a <em>libre</em> software reimplementation of IBM’s APL2, and Dyalog has moved on quite a bit from this. The examples we present here are unlikely to all function as-is in GNU APL. Other options are <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ngn/apl">ngn/apl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/APL">dzaima/apl</a>, both hobbyist implementations that roughly implement the subset we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Dyalog also has an excellent <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-kernel">kernel</a> that allows you to use APL in the Jupyter notebook interface – which indeed is how this book is written.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve managed to get the APL keyboard layout installed, you’ll be hunting and pecking for a while. It takes a few days to learn where the most useful glyphs reside. The Dyalog IDE has the <em>language bar</em> at the top which you can also use – and hovering over a glyph will indicate where it resides on the keyboard. Here’s what my RIDE shows in terms of keyboard layout:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are you ready? Let’s begin.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-first-tentative-steps">
<h2>Our first tentative steps<a href="#our-first-tentative-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first thing we’ll do is to specify our <em>index origin</em>. In most programming languages in use today, arrays are indexed starting from 0, with a few notable exceptions (for example <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>). In APL, the index origin is a configurable option. Leaving aside for a moment as to if this is a good idea or not, it’s one of those things that sooner or later will catch you out. We’ll try to always be explicit. If, when trying to run code someone else wrote, you’re faced with an <code><span>INDEX</span> <span>ERROR</span></code>, it’s worth changing the index origin to see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Dyalog’s default index origin is 1, but we’ll set it to 0 for the least possible surprise. We won’t use anything where this actually matters for a while, but let’s get used to it from the beginning.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⎕IO</span> <span>←</span> <span>0</span> <span>⍝ Index origin gets 0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We pronounce this as “quad-eye-oh gets zero”. The left-arrow, <code><span>←</span></code>, called <em>Gets</em>, is the symbol for assignment. The green text following the <code><span>⍝</span></code> symbol is a comment. APL’s comment symbol is called <em>Lamp</em> – and a bit of an <em>aide-memoire</em> – comments should illuminate the code. On my keyboard, it lives on the comma-key, and is a useful first APL key sequence to memorise. Does it look like a lamp?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe an LED? Or a kerosene lamp, depending on how long you’ve been doing APL for. Anyway - a comment.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⍝ This line does nothing!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The usual arithmetic operations work as expected, don’t they?</p>

<p>Ok, that may have come as a surprise. It turns out that <code><span>*</span></code> is the symbol for exponentiation, not multiplication. If we want to multiply, we need to use <code><span>×</span></code> (which lives on the <code><span>-</span></code> key):</p>

<p>Ok, what about division?</p>

<p>Nope. The slash does something decidedly not-division. We’ll get back to that one later. Division is <code><span>÷</span></code>, not <code><span>/</span></code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>20</span><span>÷</span><span>4</span> <span>⍝ Division is ÷, not /</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>Negative numbers are not written with the traditional minus-sign, but with a special glyph, the <em>High minus</em>: <code><span>¯</span></code></p>

<p>Here’s another surprise:</p>

<p>In any other language, or indeed on a calculator, that would have given 17. So what’s going on here? We’re taught that multiplication goes before addition since year 1 in school. We’ve stumbled on one of the things in mathematical notation that motivated Iverson to create APL: in mathematics, operator precedence is kind of awkward and irregular.</p>
<p>In APL, everything evaluates strictly right to left. If you want to bend this evaluation order, you’ll need parentheses.</p>

<p>We can assign a value to a variable using <em>Gets</em> (<code><span>←</span></code>) that we met earlier:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>←</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>×</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>7</span> <span>⍝ a gets 17. </span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>a</span> <span>⍝ Just evaluating the variable returns its value</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⊢</span><span>a</span> <span>←</span> <span>42</span> <span>⍝ a gets 42, and please evaluate it so I can see the value</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>The glyph <code><span>⊢</span></code> is called <a href="http://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Symbols/Right%20Tack.htm"><em>Right tack</em></a>, and is a function referred to as <em>Same</em>. It simply returns its argument. Used like this it allows us to show the result of an expression even if the expression itself wouldn’t normally return a result. <em>Right tack</em> might seem like a pretty pointless function, but we’ll put it to good use later in different contexts. To “print” the value of a variable we can also use <em>Quad gets</em>, <code><span>⎕</span> <span>←</span></code>:</p>

<p>As a mnemonic, you can think of the <em>Quad</em> (<code><span>⎕</span></code>) glyph representing your computer screen (or a piece of printer paper) in this context. And for the avoidance of any doubt, the <em>Quad</em> glyph really <em>is</em> a little rectangle, and not the symbol used to show a character set mismatch on badly formed web pages.</p>
<p>APL variable names follow mostly similar rules to other programming languages – any combination of letters (upper, and lower case), digits (apart from the first character), and the underscore symbol (<code><span>_</span></code>):</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>fiftySeven</span> <span>←</span> <span>57</span>
<span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>five38</span> <span>←</span> <span>538</span>
<span>⎕</span> <span>←</span> <span>My_Variable_Name</span> <span>←</span> <span>&#39;hello world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>One convention you’ll occasionally see is the <code><span>_</span></code> variable, which is sometimes used to denote a value we don’t care about. There is nothing special about a variable called <code><span>_</span></code> – it’s just a convention.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>_</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>←</span> <span>3</span> <span>1</span> <span>4</span> <span>1</span> <span>⍝ Don&#39;t care about the third value</span>
<span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>d</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>There are two additional characters you can use in names, <code><span>⍙</span></code> and <code><span>∆</span></code>, if you feel the need to add extra spice in the lives of others reading your code. An advantage of APL’s use of glyphs instead of reserved words is that it’s impossible to create names that clash with internal or reserved words in APL.</p>
<p>You can of course use whatever naming convention that pleases you, but <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ad%C3%A1m_Brudzewsky">Adám</a> from Dyalog has written up an informal <a href="https://abrudz.github.io/style/">style guide</a> that’s useful reading. As APL lends itself to a terse style, long, rambling, Java-esque variable names are frowned upon. Here are some <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Dado/wiki/How-Not-To-Code-In-Dyalog-APL">opinionated home truths</a> from the Carlisle Group, too, to consider on your APL journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="valence">
<h2>Valence<a href="#valence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Valence</em> (sometimes called <em>arity</em>, too) refers to the way that functions expect arguments. In APL, we talk about <em>monadic</em> and <em>dyadic</em> functions and operators (and occasionally <em>niladic</em>, too).</p>
<p>There is a central tenet when writing about programming that for every mention of the word <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monad</a> you lose half your readership. We can blame Team <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Haskell</a> for that. Fear not – we’re staying right out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>. Whilst APL has monadic functions and operators, the term predates Haskell by some margin, and really refers to something different altogether. Hey, Haskell, make up your own words, will you? Just kidding, we’re huge Haskell fans.</p>
<p>APL functions can take arguments on either side, just like you’re perfectly used to with arithmetic operators in many other languages (not Lisps):</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>⍝ Infix function application, dyadic +</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>In a Lispy language, function application is always monadic, even for arithmetic, so you’d write</p>

<p>When we say that a function is <code><span>dyadic</span></code> in APL, all we mean is that the function takes both a left, and a right argument, like the <code><span>+</span></code> example above. A <code><span>monadic</span></code> function, conversely, is a function that only takes a right argument, for example, <em>Factorial</em>, <code><span>!</span></code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>7</span> <span>⍝ Monadic ! is factorial: 1×2×3×4×5×6×7</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<p>Some APL functions can be either monadic or dyadic, and in many cases these have different meanings – an endless source of <s>confusion</s> joy for the beginner. For example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>7</span><span>×</span><span>3</span> <span>⍝ Dyadic × is multiplication</span>
<span>×</span><span>¯7</span> <span>⍝ Monadic × is &#39;direction&#39;, or signum (the sign, in our case). Thanks.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>In the Dyalog IDE, if you hover over a glyph in the language bar, it will show brief examples of both its monadic and dyadic uses, where applicable. Some claim you can learn the whole language by hovering over this bar.</p>

<div><figure></figure><div>
<p>I recently bought a Xiaomi Poco F3 (128GB) at £234 from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mi.com/uk/" target="_blank">Xiaomi UK website</a>. I think it is great hardware at this price. I have been using iPhone for the last three years (XR-&gt;11-&gt;12). Once I saw this deal on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/" target="_blank">hotukdeals</a> website, I thought I should give it a try to Android after three years.  I knew it will come with a lot of bloatware and I cannot uninstall them in a normal way, but I was ready to deal with it a hard way. </p>




</div></div>



<p>Before making the final decision for the purchase, I did a quick research on Google and I found some good articles that explain how to remove bloatware on the phone via ADB shell. It seemed straight forward and I decided to purchase the phone.</p>



<p>As soon as I got my phone, I followed these articles and started removing them one by one. However, I made a big mistake and suddenly my phone locked itself. I didn’t know that I should remove my phone from my Xiaomi Account before removing the Mi Account application. I had to call Mi Customer Support but they didn’t help at all, the guy on the phone asked me to reset my Mi Account password (didn’t understand why), once he realized that didn’t work, he asked me to send my identification documents to Xiaomi so that they could remove the lock. It was funny because I was removing these applications to stop sharing my personal data. After I did a bit of research on the internet, I found the solution.  However, it was definitely annoying. </p>



<p>If you want to debloat your phone, I suggest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.naldotech.com/xiaomi-poco-f3-bloatware/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.naldotech.com/xiaomi-poco-f3-bloatware/" target="_blank">this article</a> that explains step by step. </p>



<p>Here is the list of apps that I deleted from my phone.</p>

<p>As you can see, I put alternatives for some deleted apps because they are essential to read e-mails, browse the internet or your photo gallery. I listed Micorosft alternative for Google applications, you can ignore them if you are dependent on Google services. I mostly use Microsoft applications in my daily routine, so I didn’t want to have duplication of the same application from Google. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, this list doesn’t cover all installed bloatware because some applications are breaking the phone if you remove them. For example, I couldn’t manage to uninstall Security Center, Find Device service, and POCO Launcher. I really wanted to replace POCO Launcher with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher" target="_blank">my favourite Android launcher</a>, but it has not been possible so far. When you remove POCO Launcher, it breaks the Recent Apps button’s functionality and it stops working. Uninstalling the Security Center application (com.miui.securitycenter) or the Find Device service (com.xiaomi.finddevice) puts the phone in a boot loop. </p>



<p>In addition, when you get a new system update, you may find some uninstalled applications come back, thus I would suggest to keep the list of uninstalled applications to remove them again easily.</p>



<p>I noted some commands below that you may also find useful. </p>



<pre><code># List all installed packages
pm list packages


# List all installed and uninstalled apps
pm list packages -u

# Disable app
pm disable-user app.package.name

# Re-enable it
pm enable app.package.name

# Uninstall app
pm uninstall --user 0 app.package.name

# Install uninstalled app
pm install-existing app.package.name

#Enable ADB via Network
adb tcpip 5555

#Disable ADB Network
adb usb

# Diff Files
# It is usefull to compare output between (pm list packages) and (pm list packages -u), so you can keep the uninstalled apps list easily.
diff --changed-group-format=&#39;%&gt;&#39; --unchanged-group-format=&#39;&#39; new_packages.txt  all_packages.txt</code></pre>

      <title>Looking into Zig</title>
      <link>https://ayende.com/blog/194404-A/looking-into-zig</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I think that it was the Pragmatic Programmer that recommend that you should learn a new language a year. For me, in 2020 that was Rust. I read a bunch of books about the language, I read significant amount of code and wrote some non trivial amount of code in Rust. That was sufficient to get me to grok the language, I’m not a Rust developer by any mean, but I walked with Rusty shoes for long enough to get the feeling.</p><p>This year, I decided to look into <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. Both Zig and Rust are more or less in the same space, replacing C. They couldn’t be more different, however. Zig is a small language. I spent a couple of evenings going through the language reference and that was it, I had a pretty good idea about how to do things.</p><p>The learning curve is mostly flat, and that is pretty huge. This is especially because I can’t help but compare Zig to Rust. I spent a <em>lot</em> of effort understanding Rust, but I had spent almost no cycles trying to grok Zig. It was simple, obvious and quite clear.  In terms of power, mind, I would rate both languages on roughly the same spot. You can write <em>really nice</em> code in Zig, it is just that you don’t need to bend your head into funny shapes to get the compiler to accept your code. </p><p>One of the key features for Zig is its <em>comptime</em> feature. This is a feature that allow Zig to run code at compilation time. That isn’t a new or exciting feature, to be honest, C++ had it for many years. The key difference is that Zig can use this feature for <em>code generation</em>. For example, to create a generic list, you’ll write the following code:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Note that we are writing here a function that returns a <em>type</em>, which you can then use. That approach is incredibly powerful, but at the same time, this is <em>simple</em>, it is <em>obvious</em>. </p><p>Zig is easy to learn, because there isn’t a whole lot more that is hidden from you behind the scenes.</p><p>That actually leads to another really important aspect in the design of Zig. There isn’t anything behind the scenes. For example, you cannot allocate memory in Zig, there is no global function that will do that for you. You need to do so using an allocator. That means that the fact that memory allocations can fail is pervasive throughout the API, standard library and your code. There isn’t a &#34;<em>this may fail on rare occasions</em>” scenario that you somehow need to handle, this is clear and in your face.</p><p>At the same time, Zig does a lot more to make things easier than C. I want to focus on a few important points:</p><ul><li>Zig has the concept of Errors. In the code above, the function <em>push()</em> may fail because of an allocation failure. In this case, the function will fail with a return code. That is handled by the <em>try</em> keyword, which will abort the current function and return the error. Note that errors and regular values are separate channels in Zig (there is a union mark with ! at the function declaration).</li><li>Zig has support for <SPAN color="#0000ff">defer</SPAN> and <SPAN color="#0000ff">errdefer</SPAN> keyword. The defer keyword works just as you would expect it to, at the function exit, it will run all the deferred statement in reverse order. The errdefer is a lot more interesting, because that will only run if the function exits with an error. This seemingly simple change has a huge impact on the code quality and the complexity that a developer need to keep in their head.</li><li>Zig has built-in testing, to the point where <em>test</em> is a keyword in the language.</li></ul><p>To give you some context, when I was writing C code, I literally wrote the exact same thing (manually, with macros and nastiness) in order to help me <a href="https://github.com/ayende/libgavran/blob/master/include/gavran/infrastructure.h#L74">get things done</a>. </p><p>In the same manner, the fact that allocation are explicit and managed from the top (all types that needs to allocate gets the allocator from their parents) means that you get to do some really cool things with memory. It is <em>easy</em> to say something like “this piece of code gets 10MB of memory only” and let it run like that. It also end up creating a more robust software system, I think, so memory allocations happen aren’t a rare occurrence, they happen all the time.</p><p>In general, Zig feel like a lot better C, no additional mental overhead. Compared to Rust, you can get working almost immediately and the compilation speed is <em>excellent</em>, to the point where you don’t really need to think about it. Rust makes you feel the slow compilation cost from the get go, basically, which is noticeable as your system grows bigger. </p><p>Thinking about this, I actually feel that we should compare Zig to Go, because it is closer in concept to what I think Go wanted to be. In fact, looking at the most common complaints people has against Go, Zig answers them all.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed, I’m quite enjoying working with Zig.</p><p>And as an aside, the fact that a language can implement a language server and get automatic IDE support is <em>freaking amazing</em>. You can also debug Zig code inside VS Code, for example, pretty much with no more issues than you would for native code. Zig is implemented on top of LLVM and gains a lot of the benefits from it. </p><p>One thing that kept going through my mind when I looked at all that I got out of the package is: standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

      <title>Whistleblowers expose corruption in EPA Chemical Safety Office</title>
      <link>https://theintercept.com/2021/07/02/epa-chemical-safety-corruption-whistleblowers/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="229"><div data-reactid="230"><p><u>Managers and career staff</u> in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention tampered with the assessments of dozens of chemicals to make them appear safer, according to four scientists who work at the agency. The whistleblowers, whose jobs involve identifying the potential harms posed by new chemicals, provided The Intercept with detailed evidence of pressure within the agency to minimize or remove evidence of potential adverse effects of the chemicals, including neurological effects, birth defects, and cancer.</p>
<p>On several occasions, information about hazards was deleted from agency assessments without informing or seeking the consent of the scientists who authored them. Some of these cases led the EPA to withhold critical information from the public about potentially dangerous chemical exposures. In other cases, the removal of the hazard information or the altering of the scientists’ conclusions in reports paved the way for the use of chemicals, which otherwise would not have been allowed on the market.</p></div><div data-reactid="241"><p>This is the first of a series of articles based on the four whistleblowers’ highly detailed allegations, which were supported by dozens of internal emails with supervisors, meeting summaries, and other documents. Together, the evidence they provided shows a pattern in which the EPA failed to follow the law that oversees chemical regulation, particularly the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, and depicts a workplace in which EPA staffers regularly faced retribution for following the science.</p>
<p>“The Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is broken,” the scientists wrote in a statement they provided to The Intercept and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. “The entire New Chemicals program operates under an atmosphere of fear — scientists are afraid of retaliation for trying to implement TSCA the way Congress intended, and they fear that their actions (or inactions) at the direction of management are resulting in harm to human health and the environment.”</p></div><!-- react-empty: 242 --><div data-reactid="243"><p>The four EPA staff members, who hold doctorates in toxicology, chemistry, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry, said that they told colleagues and supervisors within the agency about the interference with their work. Each of the scientists also filed complaints with either the EPA’s inspector general or the Office of Science Integrity, which has pledged to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/26/epa-corruption-cleanup/">investigate corruption</a> within the agency. But because most of their concerns remained unaddressed months after they disclosed them — and because, in each case, the altering of the record presented a potential risk to human health — the scientists said they felt compelled to make their complaints public.</p>
<h3>Maybe the Hazards Will Go Away</h3>
<p>Elyse Osterweil, one of the four scientists, said she was at first reluctant to speak up about the intense pressure she faced from her supervisors to remove references to potential toxicity from the assessments of new chemicals. The assessments, which use animal studies to gauge a chemical’s potential risk to humans, can lead the agency to place limits on its use — or to ban it entirely. In the case of one substance that Osterweil was reviewing in February of this year, the animal studies suggested serious potential for harm. Rats exposed to a single dose of the chemical had become lethargic, lost weight, and had trouble moving. Some became comatose, and others died.</p>
<p>“Usually with this type of acute study, there are no effects,” said Osterweil. “So this was a red flag to me that we needed further information.” But when Osterweil said in a meeting that she needed more data to complete her hazard assessment report, one of her supervisors responded with a series of questions. “She kept asking me, ‘Look at the data, look at the data, look at it again, tell me what you see,’” Osterweil said of her supervisor. “I knew she wanted me to make the hazards go away, and she even said that: ‘Why don’t you take a look at the actual study data again, and maybe the hazards will go away?’”</p>
<p>Although she knew she didn’t have enough information to say that the chemical didn’t pose a risk, Osterweil seriously considered giving in to the pressure to deem it safe. “There was a time when I thought, ‘Well, maybe I should let this one go and just pick my battles,’” she said. “But I just couldn’t.”</p>
<p>A chemist named Martin Phillips faced similar pushback when he was assessing a mixture of compounds in January of 2020. One component of the product, which was to be used in cleaning solutions, is a chemical that caused birth defects and miscarriage in experiments on rats. Phillips and another risk assessor noted the developmental effects in the chemical’s hazard assessment, which must by law then be added to the chemical’s safety data sheet, a document the Occupational Safety and Health Administration uses to communicate risk to workers. But the company that had submitted the product for approval balked at the requirement. And the day after the assessment Phillips wrote was finalized, a representative of the company who had recently worked in the same division of the EPA met with several of Phillips’s colleagues and his supervisor, whom she had known from her time at the agency. Phillips wasn’t invited to attend the meeting. The following day, another assessment of the chemical was uploaded into the EPA’s computer system without Phillips’s consent or knowledge. The new version omitted the information about the birth defects and miscarriages.</p>
<p>When he learned of the new assessment, Phillips asked that the original one be restored. The meeting that followed was hostile, with a senior science adviser in the office calling Phillips “passive aggressive” for being so concerned about the assessment. While some information about the chemical was restored in the assessment after Phillips complained about its removal, the warning about its potential to cause developmental toxicity, which would alert pregnant people to these harms, never made it into the safety data sheet.</p>
<p>Phillips had his work revised without his knowledge on other occasions too. In one case in 2019, he was asked to assess a chemical even though the manufacturer had not submitted studies. Phillips followed the EPA’s written guidance for such situations and used toxicity numbers for the class to which the chemical belongs. When he plugged in the proper values, Phillips calculated that the likely exposures to the chemical would exceed the agency’s safety limit by more than 15,000 times. Three months after he submitted the document with this conclusion, he noticed that a new assessment of the chemical had been uploaded to the EPA’s computer system. In this new assessment, which deviated from guidelines, the assessor found that the chemical posed only a slight risk and that workers who used the material could mitigate the danger by wearing protective gear.</p>
<p>The second assessment, which found the chemical not likely to pose harm, was finalized in August of 2020. “So it went from being over 15,000 times over the safe dose to you just need to wear a dust mask and you’ll be fine,” said Phillips.</p>
<h3>Siding with the Company</h3>
<p>All four scientists said the pressure to downplay the risk of chemicals increased during their time in the division. “We started getting increasing pressure to use the wrong exposure metrics,” said Sarah Gallagher, who joined the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, which is within Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, in May 2019. (The Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is also home to the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/30/epa-pesticides-exposure-opp/">Office of Pesticide Programs</a>.)</p>
<p>Gallagher protested changes in multiple risk assessments between March and June of 2020. Her supervisors asked her to represent the developmental effects of one chemical, which included the reduction of fetal weight in animal studies, as effects on pregnant rats themselves rather than direct effects on the fetus. Such a mischaracterization would mean that the risk the chemical poses to a developing human fetus would not be reflected by its safety data sheet. Gallagher refused to make the change.</p></div><div data-reactid="251"><p>One month later, she was reassigned to another office.</p>
<p>Even after her transfer, documents she had written while in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention continued to be altered, including an assessment of a <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/">PFAS compound</a>. Because there was limited information available about the chemical, she had looked to studies of similarly structured compounds, as is EPA policy. In this case, one of the closest analogues was <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-teflon-toxin/">PFOA</a>, an industrial chemical that poses both cancer and developmental risks, as Gallagher noted in her assessment. But one of her former supervisors had instructed another scientist to remove her reference to PFOA from the assessment and replace it with another, less toxic chemical to gauge its safety. The change resulted in a 33-fold underestimation of the compound’s risk, according to Gallagher.</p>
<p>William Irwin, another of the four whistleblowers, who has worked at the EPA for over 11 years as a toxicologist, was also moved out of the office after repeatedly resisting pressure to change his assessments to favor industry. Irwin said that while it had seemed obvious that the pressure stemmed from chemical companies, the science adviser in the office made the point irrefutably clear during an argument over one particular chemical assessment.</p>
<p>“At one point, he was shouting at me to change it,” Irwin said of the science adviser, who was urging him to eliminate hazards noted in the assessment. “He basically was siding with the company, shouting at me that ‘the company went apeshit when they saw this document.’” Irwin replied, “Well, that’s the assessment.”</p></div><blockquote data-reactid="252"><span data-reactid="253"></span><p>“He basically was siding with the company.”</p></blockquote><div data-reactid="255"><p>Irwin didn’t make the changes. “I actually added extra hazards to it,” he said. “It was also a carcinogen.” Several months after that encounter, the antagonism stopped when Irwin was transferred out of the office. The scientist saw the move as a last resort for his managers. “I have three board certifications in toxicology, so it was hard for them to say, ‘William, you’re stupid,’ and so instead they just kicked me out of the program.”</p>
<p>Phillips was also transferred in September 2020. Meanwhile, Osterweil continues to work in the office, where she said disputes over chemical assessments and retaliation against her have continued unabated.</p>
<p>The ongoing issues are evidence that the pressures on chemical assessors within the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention have persisted even under the Biden administration, according to Kyla Bennett, director of science policy at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, or PEER, an organization that provides support to whistleblowers and helped the scientists draft their disclosure document. “The problems in OCSPP are not due solely to the Trump administration and its appointees,” said Bennett. “The issues faced by our clients occurred before Trump took office, during the Trump years, and continue now.”</p>
<p>On Monday, PEER submitted its complaint to the EPA inspector general; Michal Freedhoff, assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention; and Khanna, asking that they conduct an audit to identify risk assessments that were altered without the knowledge or consent of the risk assessor; investigate apparent violations of the EPA’s records management policy, in which documents were altered; and evaluate the process that allowed these changes to be made and remain uncorrected.</p>
<p>Khanna provided a statement to The Intercept applauding the whistleblowers. “Clean, cancer-free air and water still isn’t a given in our country,” Khanna wrote. “I will continue to monitor this situation and ensure that these scientists’ concerns are addressed to ensure that toxic or harmful chemicals are not going out to the market without the appropriate health and safety warnings. I am so proud of the work of our Environmental Subcommittee is doing to create a healthier world.”</p>
<p>Asked about the complaint, the EPA wrote in an email that “This Administration is committed to investigating alleged violations of scientific integrity. It is critical that all EPA decisions are informed by rigorous scientific information and standards. As one of his first acts as Administrator, Administrator Regan issued a memorandum outlining concrete steps to reinforce the agency’s commitment to science.</p>
<p>“EPA takes seriously all allegations of violations of scientific integrity. EPA’s scientific integrity official and scientific integrity team members will thoroughly investigate any allegation of violation of EPA’s scientific integrity policy that they receive and work to safeguard EPA science. Additionally, EPA is currently reviewing agency policies, processes, and practices to ensure that the best available science and data inform Agency decisions. EPA is committed to fostering a culture of evaluation and continuous learning that promotes an open exchange of differing scientific and policy positions. Additionally, retaliation against EPA employees for reporting violations alleged to have occurred will not be tolerated in this administration. EPA leadership are reviewing these complaints, and any appropriate action will be taken.”</p>
<p>While such complaints are usually kept confidential, by Tuesday many mangers in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention had somehow obtained a copy of the whistleblowers’ allegations. “The fact that EPA released our clients’ names is inappropriate and troubling,” said Bennett. “They’ve been put in an incredibly uncomfortable situation. This gives the managers the chance to circle the wagons trying to go after them.”</p>
<p>For the whistleblowers, the release of their names is just the latest battle in a war they’ve been waging for years. For Gallagher, a scientist with expertise in chemistry and toxicology, the combative turn of her career has been a surprise. “Like a lot of us who are in this, we came to work at the EPA because I wanted to preserve the environment for our children’s children,” said Gallagher. “It’s infuriating that I have to push back against managers to do that.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is definitely going too far, and I would have to end our advisory relationship,» she wrote. He should «tone down his political expression immediately», she added. She had «no desire to receive emails like this because of one of my doctoral students.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrd0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber had to read the message twice. He had been tweeting for just 10 days, and had fewer than 10 followers. No question, he had been harshly critical of the Chinese government. For example, on March 21, he had posted, in English: «#CCP made fighting #COVID-19 plan B. Only to be executed if Plan A – covering it up – fails. Those are the actions of paranoid cowards. They neither deserve my respect nor gratitude #ChinaLiedPeopleDied».</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fc12sa0q1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Yet the student was shocked. This was supposed to be «neo-Nazi-like» content? He was sure there had been a misunderstanding. He replied at 11:11 p.m., wanting to know who the «angry emails from China» were from. He asked if his professor had even read the tweets, and accused her of having been «taken in by Chinese government’s increasingly aggressive censorship.» Still, he deactivated his Twitter account.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrf0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">He didn’t hear anything more for almost 48 hours. Then the professor got back to him. Her tone was distant, and she didn’t respond to Gerber&#39;s questions. She had copied his second doctoral adviser on this email, writing that she wished him good luck with his «Chinese studies». However, there was at that time «no supervisory relationship between you and us,» the message read. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrf1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">It was the last email Gerber would receive though his St. Gallen account. The next day, he found he couldn’t access his messages. An IT technician told him on the phone that his account didn’t exist. «It felt like I had been purged overnight,» Gerber said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrg0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Education is a key aspect of China&#39;s global power strategy. The Chinese government wants to control the country’s image throughout the world. To this end, it exerts influence abroad, and has no compunction about engaging in repressive actions. At the beginning of this year, for example, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/international/china-verhaengt-sanktionen-gegen-europa-was-bezwecken-sie-ld.1608345">banned all researchers</a> from Europe’s largest research institute specializing in China from entering the country. Such demonstrations of power intimidate researchers around the world – especially if they depend on traveling to China for work. This can lead them to preemptively avoid topics that could be perceived as critical of the Chinese government.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbp7q0vt1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">With more than 50 cooperation agreements currently in place, Swiss and Chinese universities today have close ties. Swiss researchers benefit from stays abroad, and are granted access to large amounts of data that proves useful in their work, for example in the development of cancer therapies. But what is the price of this cooperation?</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidro0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Only a few people in Switzerland have sought to disclose and criticize Chinese attempts to influence universities here. However, Gerber&#39;s case demonstrates that China&#39;s aggressive foreign policy can in fact influence how academics in Switzerland publicly express themselves, and how they deal with critical comments from their students. It shows that some researchers are willing to restrict their own and others’ activities in order to avoid upsetting China.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbouggon0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Oliver Gerber is not in fact the student’s real name. Because his partner&#39;s family lives in China and fears retaliation if his name appears in the newspaper, he asked to remain anonymous. For this reason, the professor too has not been mentioned by name. However, the NZZ has spoken directly with both sides. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidro1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber accuses St. Gallen of kicking him out because of his critical tweets. The NZZ has copies of these tweets, as well as Gerber&#39;s correspondence with the professor and other St. Gallen representatives. They largely support the position taken by the former Ph.D. student. However, the University of St. Gallen insists on a different version of events. According to this telling, Gerber himself decided to terminate his studies at the university.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrp0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">How does St. Gallen justify this? From whom did the professor receive the «angry emails from China»? And what does this mean for academic freedom and freedom of expression in Switzerland?</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgidrq0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The backstory</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfo90" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber has a background in the natural sciences. You can tell this by the way he tells his story: structured, meticulously documented and with a certain distance. As though it had all happened to someone else.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fboo3d7b1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Nonetheless, he betrays his continued preoccupation with the events by how often he repeats the sentence «I can&#39;t believe something like this happened in Switzerland.» And no wonder: his three years of research have been destroyed because of a tweet.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfoa0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber began his doctoral studies at St. Gallen in the spring of 2017. His research was in the field of environmental pollution. His topic was a delicate one for China, yet it was clear to Gerber early on that he wanted to understand the country, and wanted to do research on the ground, not just from a desk in St. Gallen. He applied for grants, supported in this effort by his adviser. In her letter of recommendation, she wrote: «He is capable of pursuing a first-rate research career.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbok69o81" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">He ultimately received a fellowship from the Chinese government to a university in Wuhan, for three years instead of just one, as originally planned. In September 2018, he flew to Wuhan, quickly made friends and fell in love. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fboo58611" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">A Chinese professor there told him that his Ph.D. topic was «boring» – a euphemism for being too critical of the government. As a part of his fellowship, he also had to attend classes, and says today he couldn’t believe how much censorship took place in the course of everyday university life. When he submitted an essay on reeducation camps, he received the lowest grade possible. In an email to his professor in St. Gallen, he wrote: «Maybe I&#39;ve just been unlucky.»</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfh36s0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">Gerber met his girlfriend during his research stay in China.

In 2018, almost half a million foreign students were studying in the country. Just under 13% had received a scholarship or other funding from the Chinese government. In offering such assistance, China specifically selects students from countries in which it has political interests.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmp1ed11" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">China&#39;s economy is growing rapidly. The country is becoming increasingly aggressive in its foreign policy. Western media routinely report on human rights violations such as the prison camps in Xinjiang. All of this raises fears about China. The government is aware of this.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbp9tok91" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">But it also knows that many people are fascinated by China&#39;s history. To feed this interest, China created the Confucius Institutes. There are more than 500 of these facilities worldwide, in over 150 countries. Located on the campuses of foreign universities, the institutes are tasked with providing Chinese language instruction and teach students about the country’s culture. They report to the Chinese Ministry of Education, which provides personnel and funds. There is only one such institute left in Switzerland, at the University of Geneva. A second was based at the University of Basel, but this was closed last autumn. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfol0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In the United States too, a quarter of the country’s Confucius Institutes have been shut down in recent years. Universities no longer wanted to give legitimacy to an institution that defended fundamentally different values. While research freedom and the freedom of expression are important fundamental principles in the West, education in China is highly politicized under the rule of Xi Jinping, the head of state and the Chinese Communist Party’s leader . For example, the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai has replaced the term «freedom of expression» in its statutes with a reference to «Xi Jinping&#39;s socialist ideology.»</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfol1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The momentous decision</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfon0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Just before Christmas 2019, Gerber flew back to Switzerland, originally planning no more than a short family visit. But then the coronavirus pandemic broke out. On January 23, 2020, a strict lockdown was imposed in Wuhan. Gerber stayed in Switzerland. At the time, he was starting to think about what to do after finishing his doctorate, and his girlfriend advised him to start networking on social media.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfoq0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">However, before Gerber opened his Twitter account, he sought advice from his professor, knowing that she was active on the social network. He asked via email: «Do you engage in some degree of self-censorship? Do you think it would be too dangerous for me to open a Twitter account?»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfor0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Although he received no response, he began tweeting in mid-March. At this point, the world was focused on China as the site of the coronavirus pandemic’s initial outbreak. Gerber saw an opportunity to position himself as a China expert. At the same time, he was also emotionally affected by what was happening in Wuhan – a city to which he wanted to return, and where he had friends and a partner. His Twitter channel became an outlet for these feelings, and he criticized the Chinese government&#39;s initial cover-up of the Corona epidemic, the repression in Xinjiang and Xi Jinping himself.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfos0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">His girlfriend was shocked when she saw some of the tweets. Talking with him on the telephone, she begged him to stop. Not because she necessarily disagreed with anything. But because she was worried about retaliation by the Chinese government. «I&#39;m in Switzerland, not China,» Gerber replied. «I can say what I want here.»</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfot0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>Swiss universities and their China connection</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmpck301" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Cooperation between Chinese and Swiss universities has expanded in recent years. The University of St. Gallen has 15 such agreements, almost twice as many as ETH Zurich. For the last eight years, St. Gallen has also been home to a «China Competence Center,» the aim of which is to «strengthen and deepen productive relations with China». Asked about the issue, a St. Gallen representative indicated that the institution has never encountered any problems in its relationships with Chinese universities. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfov0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In a report issued last year, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/63412.pdf">Swiss intelligence service</a> warned that Chinese spies might be masquerading as students or researchers. The issue of links between Swiss universities and China was also recently taken up in the Swiss parliament. Two parliamentarians submitted official queries to the government asking about the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20213288">principles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20213289">guidelines</a> governing these cooperative university relationships. The Federal Council, the seven-member executive body that heads Switzerland’s federal government, replied that universities had to decide for themselves what cooperative ventures they pursued. In the response, it added that there had been no «concrete reports of influence in terms of curtailing academic freedoms.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgjfp20" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p"><a href="https://www.nzz.ch/folio/ich-weiss-nicht-auf-welcher-seite-jemand-steht-ld.1623226">Ralph Weber</a>, a China expert and professor at the University of Basel, is critical of Swiss universities for often failing to perform sufficient due diligence on their foreign partners – especially those from China. In some sectors of the economy, he notes, it is normal procedure to examine the constraints under which a partner operates when it comes to important business. «I don’t see an approach like this being taken at many universities,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgk33g0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In Weber&#39;s view, clear rules – and above all red lines – are needed. Otherwise, he says, there is considerable risk that Swiss universities will simply say «This is China, there&#39;s no way around it,» and in doing so, compromise their own values. However, Swiss universities seem to have recognized the problem. Under the auspices of the main umbrella organization for Swiss universities, they are now for the first time seeking to develop joint guidelines for cooperative ventures with China.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgk33i0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The conflict<br/></span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri00" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">After Gerber read the email in which his professor wrote that there was no longer «a supervisory relationship,» he turned desperately to his father. His father in turn contacted a lawyer. That same evening, on the advice of his girlfriend, Gerber compiled a dossier of emails between himself and his most important contacts at St. Gallen. In the following weeks, his lawyer wrote several letters to the university administration. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfjt9a0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">After the first e-mail from his professor, Gerber still believed there had been a misunderstanding. The second email left him distraught.</h2> <!----></p></figcaption> <!----></figure> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbpbsnjd1" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber&#39;s goal was to be able to continue studying at St. Gallen. But the university argued that the professor hadn’t kicked him out; rather, he had been deregistered at his own request quite some time ago. In fact, as of the fall 2019 semester, Gerber had been officially enrolled only at the university in China, not at St. Gallen. He had been advised to take this tack by the St. Gallen doctoral program manager. In an email, the manager had said this would ensure that the maximum time allowed for pursuit of the degree would not expire while Gerber was in China. «Deregistration allows you to keep all your options on the table,» the email had said. The reregistration process would be like applying all over again – but with the support of his professor, this would be no problem, the program manager said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri40" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber followed this advice and temporarily deregistered at St. Gallen. «A wise decision,» the program manager wrote. For the time being, however, Gerber was still listed as a doctoral student on the university&#39;s website. His professor continued to advise him as before – until the complaints about his tweet. For example, following a Skype meeting, she asked him to send her an outline of his work. On February 21, 2020, a few weeks before she declared the supervisory relationship to be nonexistent, she wrote: «It&#39;s great how well you&#39;ve already progressed in China!» <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri60" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber could document all of this. Yet throughout the spring of 2020, the university stuck to its position that when the trouble over his tweets broke out, he had long since ceased to be a St. Gallen doctoral student. For this reason too, the university&#39;s ombudsman declined to handle the case. The university informed Gerber that he would have to completely reapply if he wanted to continue studying at the institution. Moreover, he would have to find a new professor to advise him.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri70" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">For her part, it was only upon inquiries from the NZZ that the professor indicated which tweet the «angry emails from China» comment referred to, and who they had come from. She said she had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student doing research at a Canadian university. This email was made available to the NZZ, but the name of the sender was blacked out – at the request of the writer, according to the professor.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri80" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The writer accuses Gerber of a «racist attack on the Chinese people.» He was referring to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user&#39;s tweet. It depicted a comic character that had been altered and had stereotyped Chinese features, with yellow skin tone and slit eyes. This drawing circulated on social media in the spring of 2020, and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber said he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The underlying topic had been China&#39;s stance toward Taiwan and Hong Kong. «In retrospect, I realize I didn&#39;t question the rendering of the Chinese person enough,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkri90" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The professor said she had informed Gerber that he was no longer allowed to represent himself as a St. Gallen doctoral student on Twitter, because he had deregistered the previous year. «This has nothing whatsoever to do with the issues of China or censorship,» she said. She said it was only an oversight that she had used the plural in referring to «angry emails from China,» despite receiving only one email – and that one originating from Canada. She had wanted to make it clear that further reactions could be expected. The phrase «I would have to end our advisory relationship» had referred to the informal advice she had provided «at the doctoral student&#39;s request,» she said. The fact that Gerber had continued to be listed as a student on the St. Gallen website until the end of March was due simply to an oversight, she added.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkric0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The professor went on to explain that the relationship of trust had already been strained, because Gerber had «lost his temper» during a conversation a year earlier, and had told her that he no longer wanted to continue his doctorate at St. Gallen in any form, and no longer needed her as a doctoral supervisor. Gerber disputes this. He had at one time simply considered pursuing a dual degree from both universities, St. Gallen and the university in China, he said. In the emails between the two from 2019, which were obtained by NZZ, there is no hint of tension.</p> <!----><!----> <figure id="id-doc-1fbpfk8af0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="image"><p></p> <figcaption><p><h2 data-nzz-tid="image-description-caption" data-team-image-caption="true">The professor wrote of «angry emails from China.» Later, she said that only one person had contacted her: a Chinese doctoral student from Canada.</h2> <!----></p></figcaption> <!----></figure> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbro92520" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Whether the professor received «angry emails from China», as she herself wrote, cannot be conclusively judged. However, it is clear that China can exert pressure through its visa issuance policy. The professor&#39;s first email clearly shows that she feared she would no longer be able to obtain a Chinese visa because of Gerber&#39;s tweets. That also explains the rapidity with which she cut off contact – regardless of the fact that Gerber immediately deactivated his Twitter profile. Were there additional economic interests at play? St. Gallen says that the professor&#39;s department has never received funding or other forms of support from Chinese companies or other Chinese actors.</p> <!----><!----> <h2 data-team-subtitle="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrid0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="subtitle"><span>The aftermath</span></h2> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrif0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">How does St. Gallen see the case today? Vice-President of External Relations Ulrich Schmid said: «St. Gallen is unreservedly committed to the freedoms of teaching and research. However, the freedom of research is in no way implicated here, since the issue concerns private statements by the former doctoral student, which he published via a social network.» Schmid said he could not comment on the tweets. «However, the fact that they obviously generated considerable discussion, and were perceived as racist, justifies the professor&#39;s desire to distance herself clearly from them.»</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrih0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Schmid said the support provided to Gerber after his deregistration had been «purely voluntary,» and that it had an «informal character.» It was the professor&#39;s «clear right» to terminate this at any time if the relationship of trust was disturbed. Furthermore, Schmid said, Gerber had not submitted a complete application for his renewed enrollment, but had instead attempted to force his reenrollment. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrij0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">In the early summer of 2020, Gerber decided to abandon the legal effort. He said he didn&#39;t complete the enrollment application because he couldn&#39;t find a new adviser: «There was no other professor in the same department with whom I could have finished my work. Changing topics would have meant starting from scratch again after three and a half years. That was out of the question for me.» <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbmgkrim0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">The former student thought long and hard about whether to go public with his case. He now hopes for a debate on how China is influencing Swiss universities. <br/></p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fbonoue11" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Today, Gerber says starting to tweet was a mistake. The fact that he could lose three years of research work because of this still leaves him stunned. Yes, he was publicly critical of China, and once shared a cartoon that he would not share today. «But I didn’t do anything wrong,» he said.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-paragraph="" id="id-doc-1fc39qfq41" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="p">Gerber has now given up pursuit of his doctorate. «I don&#39;t want to have to censor myself, certainly not in Switzerland,» he said. In the meantime, he has found a job that has nothing to do with China.</p> <!----><!----> <p data-team-footnote="" id="id-doc-1fbmmsmv30" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="footnote" data-vars-danzz-last-article-element="true">* Real name known to editors.</p> <!----><!---->  <!----><!----> <p data-team-footnote="" id="id-doc-1fc7u5ghv0" content="" pagetype="Article" componenttype="footnote" data-vars-danzz-last-article-element="true">The NZZ is one of the preeminent news sources in the German-speaking world, with a tradition of independent, high-quality journalism reaching back over 240 years.</p> <!----></section>  <!---->  <!----> <!---->  <!----> <!----> <!----> </div></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Problem with Perceptual Hashes</title>
      <link>https://rentafounder.com/the-problem-with-perceptual-hashes/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Apple just <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">announced</a> that they will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing">“perceptual hashing”</a> to detect illegal photos on iPhones. I have some experience to share on this technology.</p>
<p>At my company, we use “perceptual hashes” to find copies of an image where each copy has been slightly altered. This is in the context of stock photography, where each stock agency (e.g. Getty Images, Adobe Stock, Shutterstock) adds their own watermark, the image file ID, or sharpens the image or alters the the colours slightly, for example by adding contrast. For our customers, i.e. the photographers who upload their photos to these agencies and sell them through their platform, we need to find all of their photos’ copies on those agencies. We use perceptual hashes to find them.</p>
<p>Most publicly documented perceptual hash algorithms work by reducing the image data to a bit vector (the “hash”) which is then compared to a database of hashes, typically by applying a distance metric, which is, in many casess the so-called Hamming Distance, the number of bits by which the two hashes differ. Image data reduction usually includes resizing the image, discarding its colour information, filtering in the frequency domain (often using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">DCT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet">Wavelets</a>), in some cases (supposedly the proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoDNA">PhotoDNA</a> algorithm) calculating a histogram of these values, and in <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf">Apple’s case</a> using a convolutional neural network to reduce image information to a floating point vector, then quantizing that vector into the final hash bits.</p>
<p>For our product, I’ve evaluated <a href="http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html">Average Hash</a>, <a href="https://www.phash.org/">pHash</a>, <a href="http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html">dHash</a>, and the algorithm described in the paper <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/mrquery.pdf">Fast Multiresolution Image Querying</a> which is also used in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imgseek/">imgSeek</a> software. We currently have to match approximately 100 million photos and found that the latter one worked best, i.e. it resulted in the fewest false positives and fewest false negatives. (I published a Golang implementation <a href="https://github.com/rivo/duplo">here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-problem">So What’s the Problem?</h3>
<p>None of these algorithms are waterproof. Let me give you an example of a false positive. We try to find a copy of the <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/de/221271979">following image</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best the algorithm could find was <a href="https://de.depositphotos.com/300295390/stock-photo-watercolor-heliconius-doris-butterfly.html">this image</a>:</p>

<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that these algorithms will fail sometimes. But in the context of 100 million photos, they do fail quite often. And they don’t fail in acceptable ways: It’s easy to see that the general composition of these two images is similar (beige background with dark accents in the top right center). But their content is completely different. The collisions encountered with other hashing algorithms look different, often in unexpected ways, but collisions exist for all of them.</p>
<p>When we deal with perceptual hashes, there is no fixed threshold for any distance metric, that will cleanly separate the false positives from the false negatives. In the example above, we can apply a stricter threshold but this will cause actual copies of many photos to go undetected. Simple modifications such as watermarks or slight colour corrections would lead to the algorithm concluding that “these two images are not the same”.</p>
<p>Especially when a Hamming Distance is used to compare hashes, there is not a lot of room to fine tune the threshold. Let’s assume we’re dealing with 256-bit hashes: The Hamming Distances for which two images are the same are likely within just a few bits, i.e. a Hamming Distance of, say, 16, will already indicate a lot of differences. In the context of millions of pictures, moving the Hamming Distance threshold up or down by one will have a huge effect on the number of false positives or false negatives generated.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-affect-apples-new-technology">How Does This Affect Apple’s New Technology?</h3>
<p>Even at a Hamming Distance threshold of 0, that is, when both hashes are identical, I don’t see how Apple can avoid tons of collisions, given the large number of pictures taken every year (<a href="https://blog.mylio.com/how-many-photos-will-be-taken-in-2021-stats/">1.4 trillion in 2021</a>, now break this down by iPhone market share and country, the number for US iPhone users will still be extremely big).</p>
<p>According to Apple, a low number of positives (false or not) will not trigger an account to be flagged. But again, at these numbers, I believe you will still get too many situations where an account has multiple photos triggered as a false positive. (Apple says that probability is “1 in 1 trillion” but it is unclear how they arrived at such an estimate.) These cases will be manually reviewed. That is, according to Apple, an Apple employee will then look at your (flagged) pictures. Does Apple have the manpower in place to iron out their algorithm’s shortcomings? We can only hope so.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Perceptual hashes are messy. The simple fact that image data is reduced to a small number of bits leads to collisions and therefore false positives. When such algorithms are used to detect criminal activities, especially at Apple scale, many innocent people can potentially face serious problems.</p>
<p>My company’s customers are slightly inconvenienced by the failures of perceptual hashes (we have a UI in place that lets them make manual corrections). But when it comes to CSAM detection and its failure potential, that’s a whole different ball game. Needless to say, I’m quite worried about this.</p>

<h2>Part I</h2>
<p><span>I want to kick this off with a confession: <strong>Richard Stallman</strong> has always been one of my heroes! Richard Matthew Stallman, also known as RMS, is considered one of the greatest hackers in computer history. The software he wrote in the 1970s is still being used in the present day. On the big screen, when we see a bearded hacker who spends his nights by his computer and sleeping on a bed next to it during the day – we’re actually looking at the mythological figure of Stallman, With his untidy beard and his long grayish hair. He was partly an inspiration for this cliché.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1599"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1599">Richard Stallman (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Stallman is also regarded as the father of the Open Source movement, a social-technological phenomenon that inspired the creation of many of the programs we use daily: the Android operating system, WordPress, the Firefox browser and many many others. By the way, Stallman very much <strong>doesn’t like to be called “the father of the Open Source movement.”</strong> We’ll get to that later in the show.</span></p>
<p><span>When I decided to write an entire episode about the history of the Open Source movement, I also took the opportunity to make an old dream come true by interviewing Richard Stallman himself.</span></p>
<p><span><em>[the phone rings, Richard picks up]</em></span></p>
<p><span>This interview – how should I put it – didn’t go as I had expected it. The conversation with him made me doubt a few of the premises regarding the world of technology, while illuminating sides of his personality that I never knew about.</span></p>
<h3><span>Richard Matthew Stallman</span></h3>
<p><span>Richard Stallman was born in the US in 1953. Even as a child, he demonstrated an <strong>anti-establishment</strong> attitude and rebelliousness. His behavioral problems made him switch schools every now and then, and that left him, socially, as a bit of an outsider among children his age. He even admits that he never learned how to get along properly with other people.</span></p>
<p><span>Computers, though, were a completely different story. Believe it or not, as an elementary student, Stallman read computer manuals and wrote software. Of course, it was the 1950s and 60s, days when computer access was a rare privilege – so the software he wrote was all on paper. Only in high school did he actually get to SEE a real computer, but at that point, he already knew computers much better than most teenagers. To say that Richard Stallman is <strong>a brilliant person</strong> is an understatement.</span></p>
<p><span>He studied physics at Harvard. Although he enjoyed the classes, there was one thing that upset him greatly. There weren’t many computer terminals in Harvard back then, and students were desperate for any computer time they could get. Many professors held computer terminals inside their offices – but they would often lock the doors at night. It was <strong>a huge waste</strong>: the terminals went unused for many hours, like precious electronic stones – while outside there were those who really, really wanted to use them.</span></p>
<h3>MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab</h3>
<p><span>Not far from Harvard is MIT, the world famous technological university. During his studies at Harvard, Stallman visited the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – where he witnessed <strong>a completely different attitude</strong>. At MIT, computer terminals were considered a common resource, and no one had a direct and distinct ownership over their machines. If one of the professors kept a computer terminal in his office and dared to lock the door behind him – the students would literally break open the door – sometimes with makeshift battering rams – and take the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was the home for many young students who were passionate about technology. At the time they were known as “<strong>hackers</strong>”, although the term had a slightly different meaning compared to today: Back then, “hackers” were those who liked to research deeply into the guts of any system and change it. It certainly did not have the negative connotation it holds today, of someone who steals information or does damage. The hackers of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory wanted to create interesting things using the tools they had, and they did not have any tolerance or patience towards those who tried to restrain them. For Stallman, this was<strong> love at first sight</strong> – and he quickly joined the lab.</span></p>
<h3>Hackers</h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/MIT_2012-07-18.jpg/320px-MIT_2012-07-18.jpg"></a><figcaption>MIT main campus (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Life at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was intense. The professors and their students used the lab during the day, and as soon as they left, the hackers took over and worked all night. They ordered Chinese food at three a.m. and continued working on their software until dropping onto folding beds to catch some sleep. Together with other programmers, Stallman developed software and ideas that are considered to be <strong>milestones in the history of modern technology</strong>. For example, he created an important algorithm for the artificial intelligence field, and a hugely popular text editor named Emacs.</span></p>
<p><span>Stallman loved every minute at the lab. When he graduated from Harvard – making the Dean’s list, of course – he registered for his master’s degree at MIT, mainly so he could continue working at the lab. He was enchanted by the comradery and the spirit of cooperation; the lab was a place where people worked together for a common cause and for the good of the public.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“The atmosphere was very wheeling and cooperative. We were using and developing our own operating system, which for me was the absolute ideal job. I was getting paid to do what I would absolutely love! I was doing this job as a part of a group of other developers without a sharp boundary. There were some other people who were also the staff at the lab, improving the system, but anyone was welcome to improve the system! We were happy to get contributions from anybody, and they didn’t even have to have a connection with MIT. We were happy when anybody else showed up and started using the system if he did anything that was thoughtful. And if they started to contribute to the system too – well, that was great! And we were happy to share our software with people outside MIT. We were glad when they thought it was useful.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>There was such transparency and openness within the lab, that people often <strong>read and answered each other’s e-mails</strong>. Stallman told the following story in a talk he gave in 1986:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I remember one interesting scandal where somebody sent a request for help in using [a certain program] that was developed at MIT. He sent to one of the people working on it a request for some help, and he got an answer a few hours later from somebody else. He was horrified, he sent a message “so-and-so must be reading your mail, can it be that mail files aren’t properly protected on your system?” “Of course, no file is protected on our system. What’s the problem? You got your answer sooner; why are you unhappy? Of course we read each other’s mail so we can find people like you and help them”. Some people just don’t know when they’re well off.”</span></em></p>
<hr/>

<h3><span>The Roots of GNU &amp; the Free Software Foundation</span></h3>
<p><span>But this ideal environment didn’t last forever, and MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was <strong>a victim of its own success</strong>. The majority of computer users during the 1950s and 60’s were from the academic world and they were used to sharing ideas – and software – with each other. But during the late 1970s, when computers began spreading in the business sector, many new companies developed proprietary software for industrial needs, and it was only natural that these companies offered their software to customers in exchange for a payment, instead of giving them away free. This signaled an end to the culture of free software exchange. These companies also offered very high salaries to the MIT hackers, whose talents were now in high demand. Within several years the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory became empty. Not physically, of course – professors and their students still used the facility, but the anarchist hackers were nowhere in sight.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Richard Stallman stayed at the lab, he soon realized that <strong>the spirit of the place had changed</strong>. The remaining programmers weren’t as thrilled to share knowledge and creative solutions with each other. In the brave new business world, knowledge was power. Knowledge was money. The high-quality software that programmers used to write for their own common use at the lab was replaced by mediocre and proprietary software; and as for reading other people’s e-mails, that was simply out of the question.</span></p>
<p><span>Stallman continued his daily tasks, but something inside him wished to rekindle the spark of the majestic atmosphere the lab once had. In the early 1980s Stallman found a way to do so, and the key to rekindling the spark was by “<strong>sharing</strong>.”</span></p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p><span>In the programming world, the word “sharing” has <strong>a deeper and more complex meaning</strong> than its daily use among the public. I’ll explain. Let’s assume that I am a chef at a restaurant. Tonight I’m making a wonderful dish of spaghetti Bolognese – my mother’s legendary recipe… I serve the dish to the table, and my guests simply cannot get enough of my spaghetti. You could say that I “shared” the dish with my guests – but that wouldn’t be completely true: I shared the dish, but I didn’t share the recipe. By not telling them how I made the spaghetti – I am preventing them from trying to make it themselves. Only by sharing my secret recipe will I give them something more meaningful than a delicious bowl of pasta; only by sharing the idea of spaghetti Bolognese and my mother’s special way of making it can they hope to recreate my dish, alter it, and create a new, perhaps even more delicious, dish than mine.</span></p>
<p><span>In the programming world, this ‘recipe’ is called the <strong>‘Source Code’</strong>: it is the specific list of instructions that the programmer created for the processor to execute. These instructions are then transformed, via a special process, to a regular software that we, the users, are familiar with. A game, for example, starts out as a long list of instructions. I can share with someone a copy of a game I wrote – just as sharing a dish of pasta – but only when I share the source code will it be considered “full sharing.” A programmer that will get access to my source code could understand the techniques and ideas I used, learn from them, and perhaps create a new and improved version of the game.</span></p>
<p><span>But that, of course, is exactly the reason why business companies <strong>refuse to share</strong> their software’s source code. A program’s source code is often considered to be a top industrial secret and is closely guarded, since what game company would want its competitors to develop an improved version of its game?</span></p>
<h3>A new Operating System</h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Heckert_GNU_white.svg/246px-Heckert_GNU_white.svg.png"></a><figcaption>The GNU Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Stallman knew that the key to creating a community of programmers, all sharing the same passion for technology and the will to contribute to a common cause, is by creating <strong>an environment of full cooperation</strong>, without secrets or restraints: meaning, the programmers needed to share the source code they are writing. In other words, this is exactly the difference between a group of people eating prepared food and having a not-so-interesting-conversation, to a group of chefs standing around the kitchen table, and passionately debating whether rosemary should be added to the dish, or rather oregano. Together they will create a wonderful and unique dish that otherwise would not have existed.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“But I wanted to create once again a community in which people would work together, contributing in the spirit of scientific cooperation, to making software for everyone to use. So I realized the only way we can have such a community is if we were using free software! We had to make sure all the software we were using was, if fact, free – and then we could have such a community. But there wasn’t sufficient free software, so that was my job. I had to bring into existence a free software operating system – but this time one for modern computers instead of 1968 computer design. So, that’s what I started to do. I announced the development of the GNU operating system, and asked the people to join and help.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>An <strong>operating system</strong> is a vital instrument in the process of creating new software; it is the foundation on which a software operates – just the same as roads, signs, and stoplights are the foundation of transportation. The most common and popular operating system at the time was <strong>Unix</strong>, and the majority of programmers were familiar with it. Unix was owned by AT&amp;T, and whoever wanted to use it had to pay the company. Stallman wanted to create an operating system that was similar to Unix – but one that was free, that is – not proprietary. In 1983 he released a statement in one of the online discussion groups and announced his new project: <strong>the GNU project</strong> – an endeavor to create a new, modern, operating system. The acronym GNU stands for: GNU is Not Unix. This is known as “recursive acronym,” because the letter “G” stands for the acronym itself.</span></p>
<p><span>A year later, in 1984, Richard Stallman left MIT in order to concentrate on his project and established an organization called the “Free Software Foundation” (FSF). He wanted to institutionalize the idea of “sharing” which was so common during the 1960s and 70’s and create a social movement with a clear ideology, a movement whose members support and assist each other. Needless to say, the ideology encouraged people to create and share “Free Software”.</span></p>
<h3><span>What is ‘Free Software’?</span></h3>
<p><span>Here’s Stallman’s definition of a ‘free software.’ Remember that programmers count from zero, not from 1…</span></p>
<p><em><span>“There’s a definition of ‘free software.’ A program is Free Software if it gives you, the user, the four essential freedoms. And these are:</span></em></p>
<p><span>It’s important to note that Stallman takes every opportunity to stress the fact that the word “free” in “Free Software” refers to “<strong>freedom</strong>” rather than “<strong>free of charge</strong>.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>“The word free has multiple meanings. When I use it, it means free as in freedom. I am careful that when I mean ‘zero price’ I never say free – I say Gratis because I want it to be clear what I mean.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Why does Stallman emphasize freedom as a main and vital characteristic of a software? In all the years I have been working as a software engineer, I have read countless books and articles about software engineering, all full of advice and techniques for creating a “good” piece of software – but the word freedom was never mentioned in any of them. So what makes it so important, according to Stallman?</span></p>
<h3>The Importance of Free Software</h3>
<p><span>Well, he believes <strong>sharing knowledge and ideas</strong> are the keys to innovation in software. A proprietary software, one where the user has no access to its source code, might be useful – but it contributes nothing to innovation; in fact, it even blocks it.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s assume that I am a programmer and that one day I realize that the software I am using – Microsoft’s Word, for example – could be significantly improved by adding some feature. This feature might be a major one – such as adding support for a new foreign language, or it might be a minor one, like adding a new icon. Since Microsoft won’t give me access to the source code of “Word,” there is no way for me to make those improvements. I could, of course, rewrite a better version of “Word”…<strong>but that’s not really practical</strong>. It would me years of work in order to create the software from scratch when all I wanted to do was add a single feature. This is a common example of how a lack of access to the program’s source code blocks innovation.</span></p>
<h3>A Struggle for Control</h3>
<p><span>The lack of freedom could also be harmful in other, less obvious ways.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“When a person spends a lot of time using a computer system, the configuration of that computer system becomes the city that he lives in. Just as the way our houses and furniture are laid out, determines what it’s like for us to live among them, so does the computer system that we use, and if we can’t change the computer system that we use to suit us, then our lives are really under the control of others. And a person who sees this becomes in a certain way demoralized: “It’s no use trying to change those things, they’re always going to be bad. No point even hassling it. I’ll just put in my time and … when it’s over I’ll go away and try not to think about it anymore”. That kind of spirit, that unenthusiasm is what results from not being permitted to make things better when you have feelings of public spirit.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Stallman views controlling a software as a part of a power struggle between common citizens and the powerful forces of society – <strong>a class struggle</strong> whose terminology is almost identical to older social ideologies like Marxism.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“If the users don’t have all of those freedoms, and they don’t fully control the program – which means it’s the program that controls the users, and the owner controls the program. So that program is an instrument that gives the owner power over the users. That’s why non-free software is an injustice. And this power is a constant temptation to the developers. Nowadays the ethical standards of the developers of proprietary software have gone down through the floor, and it’s standard practice to make non-free software spy on users, intentionally stop them from doing the things they want to do – this is called ‘DRM’, Digital Restrictions management – and there are also backdoors that accept commands from somebody else to do something to the user. And some proprietary software are platforms for censorship.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Stallman’s ideas regarding freedom and cooperation gained a lot of traction, and the <strong>Free Software movement became bigger and stronger.</strong> Its members organized conferences, published online magazines, and created group chats on the internet. Other programmers joined the movement in order to help him with the GNU project; which was more certainly needed since writing an operating system is a complex task that demands thousands of hours. But despite all the volunteering spirit, the cooperation and the help he got, in the early 1990s Stallman found himself facing a serious problem.</span></p>
<h3><span>The Hurd Kernel</span></h3>
<p><span>Roughly speaking, an operating system can be described as having two parts: a “<strong>kernel</strong>,” and an “<strong>envelope</strong>” (also known as “application layer”). The envelope holds the software that computer users work with, for example, a calculator, file explorer, or a drawing software. The kernel of an operating system is the part that connects software to the hardware – the processor, the memory, the disk, and more. If we think of an operating system as a theater play, then the envelope is the stage, and the kernel is the mechanism behind the scenes: the lighting technician, the set manager, make-up artist and all necessary service providers that are needed to run the show.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the kernel is often the most complicated part of the operating system, Stallman, and the Free Software Foundation members decided to write it last. When they were done with the envelope and were finally ready to write the kernel – it turned out that the task was even more complicated than they anticipated. The kernel, named ‘<strong>Hurd</strong>‘, was <strong>too complicated and unstable</strong>, and at a certain point it was clear to everyone that it had no hope of replacing the popular operating system “Unix.”</span></p>
<p><span>The GNU project was <strong>stuck in a technological quicksand</strong> that threatened the entire Free Software movement: although the envelope was ready, there was no kernel – and without an operating system, it is impossible to write free software – and writing free software was the whole point.</span></p>
<h3><span>Linux Joins Project GNU</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/204px-Tux.svg.png"></a><figcaption>The Linux Mascot</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Help came from an unexpected source. In August 1991, a young Finnish student named <strong>Linus Benedict Torvalds</strong>, posted a message on one of the group chats:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Hello, everybody out there using minix [an operating system]–</span></em></p>
<p><span>Despite his modesty, Torvalds’ amateur operating system was a source of interest to many programmers, who helped him improve and expand it. It was later named “<strong>Linux</strong>” – a combination of his name, “Linus” and “Unix.”</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned, Richard Stallman was just looking for a suitable replacement for Hurd, the failing kernel of the GNU project, and found Linux to be very interesting. The Linux operating system was completely new and therefore didn’t contain any code from Unix or other proprietary software – a necessary demand for any free software. At first, Stallman was reluctant about using Linux since Torvalds announced that his operating system could only support a certain type of computer known as AT. This meant that Linux was limited to only one computer model and hence was not completely “free”. But two years later, when <strong>Stallman realized the advantages</strong> of Linux’s technology, he changed his mind and Linux replaced Hurd as the kernel of GNU operating system. Since then, the operating system is called <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> – to denote that the envelope is GNU while the Kernel is Linux.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“You shouldn’t exaggerate that. Basically, we tried to develop lots of programs, and some of them we succeeded, and some of them we didn’t. The important thing is that we did get a free kernel because someone wrote one.”</span></em></p>
<h3>A Trojan Horse</h3>
<p><span>Adding Linux gave the GNU project <strong>a powerful tailwind</strong>. Linux was a very successful kernel, and together with the software developed by Stallman and his colleagues, it created a strong, sophisticated, and reliable operating system that proved the validity of Stallman’s ideas – that full cooperation of knowledge and ideas could produce quality software to compete against proprietary software sold by Microsoft and others. Many new members joined the Free Software movement, and Richard Stallman’s reputation as the prophet of this new and exciting movement was accordingly established.</span></p>
<p><span>But even though Linux was an important addition to the GNU project, it also turned out to be somewhat of a Trojan horse. The significant changes Linux created, or to be more accurate – the changes brought about by the young programmers it attracted – were about to create <strong>a serious rift</strong> within the young community of the Free Software movement. This rift and its consequences will be the focus of our next episode. We will talk about the split that occurred in the Free Software movement which led to the establishment of the open Source movement. We will also answer the question – why is Google trying to kill Android? And we will also get to know Richard Stallman better – what does the guru think of modern software technology? You might be surprised to find out that he hardly ever uses it.</span></p>
<h2><span>Part II</span></h2>
<p><span>In the previous episode, I introduced Richard Stallman, one the greatest hackers in computer history, whose bearded figure became iconic as the character of the Hollywood computer hacker. Stallman is also one of my biggest heroes – he has been an inspiration to me from the moment I realized I wanted to be an engineer.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Richard Stallman is admired by many, he is also considered to be… <strong>not an easy-going person</strong>, to say the least. I had a taste of this myself while trying to schedule a phone interview with him. As early as the first e-mail correspondence between us, Stallman demanded that I specifically note in the interview that Linux is a part of the GNU project (Or, to put it more accurately: GNU uses Linux as part of its software suite) and that I would refer to it by its full name: <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>. If I didn’t agree – no interview. He also demanded that I make a clear distinction between “Free Software” and “Open Source” – a distinction we will get to later on. Again, If I didn’t agree – no interview. Both are legitimate and even important requests, of course – but I got the sense that Stallman is a man who takes his ideas and ideals very very seriously… And lastly – Stallman requested that the episode will be distributed in a copyright-free format such as <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong> and that the podcast’s website will not use any proprietary technology like Javascript. He did agree to compromise on some of the demands when I explained that the website will not work without Javascript.</span></p>
<h3>The Man Who Called Me a Fool</h3>
<p><span>Stallman took upon himself the role of a “<strong>counterweight</strong>” to all users who prefer the comfort offered by proprietary software over the freedom of free software.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Like, there might be somebody who wants to talk to you using Skype. Now, Skype is a proprietary program and we know it’s malware. So if you put it on your computer you’re surrendering your freedom.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>At this point, I was wondering whether I should tell Richard that I’m calling him via skype…</span></p>
<p><em><span>“It’s the act of a fool!”</span></em></p>
<p><span>On second thought, <strong>maybe I shouldn’t</strong>.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“People who really value freedom tell others ‘No!, no I won’t have Skype on my computer, no I won’t use Skype because if I’m using it then someone else is using it because of me, and I’m not going to encourage someone else to surrender freedom by doing that. But, that takes moral courage! It takes moral courage and our society doesn’t promote moral courage.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>A short visit to Stallman’s website gives a general clue about his <strong>militant character</strong>: the website is full of slogans and calls for activism, such as a call to resist oil drilling in the North Pole, a call to boycott Facebook due to its privacy issues, to boycott Apple, Amazon, the patent system, and even boycott Harry Potter since Stallman believes that J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry potter books, is too greedy.</span></p>
<h3><span>An Abomination</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Linus_Torvalds.jpeg/176px-Linus_Torvalds.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Linus Torvalds (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In 1996, Stallman and his colleagues at the Free Software Foundation held a conference. The main speaker was <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>. Interestingly enough, even though Torvalds contributed to the GNU project by letting Stallman use his operating system, he did not share Stallman’s ideas and ideology. Of course, he was thrilled to assist the GNU project –but unlike Stallman, Torvalds was <strong>more interested in the technological aspects</strong> of software engineering and operating systems, rather than the social aspects. On stage, Torvalds gave a speech where he said, among other things, that he loves using Powerpoint, Microsoft’s presentation software.</span></p>
<p><span>For Stallman and his supporters, Torvalds’ words were nothing but <strong>blasphemy</strong>. They considered Powerpoint an abomination: a proprietary software by a company known for its ruthless business ethics. Using PowerPoint?!… Who would do such a thing?!</span></p>
<p><span>Yet the message Torvalds put forth in his speech – intentionally or unintentionally – <strong>hit a sensitive spot</strong> among the younger crowd. At that point, the Free Software Foundation was over a decade old and many of its younger members grew up in a world much different than the world Stallman grew up in. During the 1960s and 70s, when computers were found mostly in academic institutions, free software was the norm while proprietary software was relatively rare. Torvalds’ generation grew up in the 1980s and 90s when having a computer at home wasn’t unheard-of. Proprietary software was all around, while free software was now rare. Of course, everyone believed in freedom and cooperation – but if you like a certain software and think it is useful, why not use it? Only because it is not free?? Many of the younger generation hadn’t “connected” to Stallman’s militant and strict message, and this inter-generational gap led to a crisis within the movement in 1998 – a crisis that ultimately led to a division, and the birth of the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>.</span></p>
<h3>A Surreal Situation</h3>
<p><span>As we all know, Open Source is a much more familiar and household name than Free Software – and we’ll get to the reasons for this, and the actual differences between these two terms in a few minutes. The rise of Open Source <strong>created an odd situation</strong>, perhaps even a bit surreal.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Most people who have heard of me have been misinformed and believe that I’m a supporter of Open Source. I get messages several times a week thanking me for my contributions to Open Source, and I have to write back to them and point out that there is a misunderstanding here. I support the Free Software Movement.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>I should point out that Open is not a movement. The whole point was not to be a movement. You see, we are a movement: we’re fighting for something. Open Source was started by people that didn’t like the idea that there was an injustice to be fought and didn’t want to say that.”</span></em></p>
<h3>Tim O’Reilly</h3>
<p><span>At this point, it’s a good idea to introduce into the conversation one of the men who started Open Source.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Hey, Ran! [Ran: Hi, Tim, what’s up?] It’s good.”</span></em></p>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Tim_O%27Reilly-2009.jpg/193px-Tim_O%27Reilly-2009.jpg"></a><figcaption>Tim O’Reilly (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Although you might not recognize the voice, I’m willing to bet his name will ring a bell – at least for anyone who has been in the Hi-Tech industry for the last thirty years or so. He is <strong>Tim O’Reilly</strong>, founder of O’Reilly Media, which publishes a great many books on technological topics. He also one of the more<strong> influential thinkers</strong> in Silicon Valley, and popularized the terms Web 2.0 and – as we shall soon hear – Open Source itself. I asked Tim about his recollection of the pre-Free Software movement period.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“It’s actually interesting that you start there because there is a narrative that it all started with Richard Stallman and the GNU Manifesto. My first encounter with Free Software predates the GNU Manifesto. I was a tech writing consultant and I started using UNIX. I was really deep in the UNIX culture of free software. It was this big collaborative barn-raising that built UNIX. Even though it was originally developed at AT&amp;T, many of the key utilities were developed outside – particularly at UC Berkeley. I had become immersed in this culture and started documenting, filling in the gaps in the documentation for UNIX. I put together several documentation sets for clients. So, that was my world. It was the world of the shared community of UNIX.</span></em></p>
<h3>The UC Berkeley/Unix Culture</h3>
<p><em><span>“Richard [Stallman] came along and said – ‘Copyright is Evil, so we’ve got this new thing called Copyleft.’ Here at Berkeley we just said – ‘Take our software to Copy Central and make copies of it!’ [laughing] that was the culture that I grow up in, like – hey, we’re doing this thing for research, we’re doing this thing to advance the state of the art and we’re giving it away to all commerce because it’s just this reciprocal gift culture. It was really a continuation, in my mind, of that UC Berkeley/Early UNIX culture, that was really just about advancing the state of the art without having the political overlay that the Free Software Foundation had. But again, for me, I was really influenced by the UNIX/Berkeley side.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>And again, I also think you should realize that the UNIX/Berkeley side is also where most of the proto-internet software was created. The TCP/IP stack, BIND – the program that runs the DNS, Sendmail which did most of the early internet mail routing. They all came out of UC Berkeley and that was part of the world I was living in.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>So in essence, Tim is saying that Free Software – or at least the ideas of free software – didn’t start with the GNU project and that Open Source has much <strong>deeper roots</strong> in the sharing culture of UC Berkeley, back in the UNIX days.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I think Richard played a really important role in formulating a set of ideas, but in a lot of ways, I feel his work was a distraction from what was really happening. The narrative that said it began with the GNU Manifesto misses the fact that it was happening long before that, and if you look at the fruits of the tradition that was outside the scope of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Manifesto, they actually had a bigger impact. All those people who were sitting there, trying to make the Linux desktop win against Microsoft, was this huge distraction for the better part of a decade. And meanwhile, the future was marching on on the back of what came out of Berkeley/Unix. And again, I don’t want to give Berkeley too much credit because obviously a lot of internet software [didn’t originate there]. The TCP/IP stack that ended up getting most widely used came out of Berkeley, but not TCP/IP itself. BIND came out of Berkeley, but not the design for BIND. The DNS was actually designed somewhere else.”</span></em></p>
<h3>Incorrect Interpretation</h3>
<p><span>The popularity of the GNU/Linux operating system clearly demonstrated the positive technical potential of Free Software. Still, there were <strong>many engineers and businessmen that doubted its financial basis:</strong> how can a company survive if it’s giving away its product for free? One of the reasons some businesses refused to adopt Free Software stemmed from an incorrect interpretation of the term “Free” in this context. Some people mistook it to mean the software was distributed free of charge – and what costs nothing, goes the idiom, is worth nothing. Of course, that wasn’t what Richard Stallman meant – he spoke of free as in freedom, not gratis. But some businesspeople didn’t or couldn’t understand the ideological nuances behind the idea of Free Software.</span></p>
<h3><span>Open Source Is Born</span></h3>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Opensource.svg/170px-Opensource.svg.png"></a><figcaption>Open Source Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In February 1998, a few developers and entrepreneurs met in California, in an organization called T<strong>he Foresight institute</strong>. The catalyst for the meeting was a dramatic announcement by the Netscape corporation that had taken place a month earlier. The name “<strong>Netscape</strong>” was familiar to almost anyone who used the web in the 1990s: it was the owner of the Netscape browser, the most popular browser at the time. Netscape’s leaders were familiar with the ideas behind the Free Software Foundation – and believed in them. In an almost unprecedented step, Netscape decided to share the browser’s source code and invited programmers around the world to contribute to it and improve it. Netscape’s announcement stirred a great interest in the technology world; The California conference participants of the Foresight institute wanted to take advantage of Netscape’s announcement and use the media attention to spread the ideas of Free Software. They decided it was their duty to educate the business world about the real advantages of free software: to emphasize the technical advantages of an open development model over a closed one. To do so – they had to detach themselves from Richard Stallman and his ideological burden.</span></p>
<p><span>This wasn’t an easy decision; Richard Stallman was a living legend, a figure larger than life. He was the face and the heart of the Free Software Foundation, devoting his life to the Free Software movement and to the ideals they all believed in. But the conference participants felt that the philosophical discussion about freedom, control, and class struggle was hurting their cause. They wanted to focus on the practical benefits of Free Software, such as the increase in innovation – but they all knew Stallman, and all knew he <strong>would never agree</strong> to that approach. So they finally decided to quit Stallman’s Free Software Foundation, and establish a new one called “Open Source Initiative.” The name “open source” was chosen specifically in order to avoid connotations related to “free.”</span></p>
<h3>The Open Source Summit</h3>
<p><span>This is where Tim O’Reilly entered the scene. In 1998 he organized a conference of some of the <strong>best and brightest minds</strong> in the software world: Linus Torvalds, Guido Van Rossum (the creator of Python), Larry Wall (of Perl) and many other luminaries.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I’ve been thinking about it all through the Fall that I wanted to bring all these people together. I realized that I knew all these people – they didn’t know each other. I would go to the IETF meetings – the Internet Engineering Task Force – and see Paul Vixie there (the guy who wrote BIND) or Eric Allman who wrote Sendmail, but none of the GNU people – they didn’t even know about the IETF as far as I could tell. I was kind of thinking – I want to bridge these two communities, the internet community, and the Linux community.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>This conference is known today as the<strong> Open Source Summit</strong>, but it wasn’t called that in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“And so I scheduled this event, what I called at the time ‘The Freeware Summit’. In the meantime, what I believe was six weeks before, Christine Peterson of the Foresight Institute which was really a nanotechnology think tank, proposed the term Open Source. I didn’t know about that when I invited people. “</span></em></p>
<h3>Getting the Media Onboard</h3>
<p><em><span>“I built a lot of relations with the press then, and I also got this idea that telling a big story was the right way to advance the agenda. So in addition to bringing all these people together for this Freeware Summit, my goal right from the outset was: we’re going to tell a story about all these people who have this thing in common.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>But it was not actually until during the day at that meeting that I heard the term Open Source. We were talking about the naming issues, and Eric told about the invention of this term, Open Source, and actually there was quite a bit of push back! It sounds like ‘open sores’, it will never fly…but I said – look, we really want to have a common story, so let’s take a vote and let’s all agree that this is the term. So, everybody who was there, we took a vote and Open Source won. So we had a press conference at the end of the day and we introduced the term.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>The way the press conference was set up was, I just had all these people behind a long table, and we had people from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, San Jose Mercury which at the time was the paper record of Silicon Valley, Forbes, and Fortune. And I said, look – all these guys have an absolute market share in the category of software with no marketing budget, no company behind them, just on the strength of their ideas of this new development model and this model of giving away the software for free over the internet. It’s called Open Source.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>I said look – you guys have been told that the Free Software is that rebel movement that’s hostile to commercial software. I’m here to tell a very different story, and that is that you are all already using Free Software, you just don’t know it. I went down a list: if you have a domain name, nytime.com or fortune.com, you’re using a software written by this long haired guy over here, and the entire internet depends on that piece of free software. Oh, and if you send email, Eric Allman here wrote the program Sendmail that routes 75% of all the internet’s email. 75% of all websites are actually running on Apache, which was started by this long haired guy here, and co-founded by this long haired guy here.”</span></em></p>
<h3>A Great Success</h3>
<p><span>Tim’s initiative was a great success. The fact that so many opinion leaders and experts sponsored the Open Source initiative helped <strong>push it forward</strong>, and within a few years it eclipsed its big sister, Free Software.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I had no role in the coining of the term ‘Open Source’. I think what I did that was really meaningful and turned out to be profoundly right, is that I said – you know, I don’t think this licensing frame really matters. And in fact, that is why I kinda got demonized by the Free Software Foundation, because I was saying they didn’t matter.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>It’s hard to imagine our current technology world without GNU/Linux, WordPress, Android, PHP and many other software projects that are distributed with their source code. There are <strong>thousands of communities</strong>, large and small, devoted to software tools of almost every sort imaginable: from word processing to espionage software. Some projects last for many years – Linux is a great example – and some are a result of a weekend hackathons, fueled by pizza and soda.</span></p>

<h3><span>What Draws Companies to Open Source?</span></h3>
<figure><a href="http://yougottalovefrontend.com/images/organizers/Yonti.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jonathan Israel of Wix</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>At this point I think we should take a slight digression, you might say, and ask ourselves what draws big tech companies to open source their software – that is, to give it away for free? To help with this question I sat down recently with <strong>Jonathan Israel</strong> of <strong>Wix.com</strong> – a company that specializes in providing easy to use web building tools.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“My name is Jonathan Israel, I work for the Wix Academy for about a year: it is the department which is primarily in charge of recruiting and training junior engineers for the Wix R&amp;D. We’ve also expanded into establishing and maintaining the dev-centric culture that we have at Wix R&amp;D.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Wix, says Jonathan, not only allows its developers to release code they worked on as Open Source – it wants them to do so:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“We promote open source projects, we organize conferences, we allow the people time to write blog posts and help them with resources such as tech writers. We’re pushing forward a lot of standards in open source project, as in your code needs to be documented, it needs to be clear, and we allow engineers that actually develop tools to help with their day-to-day work – to open source them, to allow the people to use the same tools, to learn from the mistakes that we had as a really big development group.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>R: Which brings me to an interesting question. I can understand why you, as developers, have an incentive to release what you worked on as open source. But what incentive does Wix as a company have for open sourcing code which its own developers worked hard for?</span></em></p>
<h3>Knowledge and Branding</h3>
<p><em><span>J: There are two main reasons for that. The first one I already said and will say again. […] it’s the idea that they are first and foremost part of the engineering community. And so, they have a lot of incentive to open source what they are doing and we don’t think that’s a bad idea. On the contrary – you show people that the engineers who work here are engineers like any other place, and we don’t mind. It’s a good idea to show that we support the idea of open source, we support the idea of blog posting, we support the idea [of] sharing the knowledge.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Secondly, and this is a problem that a lot of huge companies used to face, is the problem that looking at Wix.com, which is a platform that allows you build a website without touching a piece of code, ever, it kinda looks trivial. That’s the brand as well: the idea is – ‘anyone can do it’. By going to Wix.com you would realize that this is mostly a software company. Roughly 40% of the company are R&amp;D, and that’s a huge chunk [of the company], there’s no other department that is as big. By encouraging and helping our developers to show their work – if it’s open source project, blog posts, going on stage in conferences and a million other things – that helps Wix show that the engineers who work here are top notch. They are looking at the cutting edge technologies that we can use, they are very experienced. It’s not your boring, ordinary, software engineering. It’s the main thing that we do. “</span></em></p>
<p><span>In other words, companies like Wix view the idea of sharing software not as a liability – but as an opportunity. By releasing software as Open Source, they encourage their developers to learn new things, be part of a greater community and feel more satisfied. In the process, these companies also brand themselves as leaders and positive forces of innovation in the world of technology. It’s a win-win situation that helped the open source community explode over the last few years.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why is Google Killing Android</span></h3>
<p><span>I admit that it was hard for me at first to understand why Stallman denies the Open Source Initiative – an initiative that exists mainly due to his early efforts. But looking closely at Stallman’s motives, I could begin to grasp the <strong>roots of his resentment</strong>. It is easy to let Stallman off the hook by saying that he is a rigid conservative ideologist who wouldn’t put his pride aside and admit that someone else marketed his ideas better than him. But is that really the case here? I am not so sure. Here is an example that might make you think twice about the way our modern technology world operates. It has to do with the Android operating system. As I said, it will make you think TWICE, since in fact there are two Android operating systems.</span></p>
<figure><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Android_robot_2014.svg/204px-Android_robot_2014.svg.png"></a><figcaption>Android Logo (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In the late 2000’s, Apple set the tone in the smartphones’ market. When you said “smartphone”, you meant Apple’s iPhone. <strong>Google saw Apple’s success as a threat</strong> and wanted to gain at least some of the smartphone market share in order to sustain its control of search and other online services. Therefore, in 2006, Google initiated the <strong>Android Open Source Project, or ASOP</strong> for short – an operating system for smartphones developed by “Android Ltd,” which was bought by Google. A resourceful community grew around Android, with many developers who created new apps and modifications for the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>A quick jump to the present. <strong>The tables have turned:</strong> Android has the lion’s share of the smartphone market and is making Google a lot of money. However, its Open Source status has now become a disadvantage for Google. Since Android’s code is available to the public, nothing prevents a competitor from taking the code, modifying it a bit and then using it in its own smartphones or tablets. In fact, that is exactly was Amazon did! Amazon took Android, adapted it to its own tablets and created a competitive app store to Google’s Play Store.</span></p>
<h3>App Rot</h3>
<p><span>You don’t have to have a degree in business management in order to see that Google has <strong>no interest in providing other companies a with a “gift”</strong> like a ready-to-use operating system. But on the other hand, it’s also not in Google’s best interest to upset its developers’ community, the people who worked hard on Android all these years – so turning Android into a proprietary software was also out of the question. Google’s solution, then, was to slowly but surely “strangle” the Android Open Source Project.</span></p>
<p><span>How? When users turn on their Android device for the first time, they find all sorts of basic and standard apps already installed on their smartphone: a Calendar, keyboard, camera, music player, and more. These apps are a part of the Android Open Source Project, and every phone maker who wants to use Android gets them for free as a part of the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>At the beginning, Google updated these apps on a regular basis – but over the last few years, Google stopped updating the open source apps. Instead, it released new, proprietary apps, substitutes for the old ones. The SMS application, for example, was replaced by Hangouts. The music app was replaced by Google Play Music, and the same goes for the calendar app, the camera app, the search app, the keyboard and more. The new apps are being updated frequently while <strong>the old ones slowly rot away, neglected</strong>. For example, the proprietary version of the search app has a voice recognition ability, and can read search results out loud. The open source version for the same app supports text search and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span>Now let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a cell phone manufacturer, Samsung for example. Android is an open source software, so Samsung could use it “as is” – it doesn’t need Google’s permission. But what Samsung will get is an inferior operating system with some aging apps. If it wishes to have the newer, proprietary apps – it needs to strike a deal with Google and pay whatever needs to be paid. The final outcome is that Samsung and almost all other smartphone makers are <strong>tied to Google in “golden chains”</strong> and cannot compete with it. And if there is no competition – the customer is almost always on the losing side.</span></p>
<h3>Bussiness and Ethics</h3>
<p><span>Honestly, I don’t blame Google. If I were in Sergey’s Brin shoes – I’d probably make the same business decisions, and that’s <strong>exactly what Stallman is saying.</strong> In his view, companies like Google adopt the Open Source policy for the financial benefit it offers. But as soon as that benefit disappears, they happily abandoned it. Had Google, for example, adopted the Free Software ideology of maintaining the user’s’ freedom, encouraging innovation, and so on – it might not have backed down from it so easily.</span></p>
<p><span>Tim O’Reilly, however, <strong>completely disagrees</strong> with this assumption.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I think they are completely orthogonal. The morality of a company is not encoded by a license that compels them to morality. If we are compelled to morality – it’s actually a much shallower morality than one that seems us all as members of the same species, all members of the same body. If you think that way, you will act morally.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>“I think Open Source is the way of life, just like gravity is the way of life. There are certain dynamics that actually work, and the quest of Open Source should figure out what works in terms of creating the most value for society, for individuals or companies. I always saw Open Source as a scientific pursuit and felt the Free Software Foundation treated it almost as if it’s a religious pursuit. It was certainly a moral pursuit. And the thing that always bothered me are the critics who always said – well, Open Source doesn’t have a moral backing. That’s like the political conservatives saying that the liberals don’t have a moral backing. You’ve got to be kidding! These are just different moral backing. One is the stern, punishing father moral backing, and the other is the nurturing mother. The idealism of a Tim Berners-Lee or Larry Wall, who gave their software free to the world: are you telling me that that is not a moral act? And that it’s more moral to say “we’re gonna put out this software with a bunch of restrictions to make sure that nobody does something that we don’t approve of. I’m just on the more liberal side.”</span></em></p>
<h3><span>A Dark Prophecy</span></h3>
<p><span>Richard Stallman still leads the Free Software Foundation as its president and continues to <strong>warn against the dangers</strong> of proprietary technology.</span></p>
<p><em><span>“I’m afraid that we would someday need free hardware designs and then to fabricate them to have computers that permit us to run free software. Look at the “iThings”, those monsters from Apple. They are designed to make it hard to install any different software. Apple is trying to have total control on what software people can run. In fact, the only way people can install software that Apple didn’t approve is to ‘Jailbreak’ the machine. Think about that term – jailbreak. These people, these users of iThings are saying that the iThing is a jail for its user, and they are exactly right. And Window’s phones and tablets do the same thing. This practice is spreading. I hope it won’t be true, but it may be true in some years that only free hardware designs will make it possible for us to use free software.”</span></em></p>
<p><span>This is <strong>a dark prophecy</strong>. I didn’t want our interview to end on such a negative tone, so I asked Stallman which gadgets he uses. You know… as one geek to another… after all, Stallman is a hacker, THE hacker. Well… I wasn’t ready for this one:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“[Ran: I guess that you like Technology, right? I mean, on a personal level…]</span></em></p>
<h3>Making the Right Choice</h3>
<p><span>I must admit that Stallman made me think. I have always been a sworn fan of any kind of technology and was the first to buy every new gadget and cool app. I never gave a second thought about my freedom of choice, the right of innovation, or other issues Stallman cares about so dearly. <strong>I’ll probably be more aware</strong> of these matters in the future, and they may affect my purchasing decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>But how far will I go with my inner truth? Richard Stallman, as he was during the 1970s and 80s, was an inspiration. A mythological hacker. A man who breathed ate and slept technology twenty-four-seven. But Richard Stallman of 2016 doesn’t own a smartphone or tablet and doesn’t listen to MP3 music files. Stallman seems to be afraid of technology. For me, it’s like hearing <strong>Superman</strong> confess that he’s afraid of heights.</span></p>
<p><span>This may sound like an impossible choice to make: should I give up my love for technology, or should I give up my freedom? I fear that if Stallman is right, a day might come when I will actually have to choose. I fear the day when I will find out that I am <strong>not brave enough</strong> to make the right choice.</span></p>

Despite dramatic, recent increases in accuracy, three challenges remain: (i) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for which an MSA cannot be generated, (ii) rapid exploration of designed structures, and (iii) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent geometric network (RGN) able to predict protein structure from single protein sequences without use of MSAs. This deep learning system has two novel elements: a protein language model (AminoBERT) that uses a Transformer to learn latent structural information from millions of unaligned proteins and a geometric module that compactly represents C<sub>α</sub> backbone geometry. RGN2 outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (as well as trRosetta) on orphan proteins and is competitive with designed sequences, while achieving up to a 10<sup>6</sup>-fold reduction in compute time. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical strengths of protein language models relative to MSAs in structure prediction.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-4">M.A. is a member of the SAB of FL2021-002, a Foresite Labs company, and consults for Interline Therapeutics.

<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_1.png"></a></p><div><p>Ulam spiral of size 200×200. Black dots represent prime numbers. Diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines with a high density of prime numbers are clearly visible.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Randomly_black_odd_numbers.png"></a></p><div><p>For comparison, a spiral with random odd numbers colored black (at the same density of primes in a 200x200 spiral).</p></div></div></div>
<p>The <b>Ulam spiral</b> or <b>prime spiral</b> is a graphical depiction of the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" title="Prime number">prime numbers</a>, devised by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Ulam" title="Stanisław Ulam">Stanisław Ulam</a> in 1963 and popularized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner" title="Martin Gardner">Martin Gardner&#39;s</a> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics" title="Recreational mathematics">Mathematical Games</a></i> column in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i> a short time later.  It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.
</p><p>Ulam and Gardner emphasized the striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes. Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function" title="Quadratic function">quadratic polynomials</a>, and certain such polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler" title="Euler">Euler</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Prime_formulas_and_polynomial_functions" title="Formula for primes">prime-generating polynomial</a> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers.  Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with major unsolved problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%27s_problems" title="Landau&#39;s problems">Landau&#39;s problems</a>.  In particular, no quadratic polynomial has ever been proved to generate infinitely many primes, much less to have a high asymptotic density of them, although there is a well-supported <a href="#Hardy_and_Littlewood&#39;s_Conjecture_F">conjecture</a> as to what that asymptotic density should be.
</p><p>In 1932, more than thirty years prior to Ulam&#39;s discovery, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetologist" title="Herpetologist">herpetologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Monroe_Klauber" title="Laurence Monroe Klauber">Laurence Klauber</a> constructed a triangular, non-spiral array containing vertical and diagonal lines exhibiting a similar concentration of prime numbers.  Like Ulam, Klauber noted the connection with prime-generating polynomials, such as Euler&#39;s.

<p>The Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral" title="Spiral">spiral</a> arrangement on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_lattice" title="Square lattice">square lattice</a>:
</p>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_spiral_howto_all_numbers.svg" title="Numbers from 1 to 49 placed in spiral order"></a></p></div>
<p>and then marking the prime numbers:
</p>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_spiral_howto_primes_only.svg" title="Small Ulam spiral"></a></p></div>
<p>In the figure, primes appear to concentrate along certain diagonal lines.  In the 200×200 Ulam spiral shown above, diagonal lines are clearly visible, confirming that the pattern continues. Horizontal and vertical lines with a high density of primes, while less prominent, are also evident.  Most often, the number spiral is started with the number 1 at the center, but it is possible to start with any number, and the same concentration of primes along diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines is observed. Starting with 41 at the center gives a diagonal containing an unbroken string of 40 primes (starting from 1523 southwest of the origin, decreasing to 41 at the origin, and increasing to 1601 northeast of the origin), the longest example of its kind.
</p>
<h2><span id="History">History</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ulam_spiral&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: History">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>According to Gardner, Ulam discovered the spiral in 1963 while doodling during the presentation of &#34;a long and very boring paper&#34; at a scientific meeting.  These hand calculations amounted to &#34;a few hundred points&#34;.  Shortly afterwards, Ulam, with collaborators Myron Stein and Mark Wells, used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_II" title="MANIAC II">MANIAC II</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory</a> to extend the calculation to about 100,000 points.  The group also computed the density of primes among numbers up to 10,000,000 along some of the prime-rich lines as well as along some of the prime-poor lines.  Images of the spiral up to 65,000 points were displayed on &#34;a scope attached to the machine&#34; and then photographed.  The Ulam spiral was described in Martin Gardner&#39;s March 1964 <i>Mathematical Games</i> column in <i>Scientific American</i>  and featured on the front cover of that issue.  Some of the photographs of Stein, Ulam, and Wells were reproduced in the column.
</p><p>In an addendum to the <i>Scientific American</i> column, Gardner mentioned the earlier paper of Klauber.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
Klauber describes his construction as follows, &#34;The integers are arranged in triangular order with 1 at the apex, the second line containing numbers 2 to 4, the third 5 to 9, and so forth.  When the primes have been indicated, it is found that there are concentrations in certain vertical and diagonal lines, and amongst these the so-called Euler sequences with high concentrations of primes are discovered.&#34;

<h2><span id="Explanation">Explanation</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ulam_spiral&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Explanation">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>Diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines in the number spiral correspond to polynomials of the form
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are integer constants.  When <i>b</i> is even, the lines are diagonal, and either all numbers are odd, or all are even, depending on the value of <i>c</i>.  It is therefore no surprise that all primes other than 2 lie in alternate diagonals of the Ulam spiral.  Some  polynomials, such as <span></span>, while producing only odd values, factorize over the integers <span></span> and are therefore never prime except possibly when one of the factors equals 1. Such examples correspond to diagonals that are devoid of primes or nearly so.
</p><p>To gain insight into why some of the remaining odd diagonals may have a higher concentration of primes than others, consider <span></span> and <span></span>. Compute remainders upon division by 3 as <i>n</i> takes successive values 0, 1, 2, ....  For the first of these polynomials, the sequence of remainders is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ..., while for the second, it is 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, .... This implies that in the sequence of values taken by the second polynomial, two out of every three are divisible by 3, and hence certainly not prime, while in the sequence of values taken by the first polynomial, none are divisible by 3. Thus it seems plausible that the first polynomial will produce values with a higher density of primes than will the second. At the very least, this observation gives little reason to believe that the corresponding diagonals will be equally dense with primes. One should, of course, consider divisibility by primes other than 3. Examining divisibility by 5 as well, remainders upon division by 15 repeat with pattern 1, 11, 14, 10, 14, 11, 1, 14, 5, 4, 11, 11, 4, 5, 14 for the first polynomial, and with pattern 5, 0, 3, 14, 3, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 9, 3 for the second, implying that only three out of 15 values in the second sequence are potentially prime (being divisible by neither 3 nor 5), while 12 out of 15 values in the first sequence are potentially prime (since only three are divisible by 5 and none are divisible by 3).
</p><p>While rigorously-proved results about primes in quadratic sequences are scarce, considerations like those above give rise to a plausible conjecture on the asymptotic density of primes in such sequences, which is described in the next section.

<p>In their 1923 paper on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture" title="Goldbach&#39;s conjecture">Goldbach Conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">Hardy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood" title="John Edensor Littlewood">Littlewood</a> stated a series of conjectures, one of which, if true, would explain some of the striking features of the Ulam spiral. This conjecture, which Hardy and Littlewood called &#34;Conjecture F&#34;, is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture" title="Bateman–Horn conjecture">Bateman–Horn conjecture</a> and asserts an asymptotic formula for the number of primes of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>. Rays emanating from the central region of the Ulam spiral making angles of 45° with the horizontal and vertical correspond to numbers of the form 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> with <i>b</i> even; horizontal and vertical rays correspond to numbers of the same form with <i>b</i> odd. Conjecture F provides a formula that can be used to estimate the density of primes along such rays. It implies that there will be considerable variability in the density along different rays. In particular, the density is highly sensitive to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant" title="Discriminant">discriminant</a> of the polynomial, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> − 16<i>c</i>.
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ulam_2.png"></a></p><div><p>The primes of the form 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 2<i>x</i> + 41 with <i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, ... have been highlighted in purple. The prominent parallel line in the lower half of the figure corresponds to 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>x</i> + 41 or, equivalently, to negative values of <i>x</i>.</p></div></div></div>
<p>Conjecture F is concerned with polynomials of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are integers and <i>a</i> is positive. If the coefficients contain a common factor greater than 1 or if the discriminant Δ = <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> − 4<i>ac</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" title="Square number">perfect square</a>, the polynomial factorizes and therefore produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_numbers" title="Composite numbers">composite numbers</a> as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... (except possibly for one or two values of <i>x</i> where one of the factors equals 1). Moreover, if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are both even, the polynomial produces only even values, and is therefore composite except possibly for the value 2. Hardy and Littlewood assert that, apart from these situations, <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> takes prime values infinitely often as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This statement is a special case of an earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture" title="Bunyakovsky conjecture">conjecture of Bunyakovsky</a> and remains open. Hardy and Littlewood further assert that, asymptotically, the number <i>P</i>(<i>n</i>) of primes of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> and less than <i>n</i> is given by
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>A</i> depends on <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> but not on <i>n</i>. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" title="Prime number theorem">prime number theorem</a>, this formula with <i>A</i> set equal to one is the asymptotic number of primes less than <i>n</i> expected in a random set of numbers having the same density as the set of numbers of the form <i>ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i>. But since <i>A</i> can take values bigger or smaller than 1, some polynomials, according to the conjecture, will be especially rich in primes, and others especially poor. An unusually rich polynomial is 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 2<i>x</i> + 41 which forms a visible line in the Ulam spiral. The constant <i>A</i> for this polynomial is approximately 6.6, meaning that the numbers it generates are almost seven times as likely to be prime as random numbers of comparable size, according to the conjecture. This particular polynomial is related to Euler&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Prime_formulas_and_polynomial_functions" title="Formula for primes">prime-generating polynomial</a> <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41 by replacing <i>x</i> with 2<i>x</i>, or equivalently, by restricting <i>x</i> to the even numbers. The constant <i>A</i> is given by a product running over all prime numbers,
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span>,</dd></dl>
<p>in which <span></span> is number of zeros of the quadratic polynomial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" title="Modular arithmetic">modulo</a> <i>p</i> and therefore takes one of the values 0, 1, or 2.  Hardy and Littlewood break the product into three factors as

<dl><dd><span></span>.</dd></dl>
<p>Here the factor ε, corresponding to the prime 2, is 1 if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is odd and 2 if <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> is even. The first product index <i>p</i> runs over the finitely-many odd primes dividing both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.  For these primes <span></span> since  <i>p</i> then cannot divide <i>c</i>. The second product index <span></span> runs over the infinitely-many odd primes not dividing <i>a</i>. For these primes <span></span> equals 1, 2, or 0 depending on whether the discriminant is 0, a non-zero square, or a non-square modulo <i>p</i>. This is accounted for by the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol" title="Legendre symbol">Legendre symbol</a>, <span></span>.  When a prime <i>p</i> divides <i>a</i> but not <i>b</i> there is one root modulo <i>p</i>.  Consequently, such primes do not contribute to the product.

<p>Klauber&#39;s 1932 paper describes a triangle in which row <i>n</i> contains the numbers (<i>n</i>  −  1)<sup>2</sup> + 1 through <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>. As in the Ulam spiral, quadratic polynomials generate numbers that lie in straight lines. Vertical lines correspond to numbers of the form <i>k</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>k</i> + <i>M</i>. Vertical and diagonal lines with a high density of prime numbers are evident in the figure.
</p><p>Robert Sacks devised a variant of the Ulam spiral in 1994. In the Sacks spiral, the non-negative integers are plotted on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral" title="Archimedean spiral">Archimedean spiral</a> rather than the square spiral used by Ulam, and are spaced so that one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" title="Square number">perfect square</a> occurs in each full rotation. (In the Ulam spiral, two squares occur in each rotation.) Euler&#39;s prime-generating polynomial, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>x</i> + 41, now appears as a single curve as <i>x</i> takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This curve asymptotically approaches a horizontal line in the left half of the figure. (In the Ulam spiral, Euler&#39;s polynomial forms two diagonal lines, one in the top half of the figure, corresponding to even values of <i>x</i> in the sequence, the other in the bottom half of the figure corresponding to odd values of <i>x</i> in the sequence.)
</p><p>Additional structure may be seen when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number" title="Composite number">composite numbers</a> are also included in the Ulam spiral. The number 1 has only a single factor, itself; each prime number has two factors, itself and 1; composite numbers are divisible by at least three different factors. Using the size of the dot representing an integer to indicate the number of factors and coloring prime numbers red and composite numbers blue produces the figure shown.
</p><p>Spirals following other tilings of the plane also generate lines rich in prime numbers, for example hexagonal spirals.

    <h2>Surveys show Americans want more walkable cities and bike riding continues to grow. Yet urban streets are still designed and used like highways. Change is happening, but at a very slow pace, says urban expert Jeff Speck.</h2>

      <title>Apple’s new abuse prevention system: an antritust/competition point of view</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___blog_quintarelli_it_2021_08_apples-child-new-abuse-prevention-system-an-antritustcompetition-point-of-view_html/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div itemprop="articleBody">

			
				
				<p>Apple has announced the new client-side content scanning (based on parameters received from the center) to find child sexual abuse materials to be reported to law enforcers.</p>
<p>As per Apple’s announcement, that will happen when uploading those content to iCloud (Apple’s cloud) and it will be opt-in when usage is limited to the device (i.e. not when uploading to iCloud, but for example when sending a message with those contents).</p>
<p>I want to stress that this is <span>Apple’s current announcement</span>. Is it going to be forever so ? Quite unlikely: if the purpose is to analyze content stored on iCloud, given it’s not encrypted, it would be much easier to analyze it once it’s uploaded to the servers, as it is the case with Dropbox, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>The fact that, for non-cloud content, the feature is opt-in, implies that</p>
<ul>
<li>criminals will not opt-in (and not use cloud services) and</li>
<li>not criminals are not exposed to such content anyway (have you received such material recently ??).</li>
</ul>
<p>Children’s safety groups praised Apple’s moves, arguing that they strike a necessary balance which “brings us a step closer to justice for survivors whose most traumatic moments are disseminated online”.</p>
<p>As abominable as these materials can be, do we  really believe that opt-in client-side scanning will do something to eradicate those behaviors ? Do we thing criminals will opt in ? Do we really believe that client side scanning of content uploaded to iCloud will eradicate them ? Do we think criminals use iCloud for their trades ?</p>
<p>I want to stress again that this is the <span>current</span> announced feature. It is easily forseeable that over time pressure by law enforcers will increase to move <span>past the opt-in regime and thus not only for iCloud</span>. What else would be the point of having client side scanning just for iCloud if you could do it centrally as all other providers do ? Quite obviously, client side scanning is for client side scanning. And once there’s that feature, requests to use it will increase.</p>
<p><span>Having started  right away with general client side scanning would  likely not have been  acceptable by the user and by legal communities. But starting just for iCloud, just for the most abominable of all possible crimes, makes client side scanning more acceptable</span>. And those who oppose it appear to be conniving with criminals. This is the same argument we have heard time and again for the compression of privacy rights in favor of a supposed increase of security. But this equation (less privacy = more security) is only apparently founded. Less privacy equals more data, more data does not equal more information and more information does not equal more security. (remember intel agencies knew the menace of 9.11 attacks ? And many others… (almost all, in Europe)).</p>
<p>Do we really think criminals trade CSAM in plain-sight web sites ? Or via ordinary messages ? Or store them on public cloud servers run by major corporations ?…</p>
<p>But the idea is very attractive to law enforcers, tomorrow’s possibility to dig into users’ content without having to complicate their lives installing trojans. It’s the dream of a backdoor available to law enforcement. But when a backdoor is installed, the backdoor exists and history teaches that it’s only a matter of time before it’s also used by the bad guys and authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The above issues have also been raised by other important commentators and better than I have done. But there’s one more angle I want to add: <span><strong>Why is Apple doing it</strong></span>, given their previous stances on privacy safeguards, <span><strong>and why are they doing it now ?</strong></span>.</p>
<p>First of all, please do this (really) easy exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>right click on the cat below and save the file to your computer.</li>
<li>then go to <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide">this link </a>, hit ‘browse’ and select the file you just saved; move the “hidden bits” gauge to 3 and see the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ain’t magic, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">very simple, five centuries old mathematics</a>. You could even encrypt it with a password to obtain the payload and it may be impossible to tell, if you don’t know the little secret.</p>
<p>Do we really  think criminals don’t know mathematics or programming ?</p>
<p><strong>Client side scanning can do little to stop criminals, unless you have a full control of what apps users can install on their devices</strong>. (and how they can use them).</p>
<p>But this is precisely the case of some antitrust actions that are now being brought forward against Apple on the basis that they purportedly excise a monopolistic power on the platform, by their tight control of the App Store where they are the gatekeepers who decide which apps can or can’t be installed by users on their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Apple could have introduced client-side scanning anytime in the past, but now, thanks to this move, Apple will be able to tell the supreme court and the FTC narratives like…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have just released this beautiful tool, that will help law enforcers combat these abominable crimes, but only if they can tightly control apps installed by users</li>
<li>If you’re siding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_neutrality">device neutrality</a> you’re siding with the criminals</li>
<li>Fewer competition is a price  worth paying to protect children</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, in order to have an effective (?) law enforcement, the only possibility is that hardware and software manufacturing companies exercise a total control on the software users can use, de facto becoming states’ digital-law-enforcement  agencies.</p>
<p>If this isn’t a total dystopia, I don’t know what dystopia is…</p>

  <p>Archaeologists in northwestern Saudi Arabia have unearthed a massive collection of bones likely stockpiled by <a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/striped-hyena">striped hyenas</a> over the past 7,000 years.</p>




  

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    
  

  <p>Found in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238113869_UMM_JIRSAN_ARABIA&#39;S_LONGEST_LAVA-TUBE_SYSTEM">Umm Jirsan</a> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/nature/lava-tubes.htm">lava tube</a> system—a sprawling network of tunnels formed by volcanic activity—the <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417892665937612805">hundreds of thousands</a> of bones belong to at least 14 kinds of animals, including cattle, caprids, horses, camels, rodents and even humans. The researchers’ findings are newly published in the journal <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-021-01365-6">Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences</a></em><em>.</em></p>




  

  <p>Lead author <a href="https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/109668/25522">Mathew Stewart</a>, a zooarchaeologist at the <a href="https://www.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History</a> in Germany, tells <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/hyenas-left-a-massive-pile-of-bones-in-a-saudi-arabian-1847370667">Gizmodo</a></em>’s Isaac Schultz that the team identified hyenas as the culprits after analyzing cuts, bites and digestion marks found on the bones.</p>




  

  <p>“Striped hyena are very avid accumulators of bones,” Stewart says.</p>




  

  <p>Researchers have been investigating the site, which is located in the country’s <a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=231060">Harrat Khaybar lava field</a>, since 2007. But they only ventured into the cavern’s depths a few months ago. (Per <em>Gizmodo</em>, another group of archaeologists reported hearing possible hyena <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238113869_UMM_JIRSAN_ARABIA&#39;S_LONGEST_LAVA-TUBE_SYSTEM">snarls</a> in the tubes, prompting them to keep their distance.)</p>

  <p>For the study, the team analyzed 1,917 bones and teeth recovered from the lava tube. <a href="https://www.radiocarbon.com/about-carbon-dating.htm">Radiocarbon dating</a> of a small number of these samples found that they ranged in age from around 439 to 6,839 years old, suggesting “a long use of the lava tube system by carnivores,” per the paper.</p>




  

  <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417894029195350020">Twitter thread</a> quoted by<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2021/08/01/Scientists-discover-hundreds-of-thousands-of-animal-human-bones-in-Saudi-Arabia-cave"> <em>Al Arabiya English</em></a>’s Joanne Serrieh, Stewart notes that hyenas transport bones “to dens to be consumed, fed to young or cached.” The study adds that the carnivores engage in both hunting and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/">scavenging</a> activities, killing some animals while simply hoarding the remains of others.</p>




  

  <p>A key sign that hyenas were responsible for the huge pile of bones was the presence of human skull fragments. The mammals are notorious for rummaging through graves for grub.</p>




  

  <p>“It’s always just the skullcap that survives,” Stewart tells <em>Gizmodo</em>. “[Hyenas] seem to not really be interested in skull caps. We found maybe five or six skullcaps with gnaw marks on them at the site, but only the skullcaps. Nothing else.”</p>




  

  <p>Lone hyenas <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/">typically snack</a> on dead animals. But packs prefer to hunt, targeting prey like antelopes, hares, rodents and birds.</p>



  

  <center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy to introduce the Umm Jirsan lava tube, Saudi Arabia, in our new paper just out in AAS. </p>— Stewie Stewart (@StewieStewart13) <a href="https://twitter.com/StewieStewart13/status/1417892665937612805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></blockquote> </center>



  

  <p>Umm Jirsan is far from the only example of hyenas stockpiling huge assemblages of bones. As Riley Black wrote for <em><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-horse-hunting-hyenas-of-srbsko-chlum-komin-cave">National Geographic</a> </em>in 2010, the Srbsko Chlum-Komin Cave in the Czech Republic contains more than 3,500 well-preserved large mammal bones collected by the carnivores.</p>




  

  <p>The new study took place as part of the <a href="https://www.palaeodeserts.com/" target="_blank">Palaeodeserts Project</a>, which seeks to track human and animal migration across the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia’s harsh weather makes this task difficult: Hot conditions can make bones break down, and some ancient remains actually disintegrate when touched.</p>




  

  <p>“The most surprising thing comes down to just how well preserved the material is, and how much material there is, given that in Saudi we have no faunal remains, really,” Stewart tells <em>Gizmodo</em>.</p>




  

  <p>In the Twitter thread, Stewart lauds the lava tube’s “excellent conditions for preservation of bone.”</p>




  

  <p>He adds, “Umm Jirsan (and other similar sites in the region) is likely to hold valuable insights into the ecologies and environments of Holocene Arabia. This study is just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

      <title>Apply conversion functions to data in SQLite columns with the SQLite-utils tool</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___simonwillison_net_2021_Aug_6_sqlite-utils-convert_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="primary">

<div>




<p>Earlier this week I released <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-14">sqlite-utils 3.14</a> with a powerful new command-line tool: <code>sqlite-utils convert</code>, which applies a conversion function to data stored in a SQLite column.</p>
<p>Anyone who works with data will tell you that 90% of the work is cleaning it up. Running command-line conversions against data in a SQLite file turns out to be a really productive way to do that.</p>
<h4>Transforming a column</h4>
<p>Here’s a simple example. Say someone gave you data with numbers that are formatted with commas—like <code>3,044,502</code>—in a <code>count</code> column in a <code>states</code> table.</p>
<p>You can strip those commas out like so:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert states.db states count \
    &#39;value.replace(&#34;,&#34;, &#34;&#34;)&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>convert</code> command takes four arguments: the database file, the name of the table, the name of the column and a string containing a fragment of Python code that defines the conversion to be applied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The conversion function can be anything you can express with Python. If you want to import extra modules you can do so using <code>--import module</code>—here’s an example that wraps text using the <a href="">textwrap</a> module from the Python standard library:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert content.db articles content \
    &#39;&#34;\n&#34;.join(textwrap.wrap(value, 100))&#39; \
    --import=textwrap
</code></pre>
<p>You can consider this analogous to using <code>Array.map()</code> in JavaScript, or applying a transformation in a Python list comprehension in Python.</p>
<h4>Custom functions in SQLite</h4>
<p>Under the hood, the tool takes advantage of a powerful SQLite feature: the ability to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.create_function">register custom functions</a> written in Python (or other languages) and call them from SQL.</p>
<p>The text wrapping example above works by executing the following SQL:</p>
<div><pre><span>update</span> articles <span>set</span> content <span>=</span> convert_value(content)</pre></div>
<p><code>convert_value(value)</code> is a custom SQL function, compiled as Python code and then made available to the database connection.</p>
<p>The equivalent code using just the Python standard library would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>sqlite3</span>
<span>import</span> <span>textwrap</span>

<span>def</span> <span>convert_value</span>(<span>value</span>):
    <span>return</span> <span>&#34;<span>\n</span>&#34;</span>.<span>join</span>(<span>textwrap</span>.<span>wrap</span>(<span>value</span>, <span>100</span>))

<span>conn</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlite3</span>.<span>connect</span>(<span>&#34;content.db&#34;</span>)
<span>conn</span>.<span>create_function</span>(<span>&#34;convert_value&#34;</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>convert_value</span>)
<span>conn</span>.<span>execute</span>(<span>&#34;update articles set content = convert_value(content)&#34;</span>)</pre>
<p><code>sqlite-utils convert</code> works by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/blob/cc90745f4e8bb1ac57d8ee973863cfe00c2e4fe5/sqlite_utils/cli.py#L2019-L2028">compiling the code argument</a> to a Python function, registering it with the connection and executing the above SQL query.</p>
<h4>Splitting columns into multiple other columns</h4>
<p>Sometimes when I’m working with a table I find myself wanting to split a column into multiple other columns.</p>
<p>A classic example is locations—if a <code>location</code> column contains <code>latitude,longitude</code> values I’ll often want to split that into separate <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns, so I can visualize the data with <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--multi</code> option lets you do that using <code>sqlite-utils convert</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert data.db places location &#39;
latitude, longitude = value.split(&#34;,&#34;)
return {
    &#34;latitude&#34;: float(latitude),
    &#34;longitude&#34;: float(longitude),
}&#39; --multi
</code></pre>
<p><code>--multi</code> tells the command to expect the Python code to return dictionaries. It will then create new columns in the database corresponding to the keys in those dictionaries and populate them using the results of the transformation.</p>
<p>If the <code>places</code> table started with just a <code>location</code> column, after running the above command the new table schema will look like this:</p>
<div><pre>CREATE TABLE [places] (
    [location] <span>TEXT</span>,
    [latitude] FLOAT,
    [longitude] FLOAT
);</pre></div>
<h4>Common recipes</h4>
<p>This new feature in <code>sqlite-utils</code> actually started life as a separate tool entirely, called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform">sqlite-transform</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the rationale for adding it to <code>sqlite-utils</code> was to avoid confusion between what that tool did and the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-advanced-alter-table/">sqlite-utils transform</a> tool, which does something completely different (applies table transformations that aren’t possible using SQLite’s default <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement). Somewhere along the line I messed up with the naming of the two tools!</p>
<p><code>sqlite-transform</code> bundles a number of useful <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-transform/blob/main/README.md#parsedate-and-parsedatetime">default transformation recipes</a>, in addition to allowing arbitrary Python code. I ended up making these available in <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> by exposing them as functions that can be called from the command-line code argument like so:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert my.db articles created_at \
    &#39;r.parsedate(value)&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Implementing them as Python functions in this way meant I didn’t need to invent a new command-line mechanism for passing in additional options to the individual recipes—instead, parameters are passed like this:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert my.db articles created_at \
    &#39;r.parsedate(value, dayfirst=True)&#39;
</code></pre>
<h4>Also available in the sqlite_utils Python library</h4>
<p>Almost every feature that is exposed by the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils command-line tool</a> has a matching API in the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite_utils Python library</a>. <code>convert</code> is no exception.</p>
<p>The Python API lets you perform operations like the following:</p>
<pre><span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqlite_utils</span>.<span>Database</span>(<span>&#34;dogs.db&#34;</span>)

<span>db</span>[<span>&#34;dogs&#34;</span>].<span>convert</span>(<span>&#34;name&#34;</span>, <span>lambda</span> <span>value</span>: <span>value</span>.<span>upper</span>())</pre>
<p>Any Python callable can be passed to <code>convert</code>, and it will be applied to every value in the specified column—again, like using <code>map()</code> to apply a transformation to every item in an array.</p>
<p>You can also use the Python API to perform more complex operations like the following two examples:</p>
<pre><span># Convert title to upper case only for rows with id &gt; 20</span>
<span>table</span>.<span>convert</span>(
    <span>&#34;title&#34;</span>,
    <span>lambda</span> <span>v</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>upper</span>(),
    <span>where</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;id &gt; :id&#34;</span>,
    <span>where_args</span><span>=</span>{<span>&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span>20</span>}
)

<span># Create two new columns, &#34;upper&#34; and &#34;lower&#34;,</span>
<span># and populate them from the converted title</span>
<span>table</span>.<span>convert</span>(
    <span>&#34;title&#34;</span>,
    <span>lambda</span> <span>v</span>: {
        <span>&#34;upper&#34;</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>upper</span>(),
        <span>&#34;lower&#34;</span>: <span>v</span>.<span>lower</span>()
    }, <span>multi</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>
)</pre>

<h4 id="blog-performance">A more sophisticated example: analyzing log files</h4>
<p>I used the new <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> command earlier today, to debug a performance issue with my blog.</p>
<p>Most of my blog traffic is served via Cloudflare with a 15 minute cache timeout—but occasionally I’ll hit an uncached page, and they had started to feel not quite as snappy as I would expect.</p>
<p>So I dipped into the Heroku dashboard, and saw this pretty sad looking graph:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Somehow my 50th percentile was nearly 10 seconds, and my maximum page response time was 23 seconds! Something was clearly very wrong.</p>
<p>I use NGINX as part of my Heroku setup to buffer responses (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/2/nginx-heroku/">Running gunicorn behind nginx on Heroku for buffering and logging</a>), and I have custom NGINX configuration to write to the Heroku logs—mainly to work around a limitation in Heroku’s default logging where it fails to record full user-agents or referrer headers.</p>
<p>I extended that configuration to record the NGINX <code>request_time</code>, <code>upstream_response_time</code>, <code>upstream_connect_time</code> and <code>upstream_header_time</code> variables, which I hoped would help me figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/dd0faaa64c0e361ae1d760894e201cac7b0224a4">applying that change</a> I started seeing Heroku log lines that looked like this:</p>
<p><code>2021-08-05T17:58:28.880469+00:00 app[web.1]: measure#nginx.service=4.212 request=&#34;GET /search/?type=blogmark&amp;page=2&amp;tag=highavailability HTTP/1.1&#34; status_code=404 request_id=25eb296e-e970-4072-b75a-606e11e1db5b remote_addr=&#34;10.1.92.174&#34; forwarded_for=&#34;114.119.136.88, 172.70.142.28&#34; forwarded_proto=&#34;http&#34; via=&#34;1.1 vegur&#34; body_bytes_sent=179 referer=&#34;-&#34; user_agent=&#34;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0;) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)&#34; request_time=&#34;4.212&#34; upstream_response_time=&#34;4.212&#34; upstream_connect_time=&#34;0.000&#34; upstream_header_time=&#34;4.212&#34;;</code></p>
<p>Next step: analyze those log lines.</p>
<p>I ran this command for a few minutes to gather some logs:</p>
<p><code>heroku logs -a simonwillisonblog --tail | grep &#39;measure#nginx.service&#39; &gt; /tmp/log.txt</code></p>
<p>Having collected 488 log lines, the next step was to load them into SQLite.</p>
<p>The <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> command likes to work with JSON, but I just had raw log lines. I used <code>jq</code> to convert each line into a <code>{&#34;line&#34;: &#34;raw log line&#34;}</code> JSON object, then piped that as newline-delimited JSON into <code>sqlite-utils insert</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat /tmp/log.txt | \
    jq --raw-input &#39;{line: .}&#39; --compact-output | \
    sqlite-utils insert /tmp/logs.db log - --nl
</code></pre>
<p><code>jq --raw-input</code> accepts input that is just raw lines of text, not yet valid JSON. <code>&#39;{line: .}&#39;</code> is a tiny <code>jq</code> program that builds <code>{&#34;line&#34;: &#34;raw input&#34;}</code> objects. <code>--compact-output</code> causes <code>jq</code> to output newline-delimited JSON.</p>
<p>Then <code>sqlite-utils insert /tmp/logs.db log - --nl</code> reads that newline-delimited JSON into a new SQLite <code>log</code> table in a <code>logs.db</code> database file (<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-newline-delimited-json">full documentation here</a>).</p>
<p>Now I had a SQLite table with a single column, <code>line</code>. Next step: parse that nasty log format.</p>
<p>To my surprise I couldn’t find an existing Python library for parsing <code>key=value key2=&#34;quoted value&#34;</code> log lines. Instead I had to figure out a regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>([^\s=]+)=(?:&#34;(.*?)&#34;|(\S+))
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s that expression visualized using <a href="https://www.debuggex.com/">Debuggex</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used that regular expression as part of a custom function passed in to the <code>sqlite-utils convert</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils convert /tmp/logs.db log line --import re --multi &#34;$(cat &lt;&lt;EOD
    r = re.compile(r&#39;([^\s=]+)=(?:&#34;(.*?)&#34;|(\S+))&#39;)
    pairs = {}
    for key, value1, value2 in r.findall(value):
        pairs[key] = value1 or value2
    return pairs
EOD
)&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>(This uses a <code>cat &lt;&lt;EOD</code> trick to avoid having to figure out how to escape the single and double quotes in the Python code for usage in a zsh shell command.)</p>
<p>Using <code>--multi</code> here created new columns for each of the key/value pairs seen in that log file.</p>
<p>One last step: convert the types. The new columns are all of type <code>text</code> but I want to do sorting and arithmetic on them so I need to convert them to integers and floats. I used <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#transforming-tables">sqlite-utils transform</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils transform /tmp/logs.db log \
    --type &#39;measure#nginx.service&#39; float \
    --type &#39;status_code&#39; integer \
    --type &#39;body_bytes_sent&#39; integer \
    --type &#39;request_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_response_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_connect_time&#39; float \
    --type &#39;upstream_header_time&#39; float
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://simonwillison-net-performance-logs.vercel.app/logs/log">resulting log table</a> (published using <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-publish-vercel">datasette-publish-vercel</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the logs were in Datasette, the problem quickly became apparent when I <a href="https://simonwillison-net-performance-logs.vercel.app/logs/log?_sort_desc=request_time">sorted by request_time</a>: an army of search engine crawlers were hitting deep linked filters in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/5/django-postgresql-faceted-search/">my faceted search engine</a>, like <code>/search/?tag=geolocation&amp;tag=offlineresources&amp;tag=canvas&amp;tag=javascript&amp;tag=performance&amp;tag=dragndrop&amp;tag=crossdomain&amp;tag=mozilla&amp;tag=video&amp;tag=tracemonkey&amp;year=2009&amp;type=blogmark</code>. These are expensive pages to generate! They’re also very unlikely to be in my Cloudflare cache.</p>
<p>Could the answer be as simple as a <code>robots.txt</code> rule blocking access to <code>/search/</code>?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/4c0de5b9f01bb16fc89c587128a276055b0033bb">shipped that change</a> and waited a few hours to see what the impact would be:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It took a while for the crawlers to notice that my <code>robots.txt</code> had changed, but by 8 hours later my site performance was dramatically improved—I’m now seeing 99th percentile of around 450ms, compared to 25 seconds before I shipped the <code>robots.txt</code> change!</p>
<p>With this latest addition, <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> has evolved into a powerful tool for importing, cleaning and re-shaping data—especially when coupled with Datasette in order to explore, analyze and publish the results.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by scientific discoveries that are hanging right in front of our noses. Cryptic species are one such surprise. Sometimes, researchers using genetic sequencing are surprised to discover that a group of animals that all look the same from the outside are actually reproductively isolated from each other; separate twigs on the tree of life. This surprise has happened over and over in the history of natural science. </p>



<p>It turns out such puzzles are frequent among the giant clams. These unusual bivalves are specialists in coral reef environments, growing to large size with the help of symbiotic algae that create sugars through photosynthesis. Within the genus <em>Tridacna </em>there are ~10 accepted species which vary in size, shape, color and mode of life. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tridacna squamosina</em> (right) sitting next to the small giant clam <em>T. maxima</em> (left) on the Israeli Red Sea coast</figcaption></figure>



<p>I specialize in the three species known (so far) from the Red Sea, including the small giant clam <em>Tridacna maxima</em> and the fluted giant clam <em>T. squamosa</em>, which are both found worldwide, all the way from the Red Sea to down past the equator along the Great Barrier Reef. The third local species, <em>T. squamosina </em>is more unusual, so far being only known from the Red Sea (an endemic species). <em>T. squamosina</em> is an example of a cryptic species, having previously been assumed to be a local variant of <em>T. squamosa</em>. It looks pretty similar, with long scutes (flap-like appendages) protruding from its shell, thought to help stabilize it on the flat bottom of loose coral rubble. But unlike <em>T. squamosa</em>, <em>T. squamosina</em> lives exclusively at the top of the reef in the shallowest waters closest to the sun. It has a very angular, zig-zag pattern in its plications (the wavy shapes at the edge of the shell) and a characteristic pair of green stripes where the soft tissue meets the edges of the shell.

<p>It was only first described in detail in the early 2000s, when an international team of researchers figured out using genetic sequencing that it was a distinct species and named it <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220800969X" target="_blank">T. costata</a></em>. They noted that in their surveys all around the shores of the Red Sea, they only found 13 live specimens, making it an extremely rare and possibly endangered species. Fossil specimens on local reefs appeared to be much more common, suggesting it had a much larger population in the past. Then in 2011, another team at the Natural History Museum in Vienna <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291351279_Tridacna_Chametrachea_costata_ROA-QUIAOIT_KOCHZIUS_JANTZEN_AL-ZIBDAH_RICHTER_from_the_Red_Sea_a_Junior_synonym_of_Tridacna_squamosina_STURANY_1899_Bivalvia_Tridacnidae" target="_blank">discovered </a>a shell of one had been forgotten in its collection for over 100 years. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Sturany" target="_blank">Rudolf Sturany,</a> the researcher on the 1895 research cruise who had originally collected the clam, had called it <em>T. squamosina</em>. </p>

<p>In taxonomy (the science of naming and classifying organisms), the first team to name the species wins, so the name <em>T. costata</em> was synonymized (retired) in favor of the earlier name <em>T. squamosina</em>, which became the name of record. It must be annoying to spend so much time working to name a species and then discover you had been scooped over a century before! But such is science. </p>



<figure><figcaption>A mystery clam thought to be <em>T. squamosina</em>, later identified as <em>T. elongatissima</em> found off of Mozambique by iNaturalist user <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/33747678">bewambay </a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The strange part was that there were some murmurs over the last few years that <em>T. squamosina</em> was not only found in the Red Sea, but also had been seen along the coast of Africa as far south as Kenya, Mozambique and Madagascar. Divers and snorkelers had taken pictures of a giant clam that did indeed look strangely like <em>T. squamosina</em>, with a zigzag shell opening and green stripes at the edge of its tissue. But some aspects of these individuals seemed off. In the Red Sea, <em>T. squamosina</em> lives freely, not embedded in the coral as these pictures showed, and the geometry of the angles of the shell seemed a bit different. It also would be difficult for <em>T. squamosina</em> to be connected in population from the Red Sea all the way South to Mozambique, as there are natural barriers which would prevent its planktonic larvae from riding currents to intermix between the two regions. When populations are separated by a barrier, the flow of genes between them is cut off and evolution begins to separate the populations from each other until they are separate species, a process called allopatric speciation.</p>

<p>I figured that someday, researchers would collect tissue samples from these mystery clams to settle whether they were actually <em>T. squamosina</em> or something else.  And this year, a team <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.13797?casa_token=judEiv9BdwgAAAAA%3AiNdNr-KL8f3IPmPqJAMwrjNoHGQURjZQztBulAahXxi_Hx9HHuvWTOW_tSwNtf8z_YOpXtXCelRaow">did just that</a>, traveling along the coast of Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya and other places, collecting samples of tissue to compare how all the different clams they saw were related in a family tree. They genetically sequenced these “clamples” and in the process, found that the mystery clams were a new cryptic species, which they called <em>T. elongatissima</em>!</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>Shells of <em>T. elongatissima </em>from the Fauvelot et al. 2020 paper</figcaption></figure></div>



<figure><figcaption>For comparison, a shell of <em>T. squamosina</em> collected off of Sinai, Egypt. You can see why they’re easy to mix up!</figcaption></figure>



<p>T<em>. elongatissima </em>closely resembles <em>T. squamosina</em>, and they are sister species on the bivalve family tree. It’s hard to tell them apart without training. Even a professional would probably mix some of them up if they were all placed sitting next to each other. The major differences appear to relate to shell shape, with <em>T. elongatissima</em> having a less symmetrical shell than <em>T. squamosina</em>, and a bigger opening at the rear hinge for a foot to poke through. The symmetrical shell and closing of the foot opening may represent changes that <em>T. squamosina</em> took on to adapt to be able to sit freely on the bottom, rather than embedding in the coral like <em>T. elongatissima</em> seems to prefer. If you’ve read this far, you may be thinking “Who cares? A clam’s a clam and these look practically the same. Aren’t you just splitting clams at this point?” At the end of the day, a species is a man-made concept; an organizing tool for use by us humans. Species are the characters in our reconstruction of the history of the world. What can we learn about the world by having identified this species <em>T. elongatissima</em>?</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>A giant clam family tree! Notice <em>T. squamosina</em> and <em>T. elongatissima </em>right next to each other.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers behind the new paper discuss that based on statistical analyses of the genetic differences between the species, the most recent common ancestor for <em>T. elongatissima</em> and <em>T. squamosina</em> probably lived more than 1.4 million years ago! Some researchers have previously suggested that <em>T. squamosina</em> probably began its development as a separate species due to geographic isolation by low sea level, caused by repeated glaciations. With so much water trapped as ice on land during this period, the narrow Strait of Bab al Mandab, currently the gateway to the Red Sea, became a land barrier as sea level fell (kind of like opposite of the Bering Sea land bridge that formed allowing humans to migrate to the Americas). Ancestral clams trapped on the Northern end of this barrier were proposed to have evolved to become the rare <em>T. squamosina</em>. </p>



<p>This has occurred with a variety of species that became Red Sea endemics (meaning they are unique species that evolved in the Red Sea and are found nowhere else), including a unique crown of thorns starfish. The issue is that during this time of low sea level, the Red Sea went through periods where it was a rather unfriendly place for clams to live. All sorts of creatures went extinct in the period when the sea was repeatedly cut off, because the water became extremely salty, along with other unfriendly changes. So it’s unlikely <em>T. squamosina</em> would be present for us to see today if it only lived in the Red Sea throughout the entire length of time.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>A map from Fauvelot et al. 2020 showing the distributions of different giant clams the researchers identified along the coasts of Africa and the Red Sea. Notice the bright red dots representing <em>T. squamosina</em>, only found in the Red Sea, while green dots represent <em>T. elongatissima</em>. Notice how the currents (arrows) seem to meet and then go offshore from Kenya. More on that in the next paragraph. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The researchers of this new paper propose that <em>T. squamosina</em> was more likely to have initially branched off due to the barrier of the Horn of Africa. The seas off of Kenya and Somalia harbor a meeting of southward and northward currents which then group and head offshore, away from the reefs that giant clam larvae are trying to get to. So any tiny floating planktonic clam larvae would experience a strong “headwind” preventing them from crossing that point. It would also mean that during times that the Red Sea was not a happy place to be a clam, <em>T. squamosina</em> may have found refuge on the coasts of places like Eritrea, Oman and possibly even as far as Pakistan. During times when sea levels rose and Red Sea conditions became friendlier, it recolonized the area. </p>



<p>As far as we know, the Red Sea is the only place<em> T. squamosina </em>is now found, but it may well be present elsewhere like Yemen or Oman. If <em>T. squamosina</em> was found in other regions, it would be tremendously important for its conservation. Right now, the species is thought to be extremely rare, with a very small native range. If it inhabited a broader area, that would mean more reservoirs of genetic diversity. This would reduce the odds that it will go extinct as reefs are put under stress from climate change, pollution and overharvesting. To survive as a species, it helps to not put all your eggs in one basket. If you’re only found in one small place, it increases the chances that a disaster (like climate change) will wipe you out. </p>



<p>The only way we will know for sure is to visit reefs in understudied places like Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, Eritrea and Somalia, to understand the richness of the giant clams present. These areas are understudied for various reasons: lack of research funding for non-Western researchers, lack of interest from the scientific community too focused on familiar places, and geopolitical situations that make it difficult to conduct research. But I hope someday to collaborate with people in these countries to better understand the giant clams present in such understudied regions of the globe. It is virtually certain that there are more species of giant clams, both alive and as fossils, waiting to be discovered. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>I</span></span><span>n July 2008, I rented a small yellow car in Tucson, Arizona, and drove it south towards Tombstone. My passengers included an entomologist and two microbial geneticists, and I was following a white van with government plates carrying nine more geneticists. We also had 500 plastic bags, a vacuum flask of dry ice, and 350 cryogenic vials, each the size and shape of a pencil stub. We had two days to get 10,000 termites.</span></p><p>The goal was to sequence the genes of the microbes in their guts. Because termites are famously good at eating wood, those genes were attractive to government labs trying to turn wood and grass into biofuels (“grassoline”). The white van and the geneticists all belonged to the US Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute. Perhaps by seeing exactly how termites break down wood, we’d be able to do it too.</p><p>We stopped in the Coronado national forest, near the border with Mexico. I lifted a rock and saw a glint of glossy exoskeleton flowing into some little tunnels. I dropped to my knees and began sucking on an aspirator, a disgusting process that stimulated saliva production and made me dizzy. Two minutes later, there were no more termites on the ground and I had about 25 in the test tube attached to the aspirator.</p><p>But my pale termites were disappointing. When I separated one from the clutch, it was less substantial than a baby’s fingernail clipping. Doddering around blindly, it waved the flimsy antennae on its bulbous head. In its stubby, translucent body I could almost see its coiled guts – and presumably whatever it had eaten for lunch. Ants have snazzy bodies with three sections, highlighted by narrow waists, like a pinup model’s, between the segments. Termites, which are no relation to ants or bees, have round, eyeless heads, thick necks and teardrop-shaped bodies. And they long ago lost cockroaches’ repulsive dignity, gnarly size and gleaming chitinous armour. I put the termite back in the test tube.</p><p>What had I just sucked up? My little gang of 25 was incapable of doing much of anything. Without a colony, they had nowhere to bring food to, and thus no reason to forage. Without a crowd of soldiers, they couldn’t defend themselves. Without a queen, they couldn’t reproduce. Twenty-five termites are insignificant in the scheme of life and death and reproduction. Meaningless. What’s more, they were clinging to one another, making an icky beige rope of termite heads, bodies and legs reminiscent of the game Barrel of Monkeys. In the miniature scrum I couldn’t even see a single termite – they looked like a clot, not a group of individuals. Or perhaps I had found a single individual who happened to have 25 selves.</p><p>I had stumbled into one of the big questions termites pose, which is, roughly, what is “one” termite? Is it one individual termite? Is it one termite with its symbiotic gut microbes, an entity that can eat wood but cannot reproduce on its own? Or is it a colony, a whole living, breathing structure, occupied by a few million related individuals and a gazillion symbionts who collectively constitute “one”?</p><p>The issue of one is profound in every direction, with evolutionary, ecological and existential implications. By the end of that day I had a basic idea that the fewer I saw, the more termites there might be. Where I had thought of landscapes as the product of growth, on that afternoon they inverted to become the opposite: the remainders left behind by the forces of persistent and massive chewing. The sky was no longer the sky, but the blue stuff that is visible after the screening brush and cacti have been eaten away. Termites have made the world by unmaking parts of it. They are the architects of negative space. The engineers of not.</p><hr/><p><span><span>N</span></span><span>obody loves termites, even though other social insects such as ants and bees are admired for their organisation, thrift and industry. Parents dress their children in bee costumes. Ants star in movies and video games. But termites are never more than crude cartoons on the side of exterminators’ vans. Termite studies are likewise a backwater, funded mostly by government agencies and companies with names such as Terminix. Between 2000 and 2013, 6,373 papers about termites were published; 49% were about how to kill them.</span></p><p>Every story about termites mentions that they consume somewhere between $1.5bn (£1.1bn) and $20bn in US property every year. Termites’ offence is often described as the eating of “private” property, which makes them sound like anticapitalist anarchists. While termites are truly subversive, it’s fair to point out that they will eat anything pulpy. They find money itself to be very tasty. In 2011 they broke into <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13194864" title="" data-link-name="in body link">an Indian bank and ate 10m rupees</a> (then £137,000) in banknotes. In 2013 they ate 400,000 yuan (then £45,000) that a woman in Guangdong had <a href="http://shanghaiist.com/2013/06/10/termites_eat_guangdong_grandmothers_life_savings/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">wrapped in plastic and hidden in a wooden drawer</a>.</p><figure id="e83387f1-9fd2-4133-85f3-62731b8a691b"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a67e22fb092d40a577e4276562255a2f 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c2d11382d2334df875ff45f235893a4d 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=fce44f2afdf10eca07c94cf0c94be5d2 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=fce44f2afdf10eca07c94cf0c94be5d2 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=615708eb93e2863d48473c7a61120dce 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=930277c9d5c25ebd4a23f95a61576dfd 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=4b3429b5c79891c2c806a5423c9753e6 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=18395152240b8c5fbb34993e2e64f644 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d06fe74a3891b8cc5ca8b15a5db16489 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448ef50fe9a1906c4242829b799f18fd 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=448ef50fe9a1906c4242829b799f18fd 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d019a70f1c9c127153429fa3012479f2 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=60d17cecf858c18c22fde6c0f624ace7 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea7d4ce2834ac1ef7d367bdde4178b0468708b/0_163_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=75bb58ce1ca04cf6fb26b5322d010a3b 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Harvester termite workers.</span> Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Another statistic seems relevant: termites outweigh us 10 to one. For every 60kg human you, according to the termite expert David Bignell, there are 600kg of them. We may live in our own self-titled epoch – the Anthropocene – but termites run the dirt. They are our underappreciated underlords, key players in a vast planetary conspiracy of disassembly and decay. If termites, ants and bees were to go on strike, the tropics’ pyramid of interdependence would collapse into infertility, the world’s most important rivers would silt up and the oceans would become toxic. Game over.</p><p>By the end of our termite-collecting trip we had 8,000 termites in plastic tubs and bags, but they needed to be labelled and stored in dry ice before going to California to be sequenced. Once frozen in the vacuum flask, the termites were on their way to immortality: a collection of genetic code sitting in some database on a server somewhere, intellectual property, a sequence of nucleotides that might solve a wicked problem some day.</p><p>We were on the border between natural history and an unnatural future. We weren’t alone: all over the world, scientists are trying to find biology’s underlying rules and put them to use. They’re doing it with genes, behaviours, metabolisms and ecosystems. They’re seeing nature in new ways, and at the same time they’re trying to reinvent it and put it to work for us. In the future, we will harness nature’s tiniest life forms – microbes and insects – both their systems of organisation and control, and their genes and chemical capabilities. This fits with our paradoxical desire to have a lighter footprint on the Earth while having greater control over its processes.</p><p>At the core of this project is the provocative dream of changing biology into a predictive science, much the way physics started as the observation of phenomena such as gravity and then became the science of making plans for the atom bomb. Will there be termite bombs?</p><p>Termites, I came to understand, are the poster bug for the 21st century – a little guide to really big ideas.</p><hr/><p><span><span>T</span></span><span>ermite colonies begin theatrically on rainy evenings. Small holes open in the sides of existing termite homes and largish, winged termites emerge, shake out their sticky wings, and fly. In northern California, termites of the genus <em>Reticulitermes</em> suddenly appear on the sides of buildings they inhabit. In South America, <em>Nasutitermes</em> shower down from nests in the trees. In New Orleans, Formosan termites, of the genus <em>Coptotermes</em>, burp from colonies in the ground and take to the air in swarms so dense they show up on weather radar. In Namibia, giant <em>Macrotermes</em> mounds seem to spring a leak, spilling froths of winged termites down their sides.</span></p><p>In the mound, most of the termites are eyeless and wingless, but the fertile termites who leave the mound on this night have eyes and what at first appears to be one single translucent teardrop-shaped wing. When they are ready to fly, this single wing, still soft and moist, fans out into four. Called “alates”, these termites are like fragile balsa-wood glider planes: just sturdy enough to cruise briefly before crash-landing their payloads of genes.</p><p>Male and female find each other and scuttle off to dig a burrow where they will mate. At first the two termites will be alone in their dark hole. Christine Nalepa, Theo Evans and Michael Lenz have written that termite parents bite off the ends of their antennae, which may make them better at raising their young. Antennae give termites lots of sensory information, and biting off the segments toward the ends could reduce that stimulation, making it easier to live in a tiny burrow with a few million children.</p><p>After she has laid her first eggs, the queen cleans them often to remove harmful fungi until they hatch as nymphs about three weeks later. The nymphs will moult grow and develop, but under the influence of the queen’s pheromone, most of them won’t fully mature, remaining permanent stay-at-home preteens – eyeless, wingless helpers.</p><p>Males and females alike will spend their time gathering food, tending eggs, building the nest deeper into the ground and eventually tending a fungus. As the family grows bigger, some morph into soldiers; their heads grow larger, dark-coloured and hard in a distinctive way, depending on their species. Thereafter they must be fed by their siblings the workers. Soldiers appear to return the favour by dosing the colony with antimicrobial secretions that help it resist disease.</p><p>Over time, in the small smooth dirt room where she lives, the queen’s body becomes “physogastric”, her abdomen swelling to the size of my thumb, constricted by taut black bands remaining from her old exoskeleton so she looks like a soft sausage that has been carelessly bound with string. Her head, thorax and legs remain tiny. Immobilised, except for the ability to wave her legs and bobble her head, she lays eggs at the rate of one every three or so seconds. The king stays by her. Her children lick off the liquid that appears on her skin, feed her and care for the eggs.</p><p>Or at least, that’s life for some <em>Macrotermes</em> queens (the genus found in Africa and south-east Asia, that builds its mound around a massive fungus). There are, however, at least 3,000 named termite species, and thus at least 3,000 ways to be termites. Some have multiple queens; some have cloned kings or queens; some are, improbably, founded by two male termites. One species doesn’t really have workers. Different species eat wood, others eat grass and some eat dirt. <em>Macrotermes</em> tend a fungus, but most others do not. All termites, though, live in their own version of a big commune.</p><figure id="85ea937f-a4fc-4e07-9042-90309b0df869"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a14c3a55bb07a0d26d12aa70eb4e332e 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=dfe296c906aa5c29bc95775b91044b1a 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0dbcdf2acd565e4b728ca4856b47a023 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0dbcdf2acd565e4b728ca4856b47a023 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7cc4ef19257e98dc2391e2dad9617914 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7acd4060e0c0435b7dc577a0f8e2e916 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=3d48682bd0e6949cf2b4613a3d45bde5 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=862e30865cbaa1d5ab33b2ef4512ba71 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f58e8e7d27db59265096b3bf4ac1909a 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=afbbd0828db138efa263f4a1ddf9906a 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=afbbd0828db138efa263f4a1ddf9906a 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a3f3c804c2543169836a4e862d72aac1 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f8a0a2c3f2cec72a910a73cf5f355a14 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb534d17ffc7d4a167e6d668b0e121e49041546a/0_398_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=18b8928912eaf12b34cca4cfb3d00ce4 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Zebras by a termite mound in Okonjima, Namibia.</span> Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</figcaption></figure><p>The South African writer Eugène Marais spent many years peering into their mounds and wrote The Soul of the White Ant, originally published in English in 1937. Marais called the termite mound a “composite animal”, uniting the millions of sterile workers, the soldiers, the fat queen and the king with the dirt structure of the mound itself into a single body. “You will need to learn a new alphabet,” he warned his readers before leading them in. The hard-packed dirt on the outside of the mound, he said, is a skin constructed by termites, which build passageways inside that allow the mound to breathe – like a lung. The organism’s stomach is the symbiotic fungus that sits in catacombs under the mound, digesting grasses delivered by termites. The mound’s “mouth” can be found in the hundreds of foraging tunnels the termites construct through the surrounding landscape. Because they carry nutrients and rebuild the mound, the sterile workers resemble blood cells. The mound’s “immune system” is the soldiers, who rush to defend the space whenever it is invaded.</p><p>To Marais, the queen was no Victoria, but instead a captive ovary, walled into a chamber no bigger than her swollen, sweating body. Marais imagined that eventually the mound would evolve into a being that could move across the veldt – very slowly in its dirt skin – a monster hybrid of soil and soul. Marais’s insight wasn’t original, and many scientists had taken to calling such social arrangements of termites, bees and ants “superorganisms”. The originator of the term was the entomologist William Wheeler, the founder of the study of ants in the US, author of a 1911 article called The Ant-Colony as an Organism.</p><p>For a time, superorganisms were all the rage. The concept dealt neatly with what Charles Darwin had called the “problem” with social insects. Darwin’s theory of evolution proposed that natural selection worked on individuals and the fittest individuals bred with others similarly fit to their ecological niche, while the less fit were less likely to reproduce. The problem with social insects was that while single termites seem to be individuals, they do not function as such. Only the queen and king of a colony breed, so who was the “individual”? By declaring the whole colony the individual, Wheeler said its members made up “a living whole bent on preserving its moving equilibrium and its integrity”.</p><p>In the late 1920s and early 30s, the paradigm of the superorganism grew colossal. Instead of studying individual trees, biologists studied forests as superorganisms. By 1931, the concept snuck into popular culture when Aldous Huxley reportedly based the dictatorship in Brave New World on humans as social insects, with five castes. Wheeler proposed that “trophallaxis” – a word he invented for the way insects regurgitate and share food among themselves – was the secret sauce, the superglue of societies both insect and human, and the foundation of economics. But even during the superorganism’s heyday, Marais was alone in his assertion that the mound had a soul.</p><hr/><p><span><span>I</span></span><span>n Namibia, I went to meet J Scott Turner, an American biologist who has spent decades studying how and why termites build their mounds. It took Turner years of experiments to show that mounds could work a bit like lungs, with interconnected chambers taking advantage of fluctuations in wind speed. Air moves back and forth through the porous dirt skin of the mound by two systems: in big puffs driven by buoyant gases rising from the hot fungus nest (like the sharp intake of breath from the diaphragm), and in small puffs, the way air wheezily diffuses between alveoli in your lungs. Turner suspected that the termites themselves circulated air as they moved, like mobile alveoli. This insight was an entirely new way of thinking about the problem. The mound was not a simple structure where air happened to move, but a continuously morphing complex contraption consisting of dirt and termites together manipulating airflow.</span></p><p>Termites who spend a year building an average mound of 3 metres have just built, in comparison to their size, the Empire State Building. Those who build taller mounds, at nearly 5 metres, have just built the Burj Khalifa in Dubai – 830 metres and 163 floors of vertigo – with no architect and no structural engineer. Such unthinking, seat-of-the-pants design is not possible for humans, who required squads of professionals, advanced equipment and 7,500 people working for six years to build the Burj Khalifa. Working with Turner, engineer Rupert Soar hoped to harness the powerful constructive groupthink that comes from the tiny mouths of termites and their even tinier brains to build structures in remote environments such as Mars. But there were issues: termites, he said, engineer to the point of collapse.</p><p>One morning a JCB arrived and Turner directed it to a mound. The JCB’s great blade came down on the top of the mound with a hollow whomp, the first note of a funny little concert. Half the mound fell away with a tumbling clinking clatter – as the shards hit different layers of cured mud they played a tune like a soft xylophone. We pushed in close, enveloped by the familiar smell of socks and bread.</p><p>What was left of the mound was a ruined hierarchy. Dirt shards and fungus combs and sculpted mud plinked downward, while termites ran every which way, at first as a sort of gauzy net. Soon they had organised themselves into small streams, and within 10 minutes those streams had consolidated into rivers of running insects. As order was restored, I could see the elaborate scheme of tunnels, rooms, chambers and fungus hidden under the dirt exterior. The spectacle was genuinely awesome – as in jaw-dropping and appalling.</p><p>The top of the mound was hollow, with wide vertical tunnels. The interiors of these tunnels were very smooth, and they segued in and out of each other in ropey vertiginous columns like a sloppy braid. Termites make the mounds by first piling up dirt and then removing it strategically in the tunnels. Eyeless, they use their antennae to feel for smoothness, and in the big tunnels they remove everything that is rough. They may even hear the tunnel’s shape.</p><p>Termites are often compared to architects for the way they build their mounds, but that is misleading because they don’t have plans or a global vision. What they really have is an aesthetic, an innate sense of how things should feel. When the top of the spire was first ripped off, there were just a few termites in the solitary tunnels at the top, probably listening to the clopping of their own six feet. But cutting into the top allowed in lots of fresh air at once, and activated an alarm system. Some termites ran away from the hole, agitating their brothers and sisters so they could help with repairs. Thousands of worker termites followed the smell of fresh air to find the hole, carrying balls of dirt in their mouths. Within minutes of the JCB strike, streams of termites canvassed the broken side of the mound, moving in a frantic start-stop pattern like a shaky old animated cartoon. I leaned in further and could see that each termite put its ball of dirt down on a ball left by the previous termite, wiggled his or her head, perhaps to get the ball to stick, and then backed away. Where there were two balls there were soon 20 and then 200, then 2,000. Some of these stacks joined up with other stacks at the perimeter of the breaks in the mound to form little bumpy, frilly walls.</p><p>Once the area was walled off, the signal from the fresh air would stop and the termites would fill the internal space with more dirt balls and small tunnels, making a sort of spongy layer. Later they would either block it off entirely or would hollow it out and remodel it. The JCB came back in for another swipe, taking away the dirt below the mound to reveal the system of horizontal galleries, tunnels and chambers where the termites live. It reminded me of those diagrams of cruise ships, visualised from the side, with small rooms packed together in a strict hierarchy of function and status from ballrooms and cafeterias to VIP staterooms and steerage bunks. The colony’s hierarchy is not money, of course, but the things that enable its survival: reproduction, child care, food supply and food processing. Some rooms are large, with vaulted ceilings, and walls and floors the texture of tortilla chips. When I looked closely, I could see that they were not so much rooms as places where many foraging tunnels crossed, like the grand concourses of old train stations. Deep within this area was a small capsule where the king and queen lived, making eggs, which were carried to nearby nurseries.</p><hr/><p><span><span>B</span></span><span>elow the mound lives the fungus, digesting grass. All termites use symbiotic collectives of bacteria and other microbes to digest cellulose for them, but <em>Macrotermes</em> outsource the major work to a fungus.</span></p><p>In some senses the fungus functions as a stomach, but it also has power reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz. Under the mound and around the nest sit hundreds of little rooms, each containing fungus comb. This comb is made of millions of mouthfuls of chewed dry grass, excreted as pseudofaeces and carefully assembled into a maze. The comb roughly resembles graham cracker pie crust, although it varies in colour from delicious beige to decrepit black. The termites inoculate it with a fungus that they have been cohabiting with for more than 30m years.</p><figure id="8216da2a-98e0-4bef-a90a-3f238cd56767"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=0e8bc0b05828f622db77ce49c8641c49 2040w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f686bd78809cae041cd9ac930c02d70a 1880w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=728b65578e2afa596fd838bfe81bbdc1 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=728b65578e2afa596fd838bfe81bbdc1 1400w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c5072c0ec817a61d0d10006d72b7a374 1320w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=66ab8d14acea75369fc7a0afaa059852 1290w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=b870c719cfcee7b9bc6fda3f2aebd1e6 930w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=1020&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e007a833f30232f9f0fec2b83426eb9d 1020w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=940&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2e5d7e8b75a031f7fce722dee51151c3 940w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8feedc72d4d589927ffbef09aee5b74 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8feedc72d4d589927ffbef09aee5b74 700w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=660&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=02ba6c656bc445997eff474e79c12539 660w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=645&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2c459ec3453839ff4eb1db37f58d6042 645w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60d19908d035f7bc581b8d2ec6cdeb4ebfce88f/0_116_3884_2331/master/3884.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=33cefe37133f96408710b346e1e9c3b8 465w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 860px, (min-width: 1140px) 780px, (min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Isoptera termites.</span> Photograph: Bryan Mullennix/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>You can pull the fungus combs out of their little rooms as if you were pulling drawers from a doll’s wardrobe. The comb maze wiggles like the folds of a brain, with the hard, wrinkly piles of chewed grass making the gyri and leaving sulci-ish gaps in between. This is not an accident: as with a brain, the comb design increases the surface area of the structure. Within the gaps are what look like tiny white balloons, which is the fungus blooming. There is nothing accidental about this relationship either, or the construction that holds it: the details are so fine we can barely take them in. The bottom of the fungus comb stands on peg-like legs, little nubbins that hold it up just enough to let air circulate through. One of the grad students beat a small stick against the floors of the fungus galleries, playing something that was almost a tune.</p><p>The symbiotic relationship between <em>Macrotermes</em> and the fungus is tight: workers scour the landscape for dry grass, quickly run it through their guts, then place and inoculate each ball to suit the fungus’s picky temperament, tend the comb and snarfle the fungus and its sugars before distributing the goodies to the rest of the family. Then the workers run off to gather more grass for the fungus. Termite and <em>Termitomyces</em> fungus are so interrelated that it’s hard to tell where the mushroom ends and the termite picks up, but within their codependence is a sort of frenemy-type rivalry. (Fungi are capable of deliberately tricking termites. One invasive fungus in termite colonies in the US and Japan pretends to be a termite egg, going so far as to secrete the chemical lysozyme, which the termites use to recognise their eggs. For reasons that are not clear, colonies filled with impostor “eggs” are no less healthy than those without them.)</p><p>Prejudiced by our human sense of a hierarchy of the animate termites over inanimate mushrooms, we would be inclined to believe that the termites control the fungus. But the fungus is much larger than the termites – both in size and energy production: Turner estimates that its metabolism is about eight times bigger than that of the termites in the mound. “I like to tell people that this is not a termite-built structure; it’s a fungus-built structure,” he says, chuckling. It is possible that the fungus has kidnapped the termites. It’s even possible that the fungus has put out a template of chemical smells that stimulates the termites to build the mound itself. As I peered at the white nodules, I began to sneeze violently, sometimes with big gasping whoops, and something – it’s hard to even call it a thought, but a particle of one – flitted through my subconscious before flying out of my nose: the fungus is very powerful.</p><p>My admiration for the fungus only grew when I learned that Namibian farmers estimate that every <em>Macrotermes</em> mound – which contains just 5kg of termites – eats as much dead grass as a 400kg cow. Late in the day, one of the scientists used a pickaxe to pop the royal chamber out of the nest – the whole complex was the size and shape of a squashed soccer ball, but made of hard-packed finely grained dirt. He cracked it open, revealing the king and queen in a hollow space the size of a cough-drop tin. The chamber had holes on the sides, allowing air and smaller termites to pass through. The king was large and dark compared to the workers, but the queen was huge – as big as my finger. Her legs and upper body waggled but barely budged the fluid-filled sac of her lower body, which pulsed erratically, as though she was a toothpaste tube squeezed by an unseen hand. Her skin was shiny and translucent and the fats inside her swirled like pearly cream dribbled into coffee.</p><p>Everyone shuddered: the queen is viscerally repulsive. She offends our sensibilities and she is monstrous. I think the first stimulus to shudder is a reflexive reaction to her body’s pulses and swirls. But then a more intellectual sense of her horror kicks in. “She’s not a queen; she’s a slave,” said Eugene Marais, a Namibian entomologist working with Turner (no relation to the writer of the famous work on termites). Captive of her body, of her children, of the structure of the mound she conspired to build.</p><p>Even then, the queen’s more shocking aspects are hidden from us. Her truly stupendous fertility – creating millions of eggs over as long as 20 years – is something we can only infer. Some species of termite queens can clone themselves by producing eggs with no entry-ways for sperm, which then mature into sexual queens with only their mother’s chromosomes, duplicated inside the egg nucleus, to furnish a full set. Imperfect copies of the queen, these knockoffs are good enough to get the job done. Parthenogenesis allows the queen to live, in insect years, pretty close to for ever.</p><figure id="2fb15fc6-5beb-4ce1-81ec-1b36d549a2dc"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-47 | 47" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></figure><p>And yet we do refer to her as a queen. I wondered why. Marais said that when early European naturalists looked into beehives and termite mounds, they saw the monarchies they came from – with workers, soldiers, and kings and queens. It was misleading, he said, and kept us from really understanding what was going on with termites. For scientists, the great danger of seeing social insects anthropomorphically is that it obscures their true insect-ness. In the 1970s and 80s, when the ant scientist Deborah Gordon began studying massive ant colonies in the American south-west, scientists described the ant colony as “a factory with assembly-line workers, each performing a single task over and over”. Gordon felt the factory model clouded what she actually saw in her colonies – a tremendous variation in the tasks that ants were doing. Rather than having intrinsic task assignments, she saw that ants changed their behaviour based on clues they got from the environment and one another. Gordon suggested that we should stop thinking of ants as factory workers and instead think of them as “the firing patterns of neurons in the brain”, where simple environmental information gives cues that make the individuals work for the whole, without central regulation.</p><p>And so, these days, one scientific metaphor for the inscrutable termite is a neuron in a giant crawling brain.</p><p>Back in the 1930s, the other Marais didn’t write a termite science book, but a book about how humans could understand termites – as a bug, a body, a soul, a force on the landscape. Looking at termites this way changed how I see the world, science, the future and myself.</p><p><em>This is an edited extract from Underbug: An Obsessive Tale of Termites and Technology by Lisa Margonelli (Oneworld, £16.99).

												<p><em>Human evolution favors energy conservation, but has our evolution worked against us since inactivity is linked to health risks? A new study of a modern hunter-gatherer society finds that <strong>how</strong> people rest matters.</em></p>
<p>Contact: Emily Gersema, (213) 712-3168 or [<a href="mailto:gersema@usc.edu">gersema@usc.edu</a>]</p>
<p>Standing desks are so passé. It’s time for squatting desks.</p>
<p>A USC-led study shows that squatting and kneeling may be important resting positions in human evolution — and even for modern human health.</p>
<p>Sitting for hours a day is linked to some health risks, including cardiovascular disease, likely because it involves low muscle activity and low muscle metabolism. However, these risks seem paradoxical. For humans, evolutionary pressures favor conserving energy. Spending a lot of time sitting would seem to accomplish that goal. So, why should sitting be so harmful?</p>
<p>The USC-led team has shown that resting postures used before the invention of chairs — like squatting and kneeling — may hold the answer, as they involve higher levels of muscle activity then chair-sitting. These more active rest postures may help protect people from the harmful effects of inactivity.</p>
<p>“We tend to think human physiology is adapted to the conditions in which we evolved,” said David Raichlen [https://pressroom.usc.edu/david-raichlen/], a professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “So, we assumed that if inactivity is harmful, our evolutionary history would not have included much time spent sitting the way we do today.”</p>
<p>The study was published on March 9 in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/03/1911868117" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;,&#39;outbound-article&#39;,&#39;http://www.pnas.org&#39;]);"><strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>How you rest matters</strong></p>
<p>To better understand the evolution of sedentary behaviors, the scientists studied inactivity in a group of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, the Hadza, who have a lifestyle that is similar in some ways with how humans lived in the past.</p>
<p>For the study, Hadza participants wore devices that measured physical activity and periods of rest. The scientists found that they had high levels of physical activity — over three times as much as the 22 minutes per day advised by U.S. federal health guidelines.</p>
<p>But the scientists also found that they had high levels of inactivity.</p>
<p>In fact, the Hadza are sedentary for about as much time — around 9 to 10 hours per day — as humans in more developed countries. However, they appear to lack the markers of chronic diseases that are associated, in industrialized societies, with long periods of sitting. The reason for this disconnect may lie in how they rest.</p>
<p>“Even though there were long periods of inactivity, one of the key differences we noticed is that the Hadza are often resting in postures that require their muscles to maintain light levels of activity — either in a squat or kneeling,” Raichlen said.</p>
<p>In addition to tracking activity and inactivity, the researchers used specialized equipment to measure muscle activity in the lower limbs in different resting postures. Squatting involved more muscle activity compared to sitting.</p>

<p><strong>The evolution of inactivity</strong></p>
<p>The researchers suggested that because the Hadza squat and kneel and have high levels of movement when not at rest, they may have</p>

And that may be why they don’t develop risk markers for heart and metabolic diseases. Credit: David Raichlen, USC, and Brian Wood, UCLA</em></p></div>
<p>more consistent muscle activity throughout the day. This could reduce the health risks associated with sedentary behavior.</p>
<p>“Being a couch potato — or even sitting in an office chair — requires less muscle activity than squatting or kneeling,” Raichlen said. “Since light levels of muscle activity require fuel, which generally means burning fats, then squatting and kneeling postures may not be as harmful as sitting in chairs.”</p>
<p>In developed countries, humans spend inactive periods sitting on their duffs in chairs, recliners or sofas, so the only time they activate their leg muscles is when they bend their knees to slide into the seat. On average, people in more industrialized societies, including the United States and Europe, spend about nine hours per day sitting.</p>
<p>“Preferences or behaviors that conserve energy have been key to our species’ evolutionary success,” said Brian Wood, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked with the Hazda people for 16 years. “But when environments change rapidly, these same preferences can lead to less optimal outcomes. Prolonged sitting is one example.”</p>
<p>The scientists dubbed this the “Inactivity Mismatch Hypothesis.”</p>
<p>“Replacing chair sitting and associated muscular inactivity with more sustained active rest postures may represent a behavioral paradigm that should be explored in future experimental work,” they wrote. Resolving this inactivity mismatch with our evolutionary past could pay off in better health today.</p>
<p>“Squatting is not a likely alternative,” Raichlen said, “but spending more time in postures that at least require some low-level muscle activity could be good for our health.”</p>

<p>In addition to Raichlen and Wood, other co-authors involved in the study were: Herman Pontzer of Duke University; Ted W. Zderic of University of Texas; Jacob A. Harris of Arizona State University; Audax Z. P. Mabulla of University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania; and Marc Hamilton of the University of Texas.</p>
<p>The study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, the University of Arizona Bio5 Institute and the American Diabetes Association.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>N 1960 JOHN KENNEDY</small>, the Democratic candidate for the American presidency, accused the incumbent Republican administration of having allowed a “missile gap” to open up between America and the Soviet Union. The idea seemed plausible. The Soviet Union’s success in launching the first satellite, <em>Sputnik</em>, on a rocket which could double as an intercontinental ballistic missile (<small>ICBM</small>) had naturally led to speculation that it was far ahead of America in the deployment of such weapons.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/012%20Briefing%20-%20Open-source%20intelligence-34ed53d1bb018beec33d7781324fb2f8.mp3" title="Open-source intelligence challenges state monopolies on information" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p>Plausible, but wrong. Soviet <small>ICBM</small>s could be counted on the fingers of one hand. But although, by the final days of the campaign, President Dwight Eisenhower had strong evidence of this from the <small>CORONA</small> spy-satellite programme, he could make no mention of it. The ability to spot <small>ICBM</small> sites from space was so precious that it was worth risking the White House to keep it secret.</p><p>What was then world-historic is now the stuff of student projects—albeit an exceptional project for an exceptional student. When rumours of new Chinese <small>ICBM</small> launch sites fluttered through Washington, <small>DC</small>, earlier this year, Decker Eveleth applied himself to the problem. His resources were easily sourced satellite pictures; common sense, which told him the silos would be on flat land far from American radars in Japan and South Korea; and a degree of stick-with-it-ness sufficient to the challenge of systematically examining all the empty plains of western China.</p><p>Having slogged all across Inner Mongolia without luck, he hit gold in neighbouring Gansu. There, in the Gobi desert, he could see 120 missile silos under construction, the largest such effort mounted anywhere on Earth since the end of the cold war. A month later Matt Korda, a 26-year-old researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, an <small>NGO</small>, discovered the same telltale grid pattern in a secluded part of Xinjiang.</p><p>Mr Eveleth first dabbled in the interpretation of satellite data two years ago, when he was a sophomore in college. “A class had some very boring readings,” he says, “so I opened Google Earth.” That led him to Geo4Nonpro, a crowdsourced project which let budding hobbyists and seasoned experts collaborate to annotate satellite pictures of everything from uranium mines in India to chemical-weapon facilities in Syria. “It’s fun,” says Mr Eveleth. “There’s a happy feeling you get when you look at a site and think: I’m the first person to know what that is.”</p><p>Geo4Nonpro was run by the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies (<small>CNS</small>), a part of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, California. The <small>CNS</small> is a leader in gathering and analysing open-source intelligence (<small>OSINT</small>). It has pulled off some dramatic coups with satellite pictures, including on one occasion actually catching the launch of a North Korean missile in an image (pictured above) provided by Planet, a company in San Francisco.</p><p>Satellite data, though, is only one of the resources feeding a veritable boom in non-state <small>OSINT</small>. There are websites which track all sorts of useful goings-on, including the routes taken by aircraft and ships. There are vast searchable databases. Terabytes of footage from phones are uploaded to social-media sites every day, much of it handily tagged. “On their phone people have the same quality information I used to have to go into a secure facility for,” says Bruce Klingner, who worked as an analyst for the <small>CIA</small> and the Pentagon’s Defence Intelligence Agency for 20 years. “It&#39;s just really kind of mind-boggling.”</p><p>And it is not just the data. There are also tools and techniques for working with them—3<small>D</small> modelling packages, for example, which let you work out what sort of object might be throwing the shadow you see in a picture. And there are social media and institutional settings that let this be done collaboratively. Eclectic expertise and experience can easily be leveraged with less-well-versed enthusiasm and curiosity in the service of projects which link academics, activists, journalists and people who mix the attributes of all three groups. The intelligence world is thus being democratised, a development which is challenging governments, reshaping diplomacy and chipping away at the very idea of secrecy.</p><h2>An archaeology of knowledge</h2><p>When Eliot Higgins began analysing YouTube footage of weapons used in the Syrian civil war in the early 2010s it was seen as a “weird amateur hobby”, he says. But he saw their potential. In 2014 Mr Higgins founded Bellingcat, a collective of researchers, investigators and “citizen-journalists” funded by a range of charities which now has 18 full-time employees. In its first year it cut its teeth on an investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines flight, <small>MH</small>17, over eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Local people had posted videos of a Russian missile launcher moving through the area. Mr Higgins and a band of volunteers roamed Google Earth to identify various trees, road bends and buildings visible in those videos so that they could say exactly where it had been when. <a href="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6a3f01180b03040f2a1d0b18">[email protected]</a>, an anonymous blogger, identified a specific field as the likely launch site. Photographs taken later showed the same launcher back in Russia—and missing one missile.</p><p>When a Ukraine International Airlines flight, <small>PS</small>752, crashed outside Tehran on January 8th 2020, five days after America had assassinated a leading Iranian general, Bellingcat was on the case again. So were the members of a channel on Slack, an instant-messaging and collaboration tool, called “Arms Control Wonk Podcast”: the podcast in question was founded by Jeffrey Lewis of <small>CNS</small>. The channel’s 1,000-strong membership bats around thoughts on everything from missile tests to the spread of covid-19, says Paddy Kerley, an Irish cyber-security professional who enjoys scrutinising North Korean nuclear facilities in his spare time. Others have equally esoteric interests. “There’s one guy reverse engineering a Sidewinder [missile] that he bought parts of on eBay—you know, normal things normal people do.” Membership costs $5 a month, $3 for students.</p><p>Photographs taken at the <small>PS</small>752 crash site showed the mangled parts of a rocket and damage that seemed consistent with a missile attack. Wary of misinformation, the Bellingcat team ran a search for previous uses of the same images. It came up blank, suggesting the photos were new.</p><p>A video posted anonymously to Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, showed a light streaking into the sky, a flash and a boom just prior to the crash. A series of nondescript apartment blocks and a construction site were visible in the foreground. The Slack team divided into groups to pan through freely available satellite images of Tehran looking for the same pattern. They lighted on a spot in a suburb to the west of Imam Khomeini International Airport (see illustration).</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1868/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210807_fbm933.png"/><p></p></div></figure><p>Locating that spot gave the analysts a bearing. The 11 seconds between the flash in the sky and the sound of the explosion provided a distance. According to FlightRadar24, a website which displays the transponder signals of aircraft, the location thus calculated sat on the flight path of <small>PS</small>752. It had been downed by a surface-to-air missile launched from nearby.</p><p>The next day Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that “intelligence from multiple sources” showed that the plane had been brought down by Iran&#39;s own air defences. Such accusations were “psychological warfare against Iran”, thundered an Iranian spokesman. But the evidence of what had actually happened continued to accumulate, thanks both to government briefings (the sorry chain of events had been captured by American spy satellites; the mobile-phone conversations of panicked revolutionary guards had been intercepted) and to the people using <small>OSINT</small> techniques. On January 11th Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, publicly acknowledged that a “disastrous mistake” had been made.</p><p>As in the case of <small>MH</small>17, the <small>OSINT</small> efforts were not the last word. But on both occasions the open availability of evidence gathered from diverse sources and analysed independently was incriminating in a way that <em>parti-pris</em> pronouncements from intelligence agencies would not have been on their own.</p><h2>The order of things</h2><p>In reacting to events such as the downing of aircraft, the <small>OSINT</small> community typically relies on data that are already out there. For other projects it acquires new data it expects to have use for—often from space. The capabilities that <small>CORONA</small> provided in the 1960s are now handily outstripped by a bevy of commercial satellite operators (see chart). Planet has been launching cameras on tiny “cubesats” since 2013 and now has a constellation of about 150 with which it aims to photograph all of the Earth’s land surface every day. Its cheaper images have a resolution of three metres per pixel, picking out objects the size of a car; its sharper ones are 50cm per pixel, showing more detail. Companies like Maxar, a maker of bigger American satellites, and Airbus, a European aerospace giant, provide higher-resolution images.</p><div><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210807_FBC149.png"/><p></p></div></figure><p>When, in the 1990s, the American government sought to encourage the development of such ventures, it imagined controls over the high-resolution stuff. That policy foundered when companies elsewhere began to sell high-resolution images on the open market; better that American companies be able to compete than that they go under. Though “shutter control” by the American government remains possible, the law it rests on is not used. Subtler suasion may be at play, though. Dr Lewis has the impression that some at the Pentagon have been less than pleased with some of the images published by his team; when the government is a big customer, such anger could matter to the revenue of the companies involved.</p><p>The government is a big customer because the commercial images provide a useful supplement to its classified in-house capabilities. They also provide a rhetorical resource: pictures bought commercially can be used publicly without revealing anything about classified capabilities. “We are providing a particular role in society that most open countries, including the United States, net benefit from,” says Will Marshall, the <small>CEO</small> of Planet. “It might occasionally expose something inconvenient for them, but that’s the new state of the world.”</p></div><h2>You can look</h2><p>If government is the biggest consumer, though, Dr Lewis may be the keenest. He and his colleagues have used data from Planet, Maxar, Airbus and others to analyse missile programmes in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. The evidence base they have built to further their work on non-proliferation has earned them an impressive reputation for unearthing missile launchers, rocket factories and nuclear plants.</p><p>“Overhead” imagery, as it is known, is not magic; it needs interpretation, and that means knowing what you are looking for. A haunting lesson comes from a second-world-war reconnaissance mission. In 1944 a plane sent to photograph a chemicals plant in northern Poland which the allies planned to bomb turned its cameras on early and captured images of a large industrial complex nearby. It was only three decades later that Dino Brugioni and Robert Poirier, a pair of <small>CIA</small> analysts working in their spare time, pointed out that those early frames were the first aerial images ever taken of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps.</p><p>Further flights took pictures of the roof vents where Zyklon-B crystals were inserted into the gas chambers; of long, snaking lines of prisoners; of smoke billowing from the pits behind Birkenau’s crematorium. None were recognised for what they were. “There simply was no historical or intelligence precedence [sic] for genocide on such a scale,” wrote Mr Brugioni in an essay in 1983. “Most World War II interpreters I have spoken to found the concept unbelievable, unimaginable, and completely incongruous.” Other intelligence officers had more sense of what was going on; but they did not know about the photos, and the interpreters did not know to ask them.</p><p>Today’s <small>OSINT</small> community does not suffer from such compartmentalisation, and it has sources on the ground from which it can learn more about structures seen from the sky. In 2017 reports of “counter-extremism” and “political education” camps built by China to detain Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, a western province, began circulating in local and foreign media outlets. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (<small>ASPI</small>), a think-tank, gathered this evidence in a single database, supplemented it with photographs shared on Chinese social media and started looking at satellite images for structures which fitted the bill. They identified 28.</p><p>China unwittingly made adding to the tally easy. In August 2018 journalists at <em>BuzzFeed News</em> noticed that Baidu Maps, a Chinese app, was systematically blotting out some places in Xinjiang. A number of the blots covered camps found by <small>ASPI</small>. Searching Baidu Maps for the easy-to-see blots and then looking at uncensored satellite data of the same spots revealed a gulag archipelago of several hundred more camps, most of them previously unknown.</p><p>Had China built such a machinery of repression three decades ago, stories from inmates and their relatives would doubtless have trickled out. America would have seen the facilities involved with its spy satellites, had it looked, and might have vouched for their existence. But the digital record furnishes evidence that is publicly accessible and visually compelling; nothing has done more to make the oppression of the Uyghurs international news.</p><p>Ever better hardware for phones, a technological trend which can be relied on, means ever better hardware for satellites. Planet’s cubesats are now far more capable than those it launched in 2013. Other companies are pioneering new forms of satellite observation. Capella, Ice-Eye, Umbra and Xpress-<small>SAR</small> are radar-satellite startups offering “synthetic aperture” technology which can take detailed pictures of surface features even through clouds, foliage and, sometimes, thin roofs. (It can also provide entirely unexpected insights. In 2018 Harel Dan, an analyst at a company in Israel, showed that the powerful radars used by American Patriot missile batteries interfered with the operations of a European radar satellite, Sentinel-1, thereby revealing hitherto unknown air-defence sites.)</p><p>Hyperspectral sensors, capable of making fine distinctions in the analysis of light beyond the visible blue, green and red bands, reveal things as diverse as wakes in turbid water, the health of crops or the difference between new and old paintwork. They may also show things which, wavelength-restricted as their own eyes are, human interpreters have yet to imagine. It is in part to guard against missing such things that satellite images are increasingly fed into machine-learning software which will see patterns humans might not pick out, or even think to look for.</p><p>This is not all being done for the benefit of spooks and their civilian <small>OSINT</small> counterparts. Seeing the world in detail and watching it change over time has all sorts of applications for agriculture, for investors, for commodity companies, for environmental monitoring of corporate activities and more. But <small>OSINT</small> is a happy fellow traveller.</p><h2>But you better not touch</h2><p>The infovorous energy and ecumenical spirit of online <small>OSINT</small> are not unprecedented. The men and women who staffed the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, America’s wartime proto-<small>OSINT</small> organisation, were “the greatest collection of individualists, international rolling stones, and slightly batty geniuses ever gathered together in one organisation”, remarked a journalist who visited their Washington office in 1943, a “unique combination of newspapermen and <small>P</small>h<small>D</small>s” consumed by “casual kidding in 17 foreign languages [and] the feeling that something big may come over at any minute”.</p><p>The same buzz is now replicated in online chats and Slack channels. To locate a tent from a scrap of road marker glimpsed through a gap in the canvas wins kudos. What other high jinks can compare with using Denis Rodman, a basketball player, to measure the size of an <small>H</small>-bomb? Photographs of Mr Rodman standing with Kim Jong Un allow a reliable estimate of the North Korean dictator’s height (it would be foolish to trust official statistics on such a matter). From Mr Kim’s height you can estimate the size of his head; from that you can get the size of nuclear weapons with which he has posed.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210807_fbp510.jpg"/><p></p></div><figcaption>Mr Kim and his bomb (Dennis Rodman included for scale)</figcaption></figure><p>The techniques of <small>OSINT</small> are not only applicable in closed states and war zones. In 1978 William Arkin, who had until recently been an intelligence analyst tracking Soviet nuclear forces in East Germany for the American army, tried to work out where their <small>NATO</small> equivalents in the West were. He found what seemed to be telltale terms used in unclassified descriptions of some military units and found the addresses of the bases they were stationed at. In the antediluvian days before Google Earth he travelled round Germany looking at the sites thus identified. They turned out all to have a distinct double-fence security set-up and identical guard towers, measures which confirmed the presence of something particularly dangerous and worth protecting.</p><p>When Mr Arkin’s findings were published in 1981 America accused him of having used classified information from his army days. To avoid criminal charges he had to prove the information was all in the public domain. In a new book, “Restricted Data”, Alex Wellerstein, a historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology, describes the proceedings: “A colonel shouted the names of bases, and Arkin would then display the tangled web of documents proving that each base contained nuclear weapons.” As they ran through base after base, the colonel “slumped deeper and deeper into his seat”. Mr Arkin walked free.</p><p>Some may sympathise with the colonel. If <small>OSINT</small> makes keeping military secrets harder it may give comfort to enemies. “We often get complaints from professional photo interpreters, that they don’t like seeing their method described so explicitly in public”, says Dr Lewis, “because they think it might help the adversary.”</p><p>Many of his colleagues are acutely aware of these risks. Melissa Hanham of Stanford University says that when her <small>OSINT</small> work led her to a theory of why North Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles were failing she decided that it would be wrong to publish it, lest it help the missileers. She is working with various <small>OSINT</small> organisations to develop a code of conduct for open-source researchers faced with such ethical quandaries.</p><p>The room for improvement that can be revealed by <small>OSINT</small> is not just in dictatorships. In early 2018 Nathan Ruser, then a student and now an analyst at <small>ASPI</small>, got interested in the data made publicly available by Strava, an app that allows users to log exercise routines. It showed joggers looping around New York’s Central Park, cyclists streaming down Shanghai’s Bund and swimmers thronging Bondi Beach. It also showed lonelier fitness regimes being pursued in various hotspots around the world, thus revealing what turned out to be <small>CIA</small> bases in Somalia and Djibouti and a Patriot missile battery in Yemen. Was this embarrassing? Yes. Is it likely to lead to better security in future? Again, yes.</p><p>If security services can benefit from <small>OSINT</small>, can they also use it to their own ends? When Bellingcat identified the two Russian agents who had poisoned Sergei Skripal, a Russian spy living in the English city of Salisbury, the Kremlin was apoplectic. “Bellingcat is closely connected with the intelligence services,” fumed Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, “which uses it to channel information intended to influence public opinion.”</p><p>If such accusations were to stick, the organisation would be weakened. It is to give the lie to them that Bellingcat meticulously documents the databases it draws on, the methods it uses and the crosschecks by which it validates things. To plant a falsehood that passed muster would mean starting a paper trail years before: not impossible, but hard to do on the fly. And hard to get away with, too, in an open community full of frenemies eager to probe each other’s conclusions.</p><h2>Why didn’t you tell the world?</h2><p>The most general challenge posed by <small>OSINT</small> is the weakening of a certain sort of state power. Dr Wellerstein argues that treating secrecy as simply denying people information misses something crucial. “It&#39;s about the control of the information. It&#39;s about the ability to dole it out as you see fit to get your ends…and governments have always known this.” Dr Lewis was originally attracted to <small>OSINT</small> in the early 2000s by his frustration during the run-up to the Iraq war. He felt that civil society had no way to check dubious claims being made on the basis of intelligence released through choreographed public statements and secret briefings to news organisations. Now, to an increasing extent, it does.</p><p>In undermining state monopolies on intelligence, <small>OSINT</small> is increasingly capable of challenging the narratives states promulgate. The <small>CNS</small> and other <small>OSINT</small> groups, for example, have consistently provided a sense of North Korea’s nuclear abilities more realistic than that offered by recent American administrations, which repeatedly claimed they would not allow North Korea to develop capabilities which, judging by the <small>OSINT</small> evidence, it already had.</p><p>If revealing inconvenient truths undermines policies based on ignoring the facts, though, it is not necessarily a road to peace. A country given a bloody nose in a border skirmish might be less inclined to back down if its citizens are shown evidence of its failure. Secrecy enables face-saving, and thus de-escalation.</p><p>Consider the resolution of the Cuba crisis in 1962. The removal of Soviet nuclear weapons from the island was achieved through a deal which also saw America remove its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. This quid pro quo was kept secret for decades; Kennedy even lied about it to former presidents. “Any other course”, his aides later wrote, “would have had explosive and destructive effects on the security of the United States and its allies.” Secrecy enables malfeasance, perhaps, but it can also serve as a lubricant. In an age of <small>OSINT</small> the withdrawal of the Jupiters would quickly have become common knowledge.</p><p>But would the quid pro quo have been necessary at all in such an age? Cuba was a crisis because the missiles were already there when America first became aware of the situation. Today, one imagines, it would have been on the ball a lot earlier. And if, for some reason, it had missed what was under its nose, driven, chatty and motivated satellite-data wonks would have delighted in telling the government, the press or Twitter what was what. A reduced capacity for subterfuge may, in some cases, be a genuine loss. A lessened risk of strategic surprise is a real benefit. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline &#34;Trainspotting, with nukes&#34;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>Any museum can get a telescope and point it to the stars, but few can bring the wonders of the galaxy down to Earth. The new Shanghai Astronomy Museum, which recently opened in China, is potentially the world’s most majestic museum devoted to the skies. This elliptical, silvery structure looks part spaceship, part planetary invasion, with angular shapes that “embody some of the fundamental laws of astrophysics,” says the museum’s designer, Thomas J. Wong, a design partner at <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.ennead.com/work/shanghai-astronomy-museum&#34;}" href="http://www.ennead.com/work/shanghai-astronomy-museum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ennead Architects</a>.</p><p>The largest museum devoted to the art of astronomy, this 420,000-square-foot masterpiece is a new branch of the <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.sstm.org.cn/&#34;}" href="http://www.sstm.org.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shanghai Science and Technology Museum</a>, which has landed upon a green swath of land alongside the nearby Maritime Museum and a new astronomy-themed public park, which will soon be completed.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>Measuring some 420,000 square feet, this is the world’s largest museum devoted to astronomy.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>That sci-fi wow factor was no accident. “The big idea was to infuse a visceral experience of astronomy into the design and deliver that before you even enter the building,” Wong says. “The building itself is conceived as an ‘astronomical instrument’ that coordinates with the path of the Sun across a day, and the changing solar altitude in our sky through the seasons.”</p><p>Ennead won the 2014 design competition to create the Astronomy Museum as a building that echoes the geometry of the universe. They previously designed the rotund, planetary-like <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/rose-center&#34;}" href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/rose-center" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rose Center for Earth and Space</a> at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In Shanghai, one of the museum’s main highlights includes the Oculus. Suspended above the main entrance, this round design detail tracks time by sunlight throughout the day, calling back to 14th century sundials.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>A view inside of the brand-new museum, located in Shanghai.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>“At noon, the figure of light is most complete during any single day,” Wong says. “When the Sun is highest in the sky during summer solstice, a full and pure circle of light aligns with an inscribed circle on the plaza’s pavement.”</p><p>Science and the stars were the inspiration for the design, which focuses on the most crucial of all orbital movements, explains Wong: “The daily rotation of our Earth and its journey around our star.”</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>A look at one of the many exhibitions inside the museum.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another one of the museum’s highlights is the Sphere, which looks like an enormous planet that has dropped into the core of the museum. It almost touches the ground (but not quite). This silver metallic sphere, punctured with circles, is home to a planetarium theater that tracks the Sun, Moon, and the stars. Its overwhelming size ties into Wong’s favorite Carl Sagan quote: “Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.”</p><p>The last and final feature along museumgoers’ way is the Inverted Dome, which is high up on the museum’s rooftop. The roof allows an unfettered view of the sky, with glass panels that look downward into the museum, offering a pause between the macro and the micro.</p><figure><figcaption><span><p>With ample space, the museum allows for stunningly lifelike exhibition experiences.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all, Wong wanted to take us elsewhere, beyond the beyond. “We wanted to highlight actual astronomical phenomena that have occurred here on Earth—things that have become more removed from our consciousness, particularly in modern urban life,” he says.</p><p>They also wanted to avoid predictable, clean lines. “We wanted the architecture to reflect the essence of the universe,” Wong says. “There are no straight lines or right angles in space.”</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The relentlessness of chronic pain wears you down. Beyond being a physical distraction in and of itself, it disrupts sleep, <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/when-someone-on-your-team-has-chronic-pain">interferes with work</a> and relationships, and can even alter the way we process emotions by causing <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-pain-disrupts-our-emotions-right-down-on-a-chemical-level">physiological changes in our brains</a>.</p>
<p>But the experience of long-term pain is complicated and varies between individuals, making it difficult to explain and quantify, let alone diagnose and manage.</p><p>Now, in a large study of over 21,500 people who visited the University of Pittsburgh&#39;s severe pain management clinics, perioperative specialist Benedict Alter and colleagues have developed a new method to try to help work this out.</p><p>&#34;We found that how a patient reports the bodily distribution of their chronic pain affects nearly all aspects of the pain experience, including what happens three months later,&#34; the team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">wrote in their paper</a>.</p><p>Using a computer clustering analysis of patient body pain maps and pain assessments, the researchers discovered that patients fit into nine groups of chronic pain, as defined in the image below.</p><p>What&#39;s more, these patterns of pain distribution could predict pain intensity, pain quality, pain impact, physical function, mood, sleep and indicate likely patient outcomes.</p><p><span><span>(Alter et al., PLOS One, 2021)</span></span></p><p><em>Above: B<span>ody pain maps for each of the nine identified chronic pain clusters, with colored heat scale indicating frequency of pain.</span></em></p><p>For example, while the group of patients experiencing lower back pain radiating below the knee (group F) had worse physical function difficulties than those experiencing neck and shoulder pain (E) or neck, shoulder and lower back pain (G), these patients reported less anxiety, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" target="_blank" title="depression">depression</a>, and sleep disturbance than the other two groups.</p><p>A subset of over 7,000 patients completed a follow-up questionnaire, three months after filling out the initial body pain map and questionnaire. Patients experiencing abdominal pain (group B) showed the most progress, with almost half reporting significant improvement.</p><p>Those with neck, shoulder and lower back pain (group G), however, demonstrated the worst outcomes on follow-up, with only 37 percent reporting improvements. This group shared characteristics with the two widespread pain groups, causing the team to ponder if this subgroup may be an early stage in developing generalized, widespread chronic pain. The researchers recommend a long term study to monitor pain duration and stability over time within this group.</p><p>What&#39;s more, their findings that the more widespread the pain, the more persistent it is, are consistent with a<a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recent MRI study</a> in fibromyalgia patients that found the more widespread reported pain is on body maps, the more changes observed in brain connectivity around the pain-processing parts of the brain.</p><p>&#34;A case can be made that reports of widespread pain collected with digital pain body maps are diagnostic of pathophysiological changes in pain processing,&#34; Alter and team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">suggest</a>.</p><p>This ability for body pain maps to indicate likely patient outcomes could help identify patients at risk of poor outcomes even from their first pain clinic visit.</p><p><span><span>(Alter et al., PLOS One, 2021)</span></span></p><p><em>Above: </em><i>each row on the vertical axis represents an individual patient out of the entire cohort (N = 21,658 unique patients) organized by pain body map cluster membership.</i></p><p>With up to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15585%2Fmmwr.mm6736a2">40 percent of adults</a> in the US currently experiencing chronic pain - which is likely to increase with the potential <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001950">impacts of long term COVID-19</a> - diagnostic tools such as this could make a massive difference in many people&#39;s lives.</p><p>There&#39;s still a lot of work to do to untangle all these relationships, and the researchers caution that this is an observational study so they cannot establish causation.</p><p>&#34;Outcome data do not address specific therapies, and therefore, it remains unclear which specific treatment may be helpful for a particular body map cluster,&#34; they <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/large-body-map-study-suggests-chronic-pain-comes-in-9-distinct-types?nc">wrote</a>.</p><p>However, Alter and team believe their study supports the idea that chronic pain is a disease process and these aspects of how its physical distribution manifests <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/923834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be</a> &#34;important for future developments in diagnosis and personalized pain management&#34;.</p><p>This research was published in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254862">PLOS One</a></em>.</p> </div>

on the world’s biggest emitters to ramp up efforts at decarbonising the global economy at the UN’s <a

to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and push for efforts to hold it to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Amid mounting pressure from allies across Europe and the US to commit to net zero by 2050, the Morrison government is expected to seize on the IPCC’s findings as a call for more immediate action using technologies such as carbon capture, “blue” hydrogen and energy

come after an <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/labor-selectively-opposed-to-new-attempt-to-broaden-arena-s-remit-20210802-p58eyt">attempt failed late on Wednesday by Labor</a> to block

widely predict that once annual average global temperatures rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, the world will see a surge in climactic tipping points, resulting in larger and

way towards reaching the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.</p><p>According to the World Meteorological Organisation, the average temperature will be at least 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels over each of the next five years, with a range of between 0.9 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Despite the efforts of many developed countries, global greenhouse emissions have risen more than 45 per cent between 2000 and 2019, with the Paris Agreement allowing most developing countries to continue increasing emissions until 2030.</p><p>Experts and Western leaders warn that keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold alive means pushing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil to reduce emissions before the end of this decade, a massive challenge that could ultimately derail the Glasgow talks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Feelings at the Fall of the Republic, Ancient and Medieval Living Standards</title>
      <link>https://acoup.blog/2021/08/06/referenda-ad-senatum-august-6-2021-feelings-at-the-fall-of-the-republic-ancient-and-medieval-living-standards-and-zombies/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Welcome!  This is going to be the first of a new sort of post we’ll do from time to time where I answer a number of shorter questions posed by my patrons over at Patreon who are at the <em>Patres et Matres Conscripti</em> tier, which entitles them to a seat in the <em>ACOUP</em> Senate (which is apparently more like the imperial senate, given that it has a strict wealth requirement).  Questions that get posed for these posts which end up being too long and complex will go back to the <em>ACOUP</em> Senate for a vote to determine which topics get full posts dedicated to them.</p>



<p>As for the title of this post type, in Latin the phrase <em>referre ad senatum</em> (‘to refer to the Senate’) meant that a magistrate would convene the senate and pose a question for debate (the final decision of the Senate in such debates, expressed as an up-or-down vote on a proposal, was called a <em>senatus consultum</em> or ‘the advice of the Senate;’ such advice was, in the Republic, non-binding – it was <em>not</em> a law – but nearly always followed).  So these posts are <em>Referenda ad senatum</em>, ‘things which must be referred to the Senate’ (Latin can be a wonderfully compact language sometimes).</p>



<p>I do want to note at the outset that the answers to these questions aren’t quite the same as a planned and researched blog post; these are mostly off-the-cuff responses and should be taken as such.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux">@BretDevereaux</a>) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<figure><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate#/media/File:Cicer%C3%B3n_denuncia_a_Catilina,_por_Cesare_Maccari.jpg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate#/media/File:Cicer%C3%B3n_denuncia_a_Catilina,_por_Cesare_Maccari.jpg">Via Wikipedia</a>, Cicero Denounces Catiline, by Cesare Maccari.  This isn’t an accurate layout of the Roman curia Hostilia (the Senate house where the speech in question would have been delivered), which was rectangular in form and would have been a lot more cramped than this.  Nevertheless, as it is probably the most famous depiction of the Roman Senate, it seemed a worthwhile title card.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Q: Vitali asks: <strong>How did the Romans feel about the crumbling of the Republic and the emergence of the Empire?  Did people in the provinces notice?  What about people in Rome?</strong></p>



<p>A: Note of course that we are talking about the collapse of the <em>republic</em> (so the first century BC) not the collapse of the <em>empire</em> (in the fifth eentury AD).</p>



<p>The Romans themselves had a lot of thoughts about the collapse of the republic.  First, we should note that they were <em>aware</em> that something was going very wrong and we have a fair bit of evidence that at least some Romans were trying to figure out how to fix it.  Sulla’s reforms (enforced at the point of a much-used sword) in 82-80 BC were an effort to fix what he saw as the progressive destabilization of the the republic going back to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus (133).  Sulla’s solutions were hamfisted though – he assumed that if he annihilated the opposing faction, crippled the tribunate and strengthened the Senate that this would resolve all of the problems.  Cicero likewise considered reforms during the 50s BCE which come out in his <em>De re publica</em> and <em>De legibus.</em>  The 50s were a time of political turmult in Rome while at the same time the last years of the decade must have been loomed over by the knowledge of an impending crisis to come in 49.  Cicero was never in a position to enact his idealized republic.</p>



<p>Overall the various Romans who contemplated reform were in a way hindered by the tendency of Roman elites to think in terms of the virtue of individuals rather than the tendency of systems.  You can see this very clearly in the writings of Sallust – another Roman writing with considerable concern as the republic comes apart – who places the fault on the collapse of Roman morals rather than on any systemic problem.</p>



<p>We also get a sense of these feelings from the literature that emerges after Augustus takes power in 31, and here there is a lot of complexity.  There is quite a lot of praise for Augustus of course – it would have been <em>profoundly</em> unwise to do otherwise – but also quite a lot of deep discomfort with the recent past, revealed in places like Livy’s deeply morally compromised legends of the founding of Rome or the sharp moral ambiguity in the final books of Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em>.  On the other hand, some of the praise for Augustus seems to have been genuine.  There was clearly an awful lot of <em>exhaustion</em> after so many years of disruption and civil war and so a general openness to Augustus’ ‘restored republic.’   Still, some Romans were clearly bothered by the collapse of the republic even much later; Lucan’s <em>Pharsalia</em> (65 AD) casts Pompey and Cato as heroes and views Caesar far more grimly.</p>



<p>We have less evidence for feeling in the provinces, but of course for many provincials, little would have changed.  Few of Augustus’ changes would have done much to change  much for people living in the provinces, whose taxes, laws and lives remained the same.  They were clearly aware of what was going on and among the elite there was clearly a scramble to try to get on the right side of whoever was going to win; being on the <em>wrong</em> side of the eventual winner could be a very dangerous place to be.  But for most regular provincials, the collapse of the Roman Republic only mattered if some rogue Roman general’s army happened to march through their part of the world.</p>



<p>Q: Dillon asks: <strong>How did living standards and technology compare between Rome and later medieval Europe?</strong></p>



<p>A: This is a frequent question and obviously a full response would require several books to write, but I think I can briefly chart some outlines of what an answer would look like.</p>



<p>The first crucial question here is exactly when in the Middle Ages one means.  There is a tendency to essentialize the European Middle Ages, often suggesting that the <em>entire</em> period reflected a regression from antiquity, but the medieval period is very long, stretching about a thousand years (c. 500 to c. 1500 AD).  There is also the question of <em>where</em> one means; the trajectory of the eastern Mediterranean is much different than the western Mediterranean.  I am going to assume we really mean western Europe.</p>



<p>While I am convinced that the evidence suggests there <em>was</em> a drop in living standards and some loss of technology in the <em>immediate </em>aftermath of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, most of that drop was fairly short-lived.  But exactly when development in medieval Europe meets and then exceeds the same for antiquity (typically we’re comparing the second century height of the Roman Empire) also depends on exactly what <em>kind</em> of measure is being used.</p>



<p>If the question, for instance, is agricultural productivity on a <em>per capita</em> basis (the most important component of per capita economic production), medieval Europe probably moves ahead of the Roman Empire fairly quickly with the introduction of better types of plow and widespread use of watermills for grinding grain.  My understanding is that by c. 1000AD, watermills show up fairly frequently in things like monastic charters, suggesting they were reasonably widespread (the Romans used watermills too, though their spread was uneven) and by that point, plow technology had also moved forward, mostly through the development of plow types better suited to Europe’s climate.  So as best we can tell, the farmer of c. 1000 AD had better tools than his Roman predecessors and probably had such for some time.</p>



<p>If the question is technology and engineering, once again what you see depends on where you look.  Some technologies don’t appear to have regressed much, if at all, ironworking being one example where it seems like little to nothing was lost.  On the other hand, in <em>western</em> Europe, the retreat in architecture is really marked and it is hard to say when you would judge the new innovations (like flying buttresses) to have equaled some of the lost ones (like concrete); certainly the great 12th/13th century Cathedrals (e.g. Notre Dame, the Duomo di Sienna and I <em>suppose</em> the lesser Duomo di Firenze, if we must include it) seem to me to have matched or exceeded all but perhaps the biggest Roman architectural projects.  Though we have to pause here because in many cases the issue was less architectural know-how (though that was a factor) as state capacity: the smaller and more fragmented states of the European Middle Ages didn’t have the resources the Roman Empire did.</p>



<p>If one instead looks for urbanization and population as the measure of development, the Middle Ages looks rather worse.  First and Second century Rome is probably unmatched in Europe until the very late 1700s, early 1800s, when first London (c. 1800) and Paris (c. 1835) reach a million.  So one looking for matches for the large cities and magnificent municipal infrastructure of the Romans will have rather a long wait.  Overall population is much more favorable as a measurement to the Middle Ages.  France probably exceeds its highest Roman population (c. 9m) by or shortly after 1000AD, Italy (c. 7.5m) by probably 1200; Spain is the odd one out, with Roman Hispania (est. 7.5m) probably only matched in the early modern period.  So for most of the Middle Ages you are looking at a larger population, but also a more rural one.  That’s not necessarily bad though; pre-modern cities were hazardous places due to sanitation and disease; such cities had a markedly higher mortality, for instance.  On the flip-side, fewer, smaller cities means less economic specialization.</p>



<p>So one’s answer often depends very much on what one values most.  For my own part, I’d say by 1000 or 1100 we can very safely say the ‘recovery’ phase of the Middle Ages is clearly over (and I think you could make an argument for setting this point substantially earlier but not meaningfully later), though even this is somewhat deceptive because it implies that no new technological ground was being broken before then, which is not true.  But the popular conception that the <em>whole</em> of the Middle Ages reflects a retreat from the standards of antiquity is to be discarded.</p>



<p>Q: Casey Larkin asks: <strong>When did you know that you wanted to study history as a career?  Was there a specific event or have you always been interested in it?</strong></p>



<p>A: History has always been something I’ve been interested in.  I am one of those rare creatures who entered college majored in exactly the degree I walked out of the door with.  The only major question I had was what sort of history I wanted to study, though the draw to Rome was always very strong (I had taken Latin in high school).  When I was very young I was mostly drawn to the flashy parts of history – battles, kings, etc.  As I got into college, I found myself drawn into what I’d describe as ‘imperial dynamics’ – investigating the extremely complex structures of very large states and the ways those structures shaped the lives of people who lived in those states (often for the worse).  I took a wide range of coursework trying to figure out exactly which mega-state I wanted to specialize in, but Rome spoke to me the most.</p>



<p>In particular, from that question, Rome suggested itself because it is far more often held up as a model of ‘success’ on those terms – in expansion, encouraging provincial buy-in, improving quality of life, etc.  The actual Rome doesn’t quite live up to that rose-tinted hype (it was, after all, an exploitative tributary empire), but it comes a lot closer than most historical empires.  It is, after all, very rare for an empire to <em>fall</em> and then have its former exploited subjects spend the better part of a millennia at least trying to reinvent it.  That said, that very process of trying to mobilize the memory of Rome in support of new imperial projects is part of what leads to the excessively rosey reputation Rome enjoys.</p>



<p>I should note I do have a post planned discussing what graduate school and getting a Ph.D in history is like, so I won’t steal my own thunder there.  I will say that, while I’ve always been interested in history, actually delving into the work of history itself has changed around my interests a fair bit.  Often it seems to me many history ‘buffs’ want to relive or <em>experience</em> history and certainly as a kid that was me, but at some point that impulse only gets one so far (because, after all, you can’t <em>actually</em> relive a historical moment) and one begins to seek to <em>understand</em> history rather than experience it vicariously.  That shift fundamentally changes the kinds of questions you ask and the evidence you look at.</p>



<p>Q: Adam Haun asks: <strong>Zombie Apocalypse!  How would ‘zombie tactics’ work against a <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/" data-type="post" data-id="2600">modern-system</a> army with NBC (Nuclear, biological, chemical protection) suits.  What about logistics issues?</strong></p>



<p>A: This is in a way a bit of a trick question.  The core components of the <em>modern system</em> – cover and concealment, maneuver offensives, and the acceleration of operational tempo beyond the opponent’s ability to adapt – none of these are really applicable to a war against mostly unthinking enemies who employ only melee combat and don’t have morale or coordination to speak of.  So a lot of the operational art behind the modern system wouldn’t be applicable.  But the <em>tools</em> and <em>training</em> developed to make the modern system work, it seems to me, probably would.  The whole reason the modern system emerged was because it became clear that no amount of concentration or <em>élan</em> could actually achieve offensive breakthrough against modern firepower.</p>



<p>That said, first we need to concede that it is certainly possible to craft a fictional zombie apocalypse so severe that this doesn’t matter.  If your zombie apocalypse is the result of an airborne pathogen which is lethal in 99.99% of cases well then nothing much here is going to matter.  But at that point, I should also note that the <em>zombies</em> are entirely incidental to the pathogen in terms of causing destruction.  So here I am going to assume the classic forms of zombie transmission: either by bite or by the dead reanimating on death.  If that’s the transmission method, I am actually very confident in a modern military’s ability to contain a zombie outbreak.</p>



<p>First, we want to dispense with ‘the soldiers fire uselessly, not realizing they need to hit the zombies in the head’ issue.  Modern rifle bullets move very fast and deliver lots of energy; they do not punch a neat hole in a target, but instead create a brief, much larger cavity produced by the transfer of kinetic energy, which stretches and damages tissue around the point of impact.  While zombies may lack vital organs and might not be able to bleed out, they do rely on the basic physics of muscles and bones in order to move.  I suspect the world’s armies would discover fairly rapidly where they needed to shot to actually disable a zombie target, but in the meantime, concentrated rifle fire is likely to work on isolated zombies, particularly since zombies cannot regenerate damages tissue.  It does no matter that zombies feel no pain: if their leg or arm is shot off, or their spine shattered, or their muscle-tissue is reduced to goo, being able to move is a question of physics, not determination.  Moreover, because these bullets are moving fast with a lot of energy, striking an unarmored human target (that is, a zombie) is not going to stop them; clustering lots of zombies up will mean bullets or bullet-fragments exiting the first zombie and striking the next.  And the next.  Barbed wire would also be effective; we’ll actually talk about this in a few weeks, but a zombie whose clothing or skin is caught on the wire would be every bit as stuck as a human, giving abundant time to be shot, stabbed, etc.</p>



<p>For large groups of zombies, I think the issue here is that Hollywood and popular culture often don’t have a clear grasp on how lethal modern high explosive munitions are.  A grenade goes off in a movie and it kills the two guys in the physical dust-cloud of the effect; an actual grenade, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M67_grenade" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M67_grenade">like the M67 fragmentation grenade</a> is lethal in a radius of 5 meters and can produce grievous (and also potentially lethal) injuries out to 15 meters and beyond.  Something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-27_Paveway_III" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-27_Paveway_III">2000lbs Paveway III (GBU-27)</a> is supposed to be lethal in excess of 350 meters radius around the point of impact.  Now we’ve discussed before how concealed or entrenched positions can evade or endure that fire, but zombies don’t dig in – a crowd of zombies moving down a road or over a field is <em>exceptionally</em> vulnerable to that kind of firepower.  Again, you don’t need to ‘aim for the head’ if your bomb shreds <em>everything</em> within two hundred yards.  I am put in mind here of the ‘ineffective’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System">M270 MLRS</a> barrage at the <a href="https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yonkers#Equipment" data-type="URL" data-id="https://zombie.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yonkers#Equipment">‘Battle of Yonkers</a>‘ in <em>World War Z</em> where the rockets are ineffective because the zombies are tightly packed; the <em>actual</em> M270 MLRS fires the M26 rocket (twelve of them) each of which deploys something like 600 (I’ve seen different numbers) cluster-bomblets, each with about the anti-personnel capability of a hand-grenade and enough punch to beat up to 4 inches of armor.  There is no amount of ‘tight packing’ which is going to make that not cause head injuries to (zombie) infantry caught in the open.  Bone and tissue isn’t a meaningful obstacle to the shrapnel created by those cluster-munitions, so packing in the zombies just increases the lethality of the strike.  And let’s keep in mind just how long even ‘fast’ zombies would be under artillery fire; the M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzer has a range of 13 miles.  Assuming our zombies run at around average human sprinting speed (most athletes can sprint around 15mph) and they maintain it continuously (a thing humans cannot do) they’re still under fire for an hour.  And also being handily outpaced by the cars following the speed limit in the right hand lane.</p>



<p>Zombie fiction over covers over this by making the zombies tremendously, inexhaustibly numerous, but again, assuming we’re working on the traditional bite-infection model, the humans merely need to achieve a modestly favorable casualty ratio in order to run the zombies out of zombies.  And I think achieving that sort of a ratio wouldn’t actually be an enormous challenge.  By and large, combatants with automatic weapons tend to have a considerable edge on combatants reduced to clawing and biting (two methods of attack regularly thwarted by <em>clothing</em>).  We haven’t even gotten to things like the use of armor (by which I mean vehicles) – a tank, with the crew buttoned up, doesn’t even need to shoot to be effective, because a 50+ ton armored object moving at 30mph is weapon enough (the top road speed of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams">M1A2 is 42mph</a>, so you are faster than zombie Usain Bolt).  Taking the ‘Battle of Yonkers’ example again, the entire fight could have been won by simply driving the tanks up and down the highway (RIP the highway, but also the zombies).  Tanks have awful gas mileage, but they have appropriately massive fuel capacity to cope; the M1A2 has 265 miles of operational range.  Tanks are designed to resist hostile entry by intelligent humans with tools and potentially explosives; zombies trying to scratch in with their nails are unlikely to succeed.  You might well easily drive down the highway, say 20 miles, crushing as you went, turn around and drive back and have time to refuel while the zombies (average human running speed of 5-6mph) are still running to catch you</p>



<p>And while we’re talking about zombie numbers – a lot of zombie fiction relies on creating great hordes of zombies that equal or exceed the populations of humans they’re derived from.  But definitionally, zombie numbers are limited to the supply of living humans at the onset of the outbreak.  Assuming again this isn’t some hyper-contageous airborn zombie-pathogen with extreme lethality, the zombies are not going to wildly outnumber the humans initially.</p>



<p>And herein we have the zombie-lethality-problem: a zombie, even a fast one, is not actually a very lethal opponent.  Zombies attack with fists, finger-nails and teeth and you only get new zombies when bites actually penetrate.  But biting through even fairly thin fabric is extremely difficult!  Humans, unlike cats or dogs, do not have mouths and teeth designed to disable resisting prey (which is why we needed tools to do that).  Our canine teeth are kind of pathetic – and penetrating thick fabric with teeth or claws is not a sure thing for animals like cats and dogs that <em>do</em> have developed claws and fangs.  By contrast, an adult human with a good kitchen knife or a frying pan (much less a home defense firearm) is substantially more lethal!  Sharp, metal things like shovels and knives can penetrate skulls just fine (much less things like machetes or weaponized entrenching tools).  In the absence of mass numerical superiority that lets zombies mob down individual humans, it’s hard to see how they achieve that higher-than-1:1 casualty ratio they need to not simply fizzle out, even against civilians with improvised weapons.</p>



<p>Honestly, given opponents who can only attack with their teeth and fingernails, I’d go further and say that I’d say the advantage is probably held by any disciplined, iron-age or later army if the issue came to an actual <em>battle</em> rather than an issue of epidemic disease control.  Even thick clothing – much less modern riot armor or combat armor – is likely to be extremely resistant to zombie attack unless the wearer can be pulled down and held down.  The thing is, a dense mass of heavy infantry –  be it modern soldiers with rifles and bayonets (a thing we still issue to troops, by the by) or just men with spears – is effectively immune to such mobbing tactics.  Spanish military performance in the conquest of the Aztecs and the Inca demonstrate what happens when close-order heavy infantry are engaged by far, far larger numbers of enemies whose weapons have at best limited effectiveness against armor.  By way of example, at the Battle of Vilcaconga in 1533, an Inca force of several thousand caught an ambushed a Spanish force of 300, on favorable terrain (a hillside where the Inca had the high ground), with the element of surprise, against an exhausted foe (the Spanish had marched all day)…and still lost (to be clear, it wasn’t guns that won that battle, but swords and pikes).  The Inca took some 800 killed-in-action to the Spanish <em>five</em>.  And those were clever, careful-planning, intelligent Inca, not mindless zombies; it’s also a sign as to why ‘fast zombies’ don’t actually change much here – Inca warriors were presumably every bit as fast.  Again, you can propose massively oversized zombie hoards, but remember they need to achieve at least a 1-to-1 casualty ratio; getting beat 800-to-5 over and over is going to make short work of your zombie apocalypse.</p>



<p>(The Battle of Vilcaconga and the technological and tactical conditions that produced it, discussed in J.F. Guilmartin, “The Cutting Edge: An Analysis of the Spanish Invasion and Overthrow of the Inca Empire, 1532-1539” in K.J. Andrein and R. Adorno, <em>Transatlantic Encounters</em> (1991): 40-69)</p>



<p>So unless the initial infection is hyper-lethal, extremely fast moving and can compromise NBC equipment (but then again, why isn’t your story about super-ebola, rather than zombies), my money would be on industrialized armies and their massive firepower and failing that, on disciplined tight-order formations wearing any kind of armor (including just improvised layered textiles) and using whatever kind of sharp, metal weapons they can get.  If the zombie apocalypse comes down to the zombies matching arms with still functional human militaries, the zombies are hosed.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s it for this week’s deliberations. </strong> There were a lot more questions in the first round of question-asking which were very good and on my to-answer list (I’m hoping to keep a rough balance of historical questions to profession ones to fun, silly ones) so fret not if your question didn’t get answered here, we will get to it eventually.</p>
