      <title>Launch HN: Turion Space (YC S21) – Space debris removal and satellite servicing</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28061725</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, we&#39;re Ryan, Tyler, and Patryk, the founders of Turion Space (<a href="https://www.turionspace.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.turionspace.com/</a>). We&#39;re building spacecraft to remove orbital debris and provide services to existing satellites.<p>Orbital debris poses a significant risk to mankind&#39;s future in space. There are currently over 250k objects in space that would destroy a satellite if a collision were to occur. Large uncontrolled objects like depleted rocket upper stages and dead satellites pose the greatest risk because of the potential to break upon impact with small debris into thousands of smaller pieces. There is currently no system in operation that can deorbit large amounts of space debris. If this problem is not addressed in the next 5-10 years, it could render entire orbits unusable for generations.</p><p>Our spacecraft (which we’ve decided to call the “Droid”, shoutout to Star Wars!) aims to remove debris by docking with it using robotic arms and dragging the debris to a lower orbit using the ion propulsion system we are developing under a NASA technology transfer license. Once the debris is in a low enough orbit, upper atmospheric drag will cause the debris to naturally decay in altitude until it burns up during atmospheric reentry. Critically, the Droid would undock with the debris after dragging it to a low orbit, then orbit-raise, and go on to perform other missions. In other words, our solution is a reusable approach, designed from the beginning to complete multiple missions during its lifetime.</p><p>Our team encountered this problem when brainstorming ideas to answer the question, &#34;with the rapidly declining cost of getting things into space, what can we do now that has never before been possible?&#34; Asteroid mining seemed like the obvious answer, but the capital required to start a business on that premise seemed like a longshot to say the least. We found the most important problem we could solve while building the foundation to asteroid resource extraction was to create a satellite system capable of removing orbital space debris.</p><p>Our team has extensive experience working on operational space flight hardware and building software products from the ground up. Ryan comes from an 8.5-year run at SpaceX, working primarily on propulsion development and dynamics analysis of the Merlin, Superdraco, and Raptor engines. Tyler comes most recently to ATA engineering, working as a consultant for various aspects of thermal, structural, and dynamics analysis across a wide range of now-operational space-flight projects. He also worked at Electroimpact, where he designed and built aerospace-assembly-automation systems using robotic arms. Patryk comes most recently from Marshall Reddick real estate where he developed the company’s in house CRM that was vital to the company&#39;s growth over the last 5 years.</p><p>We expect to begin servicing sometime in 2024.  We have gained interest in several use cases through conversations with customers to complement our orbital debris removal efforts, beginning with low-earth-orbit operations. For low-earth-orbit satellite operators, we can raise their altitude or modify the inclination of their orbit.  We have also partnered with launch providers to expand their mission capabilities by offering our last mile tug service for their payloads. For example, suppose a small launcher can only lift a 200 kg satellite into a 500km orbit altitude, but that payload wishes to end up at a 1200km altitude. In that case, we can dock with the payload once it has been deployed from the launch vehicle and bring it to its final orbit.</p><p>Check out the services section of our website at <a href="https://turionspace.com/satellite-tracker" rel="nofollow">https://turionspace.com/satellite-tracker</a> and track satellites or get pricing estimates for different mission scenarios! We&#39;d love to hear feedback and chat about orbital debris removal!</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Varnish: Notes from the Architect</title>

<p>Once you start working with the Varnish source code, you will notice
that Varnish is not your average run of the mill application.</p>
<p>That is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>I have spent many years working on the FreeBSD kernel, and only
rarely did I venture into userland programming, but when I had
occation to do so, I invariably found that people programmed like
it was still 1975.</p>
<p>So when I was approached about the Varnish project I wasn’t really
interested until I realized that this would be a good opportunity
to try to put some of all my knowledge of how hardware and kernels
work to good use, and now that we have reached alpha stage, I can
say I have really enjoyed it.</p>
<section id="so-what-s-wrong-with-1975-programming">
<h2>So what’s wrong with 1975 programming ?<a href="#so-what-s-wrong-with-1975-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The really short answer is that computers do not have two kinds of
storage any more.</p>
<p>It used to be that you had the primary store, and it was anything
from acoustic delaylines filled with mercury via small magnetic
dougnuts via transistor flip-flops to dynamic RAM.</p>
<p>And then there were the secondary store, paper tape, magnetic tape,
disk drives the size of houses, then the size of washing machines
and these days so small that girls get disappointed if think they
got hold of something else than the MP3 player you had in your
pocket.</p>
<p>And people program this way.</p>
<p>They have variables in “memory” and move data to and from “disk”.</p>
<p>Take Squid for instance, a 1975 program if I ever saw one: You tell
it how much RAM it can use and how much disk it can use. It will
then spend inordinate amounts of time keeping track of what HTTP
objects are in RAM and which are on disk and it will move them forth
and back depending on traffic patterns.</p>
<p>Well, today computers really only have one kind of storage, and it
is usually some sort of disk, the operating system and the virtual
memory management hardware has converted the RAM to a cache for the
disk storage.</p>
<p>So what happens with squids elaborate memory management is that it
gets into fights with the kernels elaborate memory management, and
like any civil war, that never gets anything done.</p>
<p>What happens is this: Squid creates a HTTP object in “RAM” and it
gets used some times rapidly after creation. Then after some time
it get no more hits and the kernel notices this. Then somebody tries
to get memory from the kernel for something and the kernel decides
to push those unused pages of memory out to swap space and use the
(cache-RAM) more sensibly for some data which is actually used by
a program. This however, is done without squid knowing about it.
Squid still thinks that these http objects are in RAM, and they
will be, the very second it tries to access them, but until then,
the RAM is used for something productive.</p>
<p>This is what Virtual Memory is all about.</p>
<p>If squid did nothing else, things would be fine, but this is where
the 1975 programming kicks in.</p>
<p>After some time, squid will also notice that these objects are
unused, and it decides to move them to disk so the RAM can be used
for more busy data. So squid goes out, creates a file and then it
writes the http objects to the file.</p>
<p>Here we switch to the high-speed camera: Squid calls write(2), the
address i gives is a “virtual address” and the kernel has it marked
as “not at home”.</p>
<p>So the CPU hardwares paging unit will raise a trap, a sort of
interrupt to the operating system telling it “fix the memory please”.</p>
<p>The kernel tries to find a free page, if there are none, it will
take a little used page from somewhere, likely another little used
squid object, write it to the paging poll space on the disk (the
“swap area”) when that write completes, it will read from another
place in the paging pool the data it “paged out” into the now unused
RAM page, fix up the paging tables, and retry the instruction which
failed.</p>
<p>Squid knows nothing about this, for squid it was just a single
normal memory acces.</p>
<p>So now squid has the object in a page in RAM and written to the
disk two places: one copy in the operating systems paging space and
one copy in the filesystem.</p>
<p>Squid now uses this RAM for something else but after some time, the
HTTP object gets a hit, so squid needs it back.</p>
<p>First squid needs some RAM, so it may decide to push another HTTP
object out to disk (repeat above), then it reads the filesystem
file back into RAM, and then it sends the data on the network
connections socket.</p>
<p>Did any of that sound like wasted work to you ?</p>
<p>Here is how Varnish does it:</p>
<p>Varnish allocate some virtual memory, it tells the operating system
to back this memory with space from a disk file. When it needs to
send the object to a client, it simply refers to that piece of
virtual memory and leaves the rest to the kernel.</p>
<p>If/when the kernel decides it needs to use RAM for something else,
the page will get written to the backing file and the RAM page
reused elsewhere.</p>
<p>When Varnish next time refers to the virtual memory, the operating
system will find a RAM page, possibly freeing one, and read the
contents in from the backing file.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Varnish doesn’t really try to control what is cached
in RAM and what is not, the kernel has code and hardware support
to do a good job at that, and it does a good job.</p>
<p>Varnish also only has a single file on the disk whereas squid puts
one object in its own separate file. The HTTP objects are not needed
as filesystem objects, so there is no point in wasting time in the
filesystem name space (directories, filenames and all that) for
each object, all we need to have in Varnish is a pointer into virtual
memory and a length, the kernel does the rest.</p>
<p>Virtual memory was meant to make it easier to program when data was
larger than the physical memory, but people have still not caught
on.</p>

<section id="more-caches">
<h2>More caches<a href="#more-caches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>But there are more caches around, the silicon mafia has more or
less stalled at 4GHz CPU clock and to get even that far they have
had to put level 1, 2 and sometimes 3 caches between the CPU and
the RAM (which is the level 4 cache), there are also things like
write buffers, pipeline and page-mode fetches involved, all to make
it a tad less slow to pick up something from memory.</p>
<p>And since they have hit the 4GHz limit, but decreasing silicon
feature sizes give them more and more transistors to work with,
multi-cpu designs have become the fancy of the world, despite the
fact that they suck as a programming model.</p>
<p>Multi-CPU systems is nothing new, but writing programs that use
more than one CPU at a time has always been tricky and it still is.</p>
<p>Writing programs that perform well on multi-CPU systems is even trickier.</p>
<p>Imagine I have two statistics counters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>unsigned    n_foo;
unsigned    n_bar;</p></blockquote>
<p>So one CPU is chugging along and has to execute n_foo++</p>
<p>To do that, it read n_foo and then write n_foo back. It may or may
not involve a load into a CPU register, but that is not important.</p>
<p>To read a memory location means to check if we have it in the CPUs
level 1 cache. It is unlikely to be unless it is very frequently
used. Next check the level two cache, and let us assume that is a
miss as well.</p>
<p>If this is a single CPU system, the game ends here, we pick it out
of RAM and move on.</p>
<p>On a Multi-CPU system, and it doesn’t matter if the CPUs share a
socket or have their own, we first have to check if any of the other
CPUs have a modified copy of n_foo stored in their caches, so a
special bus-transaction goes out to find this out, if if some cpu
comes back and says “yeah, I have it” that cpu gets to write it to
RAM. On good hardware designs, our CPU will listen in on the bus
during that write operation, on bad designs it will have to do a
memory read afterwards.</p>
<p>Now the CPU can increment the value of n_foo, and write it back.
But it is unlikely to go directly back to memory, we might need it
again quickly, so the modified value gets stored in our own L1 cache
and then at some point, it will end up in RAM.</p>
<p>Now imagine that another CPU wants to n_bar+++ at the same time,
can it do that ? No. Caches operate not on bytes but on some
“linesize” of bytes, typically from 8 to 128 bytes in each line.
So since the first cpu was busy dealing with n_foo, the second CPU
will be trying to grab the same cache-line, so it will have to wait,
even through it is a different variable.</p>
<p>Starting to get the idea ?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s ugly.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-we-cope">
<h2>How do we cope ?<a href="#how-do-we-cope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Avoid memory operations if at all possible.</p>
<p>Here are some ways Varnish tries to do that:</p>
<p>When we need to handle a HTTP request or response, we have an array
of pointers and a workspace. We do not call malloc(3) for each
header. We call it once for the entire workspace and then we pick
space for the headers from there. The nice thing about this is that
we usually free the entire header in one go and we can do that
simply by resetting a pointer to the start of the workspace.</p>
<p>When we need to copy a HTTP header from one request to another (or
from a response to another) we don’t copy the string, we just copy
the pointer to it. Provided we do not change or free the source
headers, this is perfectly safe, a good example is copying from the
client request to the request we will send to the backend.</p>
<p>When the new header has a longer lifetime than the source, then we
have to copy it. For instance when we store headers in a cached
object. But in that case we build the new header in a workspace,
and once we know how big it will be, we do a single malloc(3) to
get the space and then we put the entire header in that space.</p>
<p>We also try to reuse memory which is likely to be in the caches.</p>
<p>The worker threads are used in “most recently busy” fashion, when
a workerthread becomes free it goes to the front of the queue where
it is most likely to get the next request, so that all the memory
it already has cached, stack space, variables etc, can be reused
while in the cache, instead of having the expensive fetches from
RAM.</p>
<p>We also give each worker thread a private set of variables it is
likely to need, all allocated on the stack of the thread. That way
we are certain that they occupy a page in RAM which none of the
other CPUs will ever think about touching as long as this thread
runs on its own CPU. That way they will not fight about the cachelines.</p>
<p>If all this sounds foreign to you, let me just assure you that it
works: we spend less than 18 system calls on serving a cache hit,
and even many of those are calls tog get timestamps for statistics.</p>
<p>These techniques are also nothing new, we have used them in the
kernel for more than a decade, now it’s your turn to learn them :-)</p>
<p>So Welcome to Varnish, a 2006 architecture program.</p>

      <title>Who Were the Romans, Part V: Saving and Losing an Empire</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the fifth and final part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/06/11/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-i-beginnings-and-legends/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/06/25/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-ii-citizens-and-allies/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/07/16/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-iii-bigotry-and-diversity-at-rome/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/07/23/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-iv-the-color-of-purple/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/07/23/collections-the-queens-latin-or-who-were-the-romans-part-iv-the-color-of-purple/">IV</a>) of our series asking the question ‘Who were the Romans?’  How did they understand themselves as a people and the idea of ‘Roman’ as an identity? Was this a homogeneous, ethnically defined group, as some versions of pop folk history would have it, or was ‘Roman’ always a complex identity which encompassed a range of cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious groups?  This week we are at last going to look at the end of the empire.</p>



<p>In the first four parts of this series, we established that by any reasonable measure, the Roman world ought to have been considered ‘diverse,’ from its very beginnings as a frontier town sitting at the crossroads of several different cultural zones in Italy through Rome’s experience incorporating the culturally and linguistically diverse peoples of pre-Roman Italy into its army and later into its citizen body, to the Roman Empire of the third and fourth centuries AD which encompassed a bewildering array of peoples from all over the Mediterranean basin.  The Romans didn’t merely conquer and subjugate a wide variety of peoples (though they did that), they also steadily incorporated those people in a process that was mostly motivated by expediency and the desire to wring the maximum amount of military power out of Rome’s conquests but which had the side effect of minting new Romans out of conquered peoples.</p>



<p>Consequently, by the  end of the first century BC, the <em>populus Romanus</em> had come to include the many different peoples of pre-Roman Italy and Cisalpine Gaul.  Over the decades that followed, Roman identity, rooted in the legal status of citizenship (but often having also linguistic and cultural expressions) would filter through the elite all over the Roman Empire, slowly expanding downward until in 212 the <em>Constitutio Antoniniana</em> extended citizenship to all free people in the Roman empire.  People that ‘joined’ the <em>populus Romanus</em> this way didn’t give up their other identities; as we’ve seen their identities tended to layer, with the Roman toga added on top (though as we’ve also seen, that Roman identity, once obtained, tended to be a very <em>important</em> identity).</p>



<p><strong>By this point, I should hope that the Hollywood vision of Rome as a culturally homogeneous society at any point in its history, speaking the Queen’s Latin, has been well and truly vanquished. </strong> Yet that vision of Rome ends up being used to support a particular vision of the causes for Rome’s rise and fall which, having now established the nature of our evidence for diversity in Rome, it is time to approach.  <strong>The argument –<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2017.1390915" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2017.1390915"> a form of it notably made in 2015 by Niall Ferguson</a> (conspicuously not a Roman historian, I might note) – goes thusly, that Rome was once homogeneous, that the superior power of a homogeneous society allowed Rome to expand, that expansion made Rome diverse and that this weakened Rome such that it fell.  Often it appears in the more simplistic form that ‘Rome fell because they let the barbarians in’ with lots of attendant political implications for current policy.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Now we already know at the outset that the front half of this argument – the assumption that Rome was initially homogeneous and able to expand because of that – is fatally flawed</strong>, because Rome was <em>never </em>homogeneous in that way.  But what about the second half of that argument?  Did letting all of these folks from Spain, Gaul, Britain, North Africa, the Levant, Greece, the Balkans and so on, did that somehow dilute the special alchemy that made the Romans successful?</p>

<h2>The Gravity of the Situation</h2>



<p>I want to start with the observation I offer whenever I am asked (and being a Romanist, this happens frequently) ‘why did Rome fall?’ which is to note that in asking that question we are essentially asking the <em>wrong</em> question or at least a less interesting one.  This will, I promise, come back to our core question about diversity and the fall of Rome but first we need to frame this issue correctly, because Rome fell for the same reason all empires fall: gravity.</p>



<p>An analogy, if you will.  Imagine I were to build a bridge over a stream and for twenty years the bridge stays up and then one day, quite unexpectedly, the bridge collapses.  We can ask why the bridge fell down, but the fundamental force of gravity which caused its collapse was always working on the bridge.  As we all know from our physics classes, the force of gravity was always active on the bridge and so some other set of forces, channeled through structural elements was needed to be continually resisting that downward pressure.  <strong>What we really want to know is ‘what force which was keeping the bridge up in such an unnaturally elevated position stopped?’  </strong>Perhaps some key support rotted away?  Perhaps rain and weather shifted the ground so that what once was a stable position twenty years ago was no longer stable?  Or perhaps the steady work of gravity itself slowly strained the materials, imperceptibly at first, until material fatigue finally collapse the bridge.  <strong>Whatever the cause, we need to begin by conceding that, as normal as they may seem to us, bridges are not generally some natural construction, but rather a deeply unnatural one, which must be held up and maintained through continual effort</strong>; such a thing may fail even if no one actively destroys it, merely by lack of maintenance or changing conditions.</p>



<p><strong>Large, prosperous and successful states are always and everywhere like that bridge: they are <em>unnatural</em> social organizations, elevated above the misery and fragmentation that is the natural state of humankind only by great effort; gravity ever tugs them downward</strong>.  Of course when states collapse there are often many external factors that play a role, like external threats, climate shifts or economic changes, though in many cases these are pressures that the state in question has long endured.  Consequently, the more useful question is not why they fall, but why they stay up at all.</p>



<p>And that question is even more pointed for the Roman Empire than most.  While not the largest empire of antiquity, the Roman empire was <em>very</em> large (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9mkLEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" data-type="URL" data-id="https://books.google.com/books?id=9mkLEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Walter Scheidel figures that, as a percentage of the world’s population at the time, the Roman Empire was the fifth largest ever</a>, rare company indeed); while not the longest lasting empire of antiquity, it did last an uncommonly long time at that size.  It was also geographically positioned in a space that doesn’t seem particularly well-suited for building empires in.  While the Mediterranean’s vast maritime-highway made the Roman Empire possible, the geography of the Mediterranean has historically encouraged quite a lot of fragmentation, particularly (but not exclusively) in Europe.  Despite repeated attempts, no subsequent empire has managed to recreate Rome’s frontiers (the Ottomans got the closest, effectively occupying the Roman empire’s eastern half – with a bit more besides – but missing most of the west).</p>



<p>The Roman Empire was also, for its time, uncommonly prosperous.  As we’ll see, there is at this quite a lot of evidence to suggest that the territory of the Roman Empire enjoyed a meaningfully higher standard of living and a more prosperous economy during the period of Roman control than it did either in the centuries directly before or directly after (though we should not overstate this to the point of assuming that Rome was more prosperous than <em>any</em> point during the Middle Ages).  And while the process of <em>creating</em> the Roman empire was <em>extremely</em> violent and traumatic (again, a recommendation for G. Baker, <a href="https://amzn.to/36mlCiy"><em>Spare No One: Mass Violence in Roman Warfare</em></a> (2021) for a sense of just how violent), subsequent to that, the evidence strongly suggests that life in the interior Roman Empire was remarkably peaceful during that period, with conflicts pushed out of the interior to the frontiers (though I would argue this almost certainly reflects an overall decrease in the total amount of military conflict, not merely a displacement of it).</p>



<p>The Roman Empire was thus a deeply unnatural, deeply unusual creature, a hot-house flower blooming untended on a rocky hillside.  <strong>The question is not why the Roman empire eventually failed – all states do, if one takes a long enough time-horizon – but why it lasted so long in such a difficult position.</strong>  Of course this isn’t the place to recount <em>all</em> of the reasons why the Roman Empire held together for so long, but we can focus on a few which are immediately relevant to our question about diversity in the empire.</p>



<h2>Diversity in the Roman Army</h2>



<p><strong>As we’ve seen, there had always been non-Romans fighting alongside Roman citizens in the army</strong>, for as long as we have reliable records to judge the point.  In the Republic (until the 80s BC) these had consisted mostly of the <em>socii</em>, Rome’s Italian allies.  These were supplemented by troops from whatever allies Rome might have at the time, but there was a key difference in that the <em>socii</em> were integrated permanently into the Roman army’s structure, with an established place in the ‘org. chart,’ compared to the forces of allies who might fight under their own leaders with an <em>ad hoc</em> relationship to the Roman army they were fighting with.  The end of the Social War (91-87BC) brought the Italians into the Roman citizen body and thus their soldiers into the legions themselves; it marked the effective end of the <em>socii</em> system, which hadn’t been expanded outside of Italy in any case.</p>



<p>But almost immediately we see the emergence of a new system for incorporating non-Romans, this time provincial non-Romans, into the Roman army.  These troops, called auxilia (literally, ‘helpers’) first appear in the Civil Wars, particularly with Caesar’s heavy reliance on Gallic cavalry to support his legions (which at this time seem not to have featured their own integrated cavalry support, as they had earlier in the republic and as they would later in the empire).  The system is at this point very ad hoc and the auxiliaries here are a fairly small part of Roman armies.  But when Augustus sets out to institutionalize and stabilize the Roman army after the Battle of Actium (31BC) and the end of the civil wars, the <em>auxilia</em> emerge as a permanent, institutional part of the Roman army.  Clearly, they were vastly expanded; by 23 AD they made up half of the total strength of the Roman army (Tac. <em>Ann</em>. 4.5) a rough equivalence that seems to persist at least as far as the <em>Constitutio Antoniniana</em> in 212.</p>



<p>Of course it was no particular new thing for the Romans to attempt to use their imperial subjects as part of their army.  The Achaemenid army had incorporated a bewildering array of subject peoples with their own distinctive fighting styles, a fact that Achaemenid rulers liked to commemorate (see below).  The Seleucid army at Magnesia (189) which the Romans defeated also had numerous non-Macedonian supporting troops: Cappadocians, Galatians, Carians, Cilicians, Illyrians, Dahae, Mysians, Arabs, Cyrtians and Elamites.  At Raphia (217) the Ptolemaic army incorporated Egyptian troops into the phalanx for the first time, but also included Cretans, Greek mercenaries, Thracians, Gauls and Libyans, <em>inter alia</em>.  Most empires try to do this.</p>

<p>The difference here is the relative <em>performance</em> that Rome gets out of these subject-troops (both the <em>socii</em> and the <em>auxilia</em>).  Take those examples.  Quite a number of the ethnicities on Xerxes monument both served in the armies of Darius III fighting against Alexander but then <em>swiftly </em>switched sides to Alexander after he won the battles – the Ionians, Egypt, and Babylon greeted Alexander as a liberator (at least initially) which is part of why the Achaemenid Empire could crumble <em>so fast</em> so long as Alexander kept winning battles.  Apart from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC)">Tyre </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Gaza" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Gaza">Gaza</a>, the tough sieges and guerilla resistance didn’t start until he reached the Persian homeland.  The auxiliaries in the Seleucid army at Magnesia famously fell apart under pressure, whereas the Roman <em>socii</em> stuck in the fight as well as the legions; our sources give us no sense at any point that the <em>socii</em> were ever meaningfully weaker fighters than the legions (if anything, Livy sometimes represents them as more spirited, though he has an agenda here, as discussed).  And the Ptolemaic decision to arm their Egyptian troops in the Macedonian manner won the battle (turns out, Egyptians could fight just as well as Greeks and Macedonians with the right organization and training) but their subsequent apparent decision not to <em>pay</em> <em>or respect</em> those troops as well as their Macedonians seems to have led quite directly to the ‘Great Revolt’ which crippled the kingdom (there is some scholarly argument about this last point, but while I think Polybius’ pro-Greek, anti-Egyptian bias creeps in to his analysis, he is fundamentally right to see the connection, Plb. 5.107.  Polybius thinks it was foolish to arm non-Greeks, but the solution here to saving the Ptolemaic kingdom would have been arming the Egyptians <em>and then incorporating them into the system of rule</em> rather than attempting to keep up the ethnic hierarchy with a now-armed, angry and underpaid underclass.  The Greek-speakers-only-club system of Ptolemaic rule was unsustainable in either case, especially with Rome on the horizon).</p>



<p><strong>By contrast, the <em>auxilia</em> were mostly very reliable. </strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Batavi" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Batavi">one major exception comes from 69 AD</a> – the ‘Year of the Four Emperors’ to give some sense of its chaos – when the Batavian chieftain Julius Civilis (himself an auxiliary veteran and a Roman citizen) revolted and brought one <em>ala</em> and eight cohorts drawn from the Batavi (probably around 4,500 men or so) with him, out of an empire-wide total of c. 150,000 <em>auxilia</em> (so maybe something like 3.3% of the total <em>auxilia</em>).  Indeed, the <em>legions</em> had worse mutinies – the mutiny on the Rhine (Tac. <em>Ann.</em> 1.16ff in 14AD) had involved six legions (c. 30,000 troops, nearly a full quarter of Rome’s 25 legions at the time).  This despite the fact that the <em>auxilia</em> were often deployed away from the legions, sometimes in their own forts (you’ll see older works of scholarship suggest that the <em>auxilia</em> were kept logistically depend on the legions, but more recent archaeology on exactly where they were has tended to push against this view).  Indeed, the <em>auxilia</em> were often the <em>only</em> military forces (albeit in small detachments) in the otherwise demilitarized ‘senatorial’ provinces (which comprised most of the wealthy, populous ‘core’ of the empire); they could be trusted with the job, provided they weren’t the only forces in their own <em>home</em> provinces (and after 69, they never were).  <strong>And the <em>auxilia</em> fought hard and quite well.</strong>  The Romans occasionally won battles with nothing <em>but</em> the <em>auxilia</em>, was with the Battle of Mons Graupius (83 AD, Tac. <em>Agricola</em> 35ff) where the legions were held in reserve and never committed, the <em>auxilia</em> winning the battle effectively on their own.  Viewers of the Column of Trajan’s spiral frieze have long noted that the <em>auxilia</em> on the monument (the troop-types are recognizable by their equipment) do most of the fighting, while the legions mostly perform support and combat engineering tasks.  We aren’t well informed about the training the <em>auxilia</em> went through, but what we do know points to long-service professionals who were drilled every bit as hard as the <em>famously</em> well-drilled legions.  Consequently, they had <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/15/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iii-the-host-of-saruman/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/15/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iii-the-host-of-saruman/">exactly the sort of professional cohesion that we’ve already discussed</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Why this difference in effectiveness and reliability?</strong>  The answer is to be found in the difference in the terms under which they served.  <strong>Rather than being treated as the disposable native auxiliaries of other empires, the Romans acted like the <em>auxilia</em> mattered…because they did.</strong></p>



<p>First of all, the <em>auxilia</em> were paid.  Our evidence here is imperfect and still much argued about, but it seems that <em>auxilia</em> were paid 5/6ths of the wages of the legionary counterparts, with the cavalry <em>auxilia</em> actually paid more than the infantry legionaries.  While it might sound frustrating to be systematically paid 1/6th less than your legionary equivalent, the legions were paid fairly well.  The <em>auxilia</em> probably made in wages about as much as a normal day-laborer, but the wage was guaranteed (something very much not the case for civilian laborers) and while the cost of their rations was deducted from their pay, that deduction was a fixed amount that seems to have been set substantially below the market value of their rations, building in another subsidy.  Most auxiliaries seem to have been volunteers, because the deal in being an auxiliary was good enough to attract volunteers looking to serve a full tour of duty (around 20 years; this was a long-service professional army now so joining it meant making a career out of it).</p>



<p>And most importantly, eventually (perhaps under Tiberius or shortly thereafter) the <em>auxilia</em> began to receive a special grant of citizenship on finishing that tour of duty, one which covered the soldier, and any children he might have had by his subsequent spouse (including children had, it seems, <em>before</em> he left the army; Roman soldiers in this period were legally barred from contracting legal marriages while serving, so the grant is framed so that it retroactively legitimizes any children produced in a quasi-marriage when the tour of service is completed).  Consequently, whereas a soldier being dragooned or hired as a mercenary into <em>other</em> multi-ethnic imperial armies might end his service and go back to being an oppressed subject, the Roman auxiliary, by virtue of his service, <em>became Roman</em> and thus essentially <em>joined the ruling class</em> at least in ethnic status.  Auxiliaries also clearly got a share of the loot when offensive warfare happened and while there is a lot of debate as to if they also received the <em>praemia</em> (the large retirement bonus legionaries got), epigraphically it is pretty clear that auxiliaries who were careful with their money could establish themselves fairly well after their service.  I should also note that what we see of auxiliaries suggests they were generally well armed (with some exceptions, which may have more to do with stereotyped depictions of certain kinds of ‘barbarians’ than anything else): metal helmets, mail shirts (an expensive and high quality armor for the period), oval shields, a spear and the <em>spatha</em> – a Roman version of the classic Gallic one-handed cutting sword – are the standard visual indicator in Roman artwork for generic ‘auxiliaries.’  That is actually a fairly high-end kit; it is no surprise that the <em>auxilia</em> could win battles with it.</p>

<p><strong>The attentive should already be noting many of the components of the old <em>socii</em> system now in a new form</strong>: the non-Roman troops serve under similar conditions with the Romans, get similar pay and rations (forts occupied by the <em>auxilia</em> show no deviation from the standard Roman military diet), a share of loot and glory and can finally be rewarded for loyal service by being inducted into the Roman citizen body itself (which could mean their sons might well enroll in the legions, a thing which does seem to have happened, as we do see a fair bit of evidence for ‘military families’ over multiple generations).</p>



<p>(For those looking for more detail on the <em>auxilia</em>, a lot of this is drawn from a book I have already recommended, Ian Haynes, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3g7KLSW">Blood of the Provinces: The Roman Auxilia and the Making of Provincial Society from Augustus to the Severans</a></em> (2013).  Also still useful for the history of the <em>development</em> of the <em>auxilia</em> is D.B. Saddington, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VoGV12" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/2VoGV12">The Development of the Roman Auxiliary Forces from Caesar to Vespasian</a></em> (1982); this is, alas, not an easy book to find as it is – to my knowledge – long out of print, but your library may be able to track down a copy.)</p>



<h2>Helping Helpers</h2>



<p>That frankly <em>unusual</em> structure for a multi-ethnic imperial army brought three principle benefits for the Roman army and consequently for the Roman empire itself.</p>



<p><strong>The most obvious of these is manpower</strong>.  Especially with a long-service professional army, capable and qualified recruits are in limited supply.  The size of the Roman army during the imperial period ranged from around 300,000 to around 500,000, but in 14 AD (the year of Augustus’ death) there were only 4,937,000 Roman citizens (Res Gestae 8.11), a figure which probably (a word I using the gloss over one of the most technical and complex arguments in the field) includes women and children.  Needless to say, keeping something close to a fifth of the adult male citizen population under arms continually, forever was simply never going to be feasible.  After his victory in 31 BC at Actium, Octavian (soon to be Augustus) had acted quickly to pare down the legions, disbanding some, merging others, until he reached a strength of just 28 (25 after the three legions lost in 9 AD were not replaced).  It was a necessary move, as the massive armies that had been raised during the fever-pitch climax of the civil wars simply could not be kept under arms indefinitely, nor could a short-term service conscript army be expected to garrison the hundreds of miles of Roman <em>limes</em> (‘frontier, border’) in perpetuity.</p>



<p>Harnessing the manpower of the provinces was simply the necessary solution – so necessary that almost every empire does it.  By their very nature, empires consist of a core which rules over a much larger subject region, typically with far greater population; securing all of that territory almost always requires larger forces than the core’s population is able or willing to provide, leading to the recruitment of auxiliaries of all kinds.  But whereas many imperial auxiliaries, as noted above, turn out to be potential dangers or weaknesses, Rome’s <em>auxilia</em> seem to have been fairly robustly ‘bought in’ on the system, allowing Rome to access motivated, loyal, cohesive and highly effective manpower, quite literally doubling the amount of military force at their disposal.  Which in turn mattered a great deal because the combat role of the <em>auxilia</em> was significant, in stark contrast to many other imperial armies which might use auxiliaries only in subsidiary roles.</p>



<p><strong>The <em>auxilia</em> also served to supply many of the combat arms the Romans themselves weren’t particularly good at</strong>.  The Romans had always performed very well as heavy infantry and combat engineers, but only passably as light infantry and truly poorly as shock cavalry; they generally hadn’t deploy meaningful numbers of their own missile cavalry or archers at all.  We’ve already talked a lot about how social institutions and civilian culture can be important foundational elements for certain kinds of warfare, and this is no less true with the Romans.  But by recruiting from subject peoples whose societies <em>did</em> value and practice the kinds of warfare the Romans were, frankly, bad at, the Roman skill-set could be diversified.  And early on, this is exactly what we see the <em>auxilia</em> being used for (along with also providing supplemental heavy infantry), with <em>sagitarii</em> (archers), <em>funditores</em> (slingers), <em>exploratores</em> (scouts) and cavalry (light, heavy and missile), giving the Romans access to a combined arms fighting force with considerable flexibility.  And the system clearly works – even accounting for exaggerated victories, it is clear that Roman armies, stretched over so long a frontier, were both routinely outnumbered but also routinely victorious anyway.</p>



<figure><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxilia#/media/File:086_Conrad_Cichorius,_Die_Reliefs_der_Traianss%C3%A4ule,_Tafel_LXXXVI.jpg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxilia#/media/File:086_Conrad_Cichorius,_Die_Reliefs_der_Traianss%C3%A4ule,_Tafel_LXXXVI.jpg">Via Wikipedia</a>, another panel from the Column of Trajan in Rome.  You can see auxiliary archers in the top left wearing scale armor.  In the bottom center, you can see the legionaries, with their distinctive squared-off shields (the scutum) and their segmented armor (today called the lorica segmentata, though this is not an ancient term); to their right you can see more auxiliaries, wearing what may be mail under a textile cover and using oval shields.  They are fighting Dacians, who occupy the right half of the panel.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Ian Haynes notes, the ethnic distinctiveness of various <em>auxilia</em> units does not seem to have lasted forever, though in some cases distinctive dress, equipment and fighting styles lasted longer.  Most <em>auxilia</em> were posted far from their regions of origin and their units couldn’t rely on access to recruits from their ‘homeland’ to sustain their numbers over the long haul (although some number of recruits would almost certainly come from the military families of veterans settled near the forts).  But that didn’t mean the loss of the expertise and distinctive fighting styles of the <em>auxilia</em>.  Rather skills, weapons and systems which worked tended to get diffused through the Roman army (particularly in the <em>auxilia</em>, but it is hard not to notice that eventually the <em>spatha</em> replaces the <em>gladius</em> as the sword of the legions).  As Ovid quips, <em>Fas est et ab hoste doceri</em>, “It is right to learn, even from the enemy” (<em>Met.</em> 4.428); the Romans do that a lot.  The long-service professional nature of these units presumably made a lot of this possible, with individual <em>cohortes</em> and <em>alae</em> becoming their own pockets of living tradition in the practice of various kinds of fighting and acclimating new recruits to it.  <strong>Consequently, not only did the Roman army get access to these fighting-styles, because the <em>auxilia</em> were actually <em>integrated</em> into the military system rather than merely attached to it, they also got the opportunity to adopt or imitate the elements of the fighting styles that worked</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, the <em>auxilia</em> system also minted new Romans</strong>.  We’ve already mentioned that <em>auxilia</em> veterans received Roman citizenship on retirement, but that wasn’t the extent of it.  We can see in inscriptions that the degree of cultural fluency that soldiers in the <em>auxilia</em> gained with Roman culture was high; they often adopted Roman or Romanized names and seem to have basically always learned Latin (presumably because their Roman officers wouldn’t have spoken their language).  While some units of the <em>auxilia</em> kept distinctive national dress as a sort of uniform, most of the <em>auxilia</em> seem to have adopted a style of dress that, while distinct from the legions, was generally in keeping with the Roman tradition of military dress (which was not <em>quite</em> the same as Roman civilian dress).  They also partook of the Roman military diet (Roman soldiers kept a similar diet all over the empire, even if that meant shipping thousands of amphora of olive-oil and sour wine to northern England) which would have given them a diet in common with many work-a-day Romans too.  Once retired, <em>auxilia</em> soldiers tended to settle where they served (rather than returning to their ‘home’ provinces), which meant settling in frontier provinces where their citizenship set them apart as distinctively <em>Roman</em>, wherever they may have come from.</p>



<figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1930-0419-1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1930-0419-1">From the British Museum</a>, a Roman military diploma (inv. 1930,0419.1), the official document granting citizenship to an auxiliary (here a fellow named Gemellus) at the end of his tour of service.  This one is dated July 17, 122 AD and was found in Brigetio (modern Szőny, Hungary).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exactly how many <em>auxilia</em> would have retired like this requires a degree of number crunching.  Given a 20-year tour of service and zero mortality, we might expect around 7,500 men to pass through the <em>auxilia</em> each year.  But of course, mortality wasn’t zero and so we have to expect that of our c. 20-year-old recruits, some number are going to die before retirement.  Using some model life tables (following B. Frier, “Demography” in <em>CAH^2 XI</em> (2000)), we should figure that very roughly one third of our recruits will have died before reaching discharge.  We then we need to adjust our recruitment figures to retain the same total strength and we get something like 9,000 new recruits each year to keep a strength of c. 150,000 with mortality counted for and 20 year tours.  That gives us roughly 6,000 <em>auxilia</em> living to retirement each year.  That may <em>seem</em> a small number, but that graduate accretion matters when it runs for decades and centuries and the newly enfranchised family units (recall that the citizenship grant covers children and sort-of-kind-of his spouse*) tend to settle on the frontiers, which is a really handy place to have communities of citizens.  If we assume that these new citizen families mostly reproduced themselves (or more correctly that they went extinct or split with multiple children at roughly the same rate with no natural population growth), then we’d expect this process to produce perhaps something like 1.5 <em>million</em> new citizen households up until the <em>Constitutio Antoniniana</em>.  Being <em>very</em> back of the envelope then, we might – once we account for women and children descendants of those soldiers – assume that on the eve of the general grant of citizenship in 212, there were perhaps 4 million Romans whose citizenship status was a product of service in the <em>auxilia</em> somewhere in their history; perhaps representing something like 7% of the entire population (including non-free persons).  Were we to assume larger households (which seems wise, given that retired auxiliaries are probably more likely than average to be in an economic position to have a larger family), that figure would be even higher.</p>



<p>(*Note on the coverage of the spouse.  The grant of citizenship covered any biological children of the discharged auxiliary but did not extend citizenship to his wife.  It <em>did</em> however, give an auxiliary the right to contract a lawful marriage with effectively any free woman, <em>including non-citizens</em> and the children resulting from such a union would be citizens themselves.  Consequently, it extended one of the core privleges of citizenship to the non-citizen wife of a discharged auxiliary: the right to bear citizen children.  Since the wife would be part of the retired auxiliary’s household (and then later, if he predeceased her, potentially in the household of her male citizen children) she’d be legally covered in many cases because a legal action against her would generally be an action against her husband/child.  Given that a number of the rights of citizens simply didn’t apply to women in the Roman world (e.g. office holding), this system left the wife of a retired auxiliary with many, but not all, of the privileges of citizenship, so long as her husband and her marriage survived.  That said, the legal status remained vested in her husband or her children, which made it more than a little precarious.  One of these days, we can talk more about the structure of the Roman <em>familia</em>.)</p>



<p><strong>That is a very meaningful number of new Romans</strong>.  And those figures don’t account for some of the other ways Roman citizenship tended to expand through communities both through manumission but also the political networks citizenship created (your Latin-speaking former-auxiliary citizen neighbors are a lot more likely to be able to help intercede to get <em>you</em> citizenship or get your community recognized as a <em>municipia</em> with that attendant citizenship grant). <strong> And not only are those new Romans by legal status, but new Romans who have, by dint of military training and discipline, absorbed quite a lot of Roman culture</strong>.  <strong>As best we can tell, they tended to view the Roman Empire as <em>their</em> polity</strong>, rather than as a foreign or oppressive entity.  They were ‘bought in’ as it were.  Again, this does not seem to have been the Roman intent, but rather an opportunistic, self-serving response to the need to maintain the loyalty of these troops; citizenship was, after all, a free benefit the emperor might bestow at no cost to the treasury (since citizens who lived outside of Italy still owed taxes) or himself.</p>



<p>Of course that fits the <em>auxilia</em> in to a later pattern in the provinces which becomes perhaps most apparent as the Roman Empire begins to collapse…</p>



<h2>Kicking, Gouging and Screaming</h2>



<p>The fall of the Roman Empire in the West (please, right now, just mentally add the phrase ‘in the west’ next to every ‘the fall of Rome’ and similar phrase here and elsewhere) is complicated.  I don’t mean it is complicated in its causes or effects (though it is that too), I mean it is complicated in its raw events: the who, what, where and when of it.  Most students are taught a fairly simple version of this because most of what they need to actually learn is the cause and the effects and so the actual ‘fall’ part is a sort of black box where Huns, Vandals, Goths, plague, climate and economic decline go in and political fragmentation, more economic decline and the European Middle Ages come out.  The fall itself ends up feeling like an event rather than a process because it is compressed down to a single point, the black box where all of the causes become all of the effects.  That is, frankly, a defensible way to teach the topic at a survey level (where it might get at most a lecture or two either at the end of a Roman History survey or the beginning of a Medieval History survey) and it is honestly more or less how I teach it.</p>



<p><strong>But if you want to actually try to say something <em>intelligent</em> about the whole thing, you need to grapple with what actually happened, rather than the classroom black-box model designed for teaching efficiency rather than detail.</strong>  We are…not going to do that today…though I will have some bibliography here for those who want to. <strong> The key thing here is that the ‘Fall of Rome’ (in the West) is not an event, but a <em>century long</em> process from 376 to 476. Rome power (in the West) contracts for a lot of that, but it expands in periods as well, particularly under the leadership of Aetius (433-454) and Majorian (457-461); there are points where it would have really looked like the Romans might actually be able to recover</strong>.  Even in 476 it was not obvious to anyone that Roman rule had actually ended; Odoacer, who had just deposed what was to be the last Roman emperor in the west promptly offered the crown to Zeno, the Roman emperor in the East (there is argument about his sincerity but <a href="https://amzn.to/2VlzAPq" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/2VlzAPq">James O’Donnell argues</a> – very well, though I disagree on some key points – that this represented a real opportunity for Rome to rise from defeat in a new form yet again).</p>



<figure><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire#/media/File:MajorianEmpire.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire#/media/File:MajorianEmpire.png">Via Wikipedia</a>, a map of the fragmentation of the Western Roman Empire, but also noting Majorian’s considerable reconquests.  One wonders, had he not been killed by Ricimer in 461 what he might have achieved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Glancing even further back historically, this wasn’t even the first time the Roman Empire had been on the brink of collapse.  Beginning in 238, the Roman Empire had suffered a long series of crippling civil wars and succession crises collectively known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a> (238-284).  At one point, the empire was <em>de facto</em> split into three, with one emperor in Britain and Gaul, another in Italy, and the client kingdom of Palmyra essentially running the Eastern half of the empire under their queen Zenobia.  <strong>Empires do not usually survive those kinds of catastrophes, but the Roman Empire survived the Crisis, recovered all of its territory (save Dacia) and even enjoyed a period of relative peace afterwards, before trouble started up again.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The <em>reason</em> that empires do not generally survive those kinds of catastrophes is that generally when empires weaken, they find that they contain all sorts of people who have been waiting, sometimes patiently, sometimes less so, for any opportunity to break away</strong>.  The rather sudden collapse of the (Neo-)Assyrian Empire (911-609 BC) is a good case study.  After having conquered much of the Near East, the Assyrians fell into a series of succession wars beginning in 627; their Mesopotamian subjects smelled blood and revolted in 625.  That was almost under control by 620 when the Medes and Persians, external vassals of the Assyrians, smelled blood too and invaded, allying with the rebelling Babylonians in 616.  <strong>Assyria was effectively gone by 612 with the loss and destruction of Ninevah; they had gone from the largest empire in the world at that time <em>or at any point prior</em> to non-existent in 15 years</strong>.  While the Assyrian collapse is remarkable for its speed and finality, the overall process is much the same in most cases; once imperial power begins to wane, revolt suddenly looks more possible and so the downward slope of collapse can be very steep indeed (one might equally use the case study of decolonization after WWII as an example: each newly independent country increased the pressure on all of the rest).</p>



<p><strong>Yet there is no great rush to the doors for Rome</strong>.  Instead, as Guy Halsall puts it in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3f8miwW" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3f8miwW">Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West</a></em> (2007), “The West did not drift hopelessly towards its inevitable fate.  It went down kicking, gouging and screaming.”  Among the kicked and gouged of course were Attila and his Huns.  Fought to a draw at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, his empire disintegrated after his death two years later under pressure from both Germanic tribes and the Eastern Roman Empire (and the standard tendency for Steppe empires to fragment); of his three sons, Ellac was killed by revolting Germanic peoples who had been subject to the Huns, Dengizich by the (Eastern) Romans (we’re told his head was put on display in Constantinople) and the last, Ernak just disappears in our narrative after the death of Dengizich.  The Romans, it turns out, did eventually get down to business to defeat the Huns.  But the Romans doing all of that kicking, gouging and screaming were not the handful of old families from the early days of the Repulic; most of those hard-fighting Romans were people who in 14 AD would have been provincials.  And indeed, the Roman Empire would survive, in the East, <em>where Rome wasn’t</em>, making for a Roman Empire that by 476 consisted effectively <em>entirely</em> of ‘provincial’ Romans.</p>



<p>Instead what we see are essentially three sets of actions by provincial elites who in any other empire would have been leading the charge for the exits.  There were the kickers, gougers and screamers, as Halsall notes.  There were also, as Ralph Mathisen, <a href="https://amzn.to/3rFVau6" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3rFVau6"><em>Roman Aristocrats in Barbarian Gaul</em> </a>(1993) has noted, elites who – seeing the writing on the wall – made no effort to hasten the collapse of the empire but instead retreated into their estates, their books and their letters; these fellows often end up married into and advising the new ‘barbarian’ kings who set up in the old Roman provinces (which in turn contributes quite a bit to the preservation and continued influence of Roman law and culture in the various fragmented successor states of the early Middle Ages).  Finally, there were elites so confident that the empire would survive – because it always had! – that they mostly focused on improving their position within the empire, even at the cost of weakening it, not because they wanted <em>out</em>, <em>but because ‘out’ was inconceivable to them</em>; both Halsall and also James O’Donnell, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3zM0fUB" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3zM0fUB">The Ruin of the Roman Empire</a></em> (2009) document many of these.  If I may continue my analogy, when the exit door was yawning wide open, almost no one walked through; some tried to put out the burning building they were in, others were content to be at the center of the ruins.  But no one actually <em>left</em>.</p>



<p>During the Crisis of the Third Century, that set of responses had been crucial for the empire’s survival and for brief moments in the 400s, it looked like they might even have saved it again.  <strong>For all of the things that brought the Roman Empire down, it is striking that ‘internal revolts’ of long-ruled peoples weren’t one of them</strong>.  And that speaks to the power of Rome’s effective (if, again, largely unintentional) management of diversity.  <strong>The Roman willingness to incorporate conquered peoples into the core citizen body and into ‘Roman-ness’</strong> <strong>meant that even by 238 to the extent that the residents of the Empire could even <em>imagine</em> its collapse, they saw that potentiality as a disaster, rather than as a liberation</strong>.  That gave the empire tremendous resiliency in the face of disaster, such that it took a century of unremitting bad luck to bring it down and even then, it only managed to take down half of it.</p>



<p>(As an aside, <strong>those provincial Romans were <em>correct</em> in the judgement that the collapse of the empire would mean disaster</strong>.  The running argument about the fall of the Roman Empire is generally between the ‘decline and fall’ perspective, which presents the collapse of the Roman Empire as a Bad Thing and the ‘change and continuity’ perspective, which both stresses continuity after the collapse but also tends to try minimize the negative impacts of it, even to the point of suggesting that the average Roman peasant might have been better off in the absence of heavy Roman taxes.  That latter view is particularly common among many medievalists, who are understandably quite tired of the unfairly poor reputation their period gets.  This is an argument that for some time lived in the airy space of narrative and perspective where both sides could put an argument out.  Unfortunately for some of the change-and-continuity arguments about living standards, archaeology has a tendency to give us <em>data</em> that is somewhat less malleable.  That archaeological data shows, with a high degree of consistency, that while there is certainly some continuity between the Late Antique and the early Middle Ages the fall of Rome (in the West) killed <em>lots</em> of people (precipitous declines in population in societies without reliable birth control; probably this is mostly food scarcity, not direct warfare) and that living standards also declined <em>to a degree that the results are archaeologically visible</em>.  As Brian Ward-Perkins notes in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/377rZXK" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/377rZXK">The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</a></em> (2005), the collapse causes <em>cows to shrink</em>, speaking to sudden scarcity of winter fodder (which in turn likely speaks to a general reduction in available nutrition).  Some areas were worse hit than others; Robin Flemming<em>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3BOQLd8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://amzn.to/3BOQLd8">Britain After Rome</a></em> (2010) notes, for instance, that in post-Roman Britain, <em>pot-making</em> technology was lost (because ceramic production had been focused in cities which had been largely depopulated out of existence).  The fall of Rome might have been good for some people, but the evidence is, I think, at this point inescapable that it was <em>quite bad </em>for most people.  Especially, one assumes, all of the people who got depopulated.)</p>

<h2>Foederati Failures</h2>



<p><strong>But if the Roman Empire (in the West) went down fighting, <em>why did it</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>collapse</em>?</strong>  Of course there is no simple answer to that question.  The mass migrations of the fourth and fifth century clearly played a very large role, but then the Romans had defeated other such migrations (recall the Cimbri and the Teutones) before.  There are strong indicators that other factors, unrelated to our current topic were also at play: the empire had been economically weakened by the Crisis of the Third Century, which may have disrupted a lot of the trade and state functions that created the revenue to fund state activity.  At the same time, the Crisis and the more challenging security situation after it meant that Roman armies grew larger and with them the burden of paying and feeding the soldiers which further hurt the economy.  Meanwhile, long exposure to Roman armies on the frontiers of the empire had begun to erode the initially quite vast qualitative advantage the Romans enjoyed; the gap between Roman and ‘barbarian’ military capabilities began to shrink (although it never really vanished altogether in this period).  But some of the causes <em>do </em>bear on our topic but in quite the other direction from what the Niall Fergusons of the world might assume.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the <em>foederati</em>.</p>



<p>After the <em>Constitutio Antoniniana</em>, there was no longer much need for the <em>auxilia</em>, as all persons in the empire were citizens, and so the structure distinction between the legions and other formations fades away (part of this is also the tendency of the legions in this period to be progressively split up into smaller units called <em>vexillationes</em>, meaning that the unit-sizes wouldn’t have been so different).  But during the fourth century, with frontier pressures building, the Romans again looked for ways to utilize the manpower and fighting skill of non-Romans.  <strong>What is striking here is that whereas in some ways </strong>(discussed above) <strong>the <em>auxilia</em> had represented almost a revival of the attitudes which had informed the system for the <em>socii</em>, the new system that emerged for using foreign troops, called <em>foederati</em> (‘treaty men’)</strong> <strong>did <em>not </em>draw on the previously successful <em>auxilia-</em>system</strong> (which, to be clear, by this point had been effectively gone for more than a century).  Instead, the Romans signed treaties with Germanic-speaking kings, exchanging chunks of (often depopulated, war-torn frontier) land in exchange for military service.  Since these troops were bound by treaty (<em>foedus</em>) they were called <em>foederati</em>.  They served in their own units, under their own leaders, up to their kings.  Consequently, all of the mechanisms that encouraged the <em>auxilia</em> to adopt Roman practices and identify with the Roman Empire were lost; these men might view Rome as a friendly ally (at times) but they were never encouraged to think of themselves as Roman.</p>



<p>The reason for this different system of recruitment seem to be rooted in financial realities.  The Roman army had already been expanded during the Crisis of the Third Century and only grew more under Diocletian and Constantine, probably by this point being between 400,000 and 500,000 men (compared to 300,000-350,000 earlier in the empire).  Moreover, Diocletian had opted to reform the empire’s administration with a much more intensive, top-down, bureaucratic approach, which imposed further costs.  Taxes had become heavy (although elites were increasingly allowed to dodge them), the economy was weak and revenues were short.  The value of the <em>foederati</em> was that the empire didn’t have to <em>pay</em> them; they were handed land (again, in war-torn frontier zones) and expected to use that to pay for their military support.  At the time, it must have seemed a brilliant work-around to get more military power out of a dwindling tax-base.</p>



<figure><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy#/media/File:Venice_%E2%80%93_The_Tetrarchs_03.jpg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy#/media/File:Venice_%E2%80%93_The_Tetrarchs_03.jpg">Via Wikipedia</a>, the porphyry statues of the tetrarchs, the four emperors under Diocletian, now in Venice.  While the artist is drawing attention to their notional unity (thus all of the hugging), it is also notable how much the Third Century had changed the job of emperors.  During the first two centuries, Roman emperors were more often depicted in their civilian dress than as soldiers, but here the martial imagery, including the hands gripping tight the hilts of swords, is strongly pronounced.  The emperor was, by this point, a soldier first and a civilian administrator second.</figcaption></figure>



<p>(I feel the need to note that I increasingly regard Diocletian (r. 284-305) as a ruinous emperor, even though he lacked the normal moralizing character flaws of ‘bad emperors.’  While he was active, dedicated and focused, almost all of his reforms turned out to be quite bad ideas in the long run even before one gets to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution">Great Persecution</a>.  His currency reforms were catastrophic, his administrative reforms were top-heavy, his tax plan depended on a regular census which was never regular and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy">tetrarchy </a>was doomed from its inception.  Diocletian was pretty much a living, “Well, You Tried” meme.  That said, to be clear, Diocletian wasn’t responsible for the <em>foederati</em>; it’s not quite clear who the first <em>foederati</em> were – they may have been the Franks in 358, which would make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)">Julian </a>(as a ‘Caesar’ or junior-emperor under Constantius) the culprit for this bad idea – he had a surplus of those too.)</p>



<p>The problem, of course, is right there: the status of the <em>foederati</em> made it impossible for them to ever fully integrate into the empire.  They had, after all, their own kings, their own local laws and served in their own military formations.  While, interestingly, they would eventually adopt Latin from the local population which had already done so (leading to French, Spanish and Italian) they could never <em>become Roman</em>.  That wasn’t always their choice, either!  <strong>As O’Donnell<em> </em>(<em>op. cit.</em>) notes, many of these <em>foederati</em> wanted to be ‘in’ in the Roman Empire; it was more frequently <em>the Romans</em> who were busy saying ‘no.</strong>‘  It is striking that this occurs in a period where social class in the Roman world was <em>generally</em> calcifying.  Whereas citizenship had been an expanding category, after the <em>Constitutio Antoniniana</em>, the legal categories of <em>honestiores </em>and <em>humiliores</em> (lit. ‘respectable’ and ‘humble’ people, but in practice, ‘wealthy’ and ‘commoners’) largely replaced citizenship as the legal dividing lines of Roman society.  These were far less flexible categories, as economic social mobility in the ancient world was never very high.  Even there, the tax reforms of Diocletian (with some ‘patches’ under Constantine) began, for tax purposes, to tie tenant farmers (‘<em>coloni</em>‘) to their land, essentially barring both physical and economic mobility in the name of more efficient tax collection in a system that strongly resembled later medieval serfdom.</p>



<p><strong>Nevertheless, the consequence of this system of organization was that as often as the <em>foederati</em> provided crucial soldiers to Roman armies, they were just as frequently the problem Roman armies were being sent to address</strong>.  Never fully incorporated into the Roman army and under the command of their own kings, they proved deeply unreliable allies.  Pitting one set of <em>foederati </em>against the next could work in the short-term, but in the long term, without any plan to permanently incorporate the <em>foederati</em> into Roman society, fragmentation was inevitable.  <strong>The Roman abandonment of the successful older systems for managing diverse armies </strong>(on account that they were too expensive) <strong>turned the <em>foederati </em>from a potential source of vital manpower into the central cause of imperial collapse in the West.</strong></p>



<h2>Losing the Habit</h2>



<p><strong>This trend towards calcification had been matched by the loss of Rome’s (admittedly opportunistic and unevenly applied) religious tolerance</strong>.  This is often attributed to Christianity itself, but is perhaps better understood in light of the increasing demands of emperors during and after the Crisis of the Third Century to insist on unity through uniformity.  <strong>The first empire-wide systemic persecution of Christians, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decian_persecution" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decian_persecution">Decian Persecution</a> (250 AD) was exactly this – an effort to have all Romans everywhere sacrifice for the safety of the emperor as an act of unity</strong> to strengthen his reign which rather backfired because it seems not to have occurred to Decius that Christians (of whom, by 250, there were many) would be unable to participate.  <strong>Diocletian likewise launched the Great Persecution in 303 as part of a program to stress unity in worship and try to bind the fractured Roman Empire together</strong>, particularly by emphasizing the cults of Jupiter and Hercules.  From that perspective, Christians were a threat to the enforced, homogeneous unity Diocletian wanted to foster and thus had to be brought back or removed, though of course in the event Christianity’s roots were by 303 far too deep for it to be uprooted.</p>



<p>That is part of the context where we should understand Constantine (r. 306-337).  Constantine is famous for declaring the toleration of Christianity in the empire and being the first emperor to convert to Christianity (only on on his death-bed).  What is less well known is that, having selected Christianity as his favored religion,<strong> Constantine – seeking <em>unity</em> again – promptly set out to unify his new favored religion, by force if necessary</strong>.  A schism had arose as a consequence of Diocletian’s persecution and – now that Christianity was in the good graces of the emperor – both sides sought Constantine’s aid in suppressing the other in what became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatism" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatism">Donatism controversy</a>, as the side which was eventually branded heretical supported a Christian bishop named Donatus.  Constantine, after failing to get the two groups to agree settled on persecuting one of them (the Donatists) out of existence (which didn’t work either).</p>



<p>It is in that context that later Christian emperor’s efforts to unify the empire behind Christianity (leading to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Thessalonica" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Thessalonica"> Edict of Thessalonica </a>in 380) ought to be understood – <strong>as the culmination of, by that point, more than a century of on-again, off-again efforts by emperors to try to strengthen the empire by enforcing religious unity</strong>.  By the end of the fourth century, the Christian empire was persecuting pagans and Jews, not even a full century after it had been persecuting Christians.</p>



<p><strong>These efforts to violently enforce unity through homogeneity had the exact opposite effect. </strong> Efforts to persecute Arian Christians (who rejected the Nicene Creed) created further divisions in the empire; they also made it even more difficult to incorporate the newly arriving Germanic peoples, who had mostly converted to the ‘wrong’ (Arian) Christianity.  Meanwhile, in the fifth century, the church in the East splintered further, leading to the ‘Nestorian’ (the term is contested) churches of Syria and the Coptic Church in Egypt on the ‘outs’ with the official (Eastern) Roman Church and thus also facing persecution after the Council of Ephesus in 431.  The resentment created by the policy of persecution in the East seems to have played a fairly significant role in limiting the amount of local popular resistance faced by the Muslim armies of the Rashidun Caliphate during the conquests of Syria, the Levant and Egypt in the 630s, since in many cases Christian communities viewed as ‘heretical’ by Constantinople could actually expect potentially better treatment under Muslim rule.  Needless to say, this both made the Muslim conquests of those regions easier but also go some distance to explaining why Roman/Byzantine reconquest was such a non-starter.  <strong>Efforts to enforce unity in the empire had, perhaps paradoxically, made it more fragile rather than more resilient.</strong></p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Reaching back to our initial question, we now have some answers.  <strong>While the Romans are often presented in popular culture as a homogeneous society consisting of white Northern Europeans who uniformly speak their Latin with a decided British accent, the truth is both more complex and more interesting</strong>.  At every stage of their development, the Romans were a diverse bunch.  Initially this reflected Rome’s origins as a frontier town, positioned at the meeting point of several different cultural, linguistic and religious groups.  The Romans themselves understood their own deep past to have been diverse, with Rome drawn together out of peoples from all over Italy and while their founding myths aren’t particularly <em>accurate</em>, on this point the archaeology backs up the fundamental truth that earliest Rome was a fusion-society.  That diversity only grew as Rome expanded, first incorporating the different peoples of Italy and then the different peoples of the Mediterranean more broadly.</p>



<p>Contrary to the popular image, Rome was a diverse society, by any definition, from the foundation of the Republic (if not earlier) to the collapse of the empire in the West.  This was true when it came to language, culture, and religion.  It was also true when it came to skin-color, although this tended to be quite a bit less important to the Romans than it is to many people today.  <strong>While popular media tends to portray the Romans as uniformly white, typically using British actors, the <em>actual</em> Romans stretched close to the full range of human skin-colors</strong>.  There was no particular arrangement of skin color, hair color or type , no particular ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype">phenotype</a>‘ which was distinctively Roman.  There were fair-skinned Romans, dark-skinned Romans and Romans at every point in between.  That diversity of appearance was true within Roman Italy but became radically <em>more</em> true in Rome’s Mediterranean-spanning empire.  Instead, Roman identity was marked by a legal status, citizenship, which defined belonging in the group; visually, Roman citizenship was conveyed by clothing (the <em>toga</em> in particular), rather than skin, hair, facial structure, etc.  <strong>The ‘Queen’s Latin’ vision of a Rome homogeneously white is wrong in all respects</strong>.</p>



<p>Consequently the theory of empire that is often built up on that cracked foundation, which supposes that the strength of a homogeneous Roman society forged their empire and that the diversity of that empire doomed it is fundamentally flawed, based on an amateurish and catastrophically mistaken understanding of Roman history.  Rome was <em>never</em> homogeneous and so there is no pristine, unmixed Roman society to hearken back to.  Again, <em>the Romans themselves knew this</em> and declared it openly.</p>



<p><strong>Instead it was Rome’s opportunistic but well-honed ability to effectively manage diverse populations which led to their success</strong>.  Doubtless this skill had at least some of its origins in the fact that Roman political leaders <em>did not</em> come from a monoculture; the relatively ‘hands off’ strategy (with a strong emphasis on local self-government) Rome had to take to deal with the diversity of Italy provided an effective training ground for managing a vast empire.  The Romans do not seem to have ever intended to forge a vast, multi-cultural polity out of their imperial conquests; they were, for the most part, in it for the loot, taxes and military glory.  But that Italian toolkit and the habits of politics in Rome’s diverse Republic were things every Roman aristocrat brought with them when they went abroad as a general or a governor (coincidentally, the same job in the Republic and in the Empire, but that’s a story for another day).  Indeed, <strong>diversity was the root of Roman success.  What made the Roman Empire possible, both to create and to hold, was the willingness of the Romans to opportunistically <em>include</em> conquered peoples in the Roman project</strong>.</p>



<p>In the end though, when Rome’s conquests ceased, and with the frontiers defended against migrations of fresh peoples into the empire, the Romans clearly got out of the habits that had won them the empire.  Emperors more strongly emphasized unity through conformity, particularly in religion, and when the Romans once again had need of non-Romans in their armies, they made the crucial mistake of keeping them separate, rather than incorporating them as they had before.  <strong>Diversity did not destroy the Roman Empire, but <em>intolerance</em> of diversity contributed greatly to its fall</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course part of the reason we are discussing all of this is that these examples – often in their deeply flawed, ‘Queen’s Latin’ form – are mobilized as support for political ends.  I am not a policy expert, so I am not going to suggest what particular policy these conclusions lend themselves too.  But I <em>am</em> a Roman history expert and so <strong>when policy makers are thinking about the examples of history to try to craft effective policies, they should consider the <em>actual Romans</em> rather than the image of Rome crafted by the BBC and Hollywood</strong>.  Those Romans were not neatly homogeneous, they did not neatly map on to modern racial categories, but nor were they enlightened multiculturalists.  They were frequently shrewd and self-interested empire builders who recognized that it actually is true that diversity is strength.  </p>



<p>That Rome, the <em>real</em> Rome, the one that exists in our literary sources, in the archaeological record, in Roman artwork (and in my classroom), <strong>the real Rome was always diverse</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s why they won.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference" title="Electromagnetic interference">Electromagnetic interference</a> to aircraft systems is a common argument offered for banning mobile phones (and other passenger electronic devices) on planes. Theoretically, active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_transmitter" title="Radio transmitter">radio transmitters</a> such as mobile phones, walkie–talkies, portable computers or gaming devices may interfere with the aircraft. Non-transmitting electronic devices also emit electromagnetic radiation, although typically at a lower power level, and could also theoretically affect the aircraft electronics.

<p>To prevent disruption to the cellular phone network from the effects of fast-moving cell phones at altitude (see <a href="#Technical_discussion">Technical discussion</a>, below), the FCC has banned the use of mobile phones on all aircraft in flight.<sup id="cite_ref-FCC_Cellban03_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-FCC_Cellban03-33">[33]</a></sup> The FCC did, however, allocate spectra in the 450 MHz and 800 MHz frequency bands for use by equipment designed and tested for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-ground_radiotelephone_service" title="Air-ground radiotelephone service">air-ground radiotelephone service</a>.

<p>A few U.S. airlines have announced plans<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> to install new technology on aircraft which would allow mobile phones to be used on aircraft, pending approval by the FCC and the FAA. This method is similar to that used in most cars on the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterCityExpress" title="InterCityExpress">ICE</a> train. The aircraft would carry a device known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picocell" title="Picocell">picocell</a>. A picocell acts as a miniature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station" title="Base station">base station</a> (like a cellphone tower) communicating with cellphones within the aircraft and relaying the signals to either satellites or a terrestrial-based system. The picocell will be designed and maintained for full compatibility with the aircraft avionics. Communication between the picocell and the rest of the telephone network will be on separate frequencies that do not interfere with either the cellular system or the aircraft&#39;s avionics, similarly to the on–board proprietary phone systems already aboard many commercial aircraft. Since the picocell&#39;s antennas within the aircraft would be very close to the passengers and inside the aircraft&#39;s metal shell both the picocell&#39;s and the cell phones&#39; output power could be reduced to very low levels, which would reduce the risk of interference. Such systems have been tested on a few flights within the United States under a waiver from the FCC.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>ARINC and Telenor have formed a joint venture company to offer such a service aboard commercial aircraft. The cell phone calls are routed via satellite to the ground network and an on-board EMI screening system prevents the cell phones from attempting to contact ground-based networks.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>These systems are comparatively easy to implement for customers in most of the world where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM" title="GSM">GSM</a> phones operating on one of just two bands are the norm.

That ship also carried a huge load of <em>amphorae</em>, containing wine dating back to the second century BC.</p><p>The findings will shed light on Rome’s trade activity in the Mediterranean, where the Romans traded spices, wine, olives and other products in north Africa, Spain, France and the Middle East.</p><p>There are numerous wrecks of Roman ships throughout the Mediterranean, such as the almost intact Roman ship from the second century BC found in 2013 off the coast of Genoa. The vessel, which contained roughly 50 valuable <em>amphorae</em>, was spotted by police divers, roughly one mile from the shore of Alassio, 50 metres underwater.</p><p>In that case, police were tipped off about the whereabouts of the boat during a year-long investigation into purloined artefacts sold on the black market in northern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Italy</a>.</p><p>Every year, hundreds of ancient Roman <em>amphorae</em>, taken illegally, are found by the Italian police in the homes of art dealers.</p><p>In June, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/italy-recovers-nearly-800-illegally-gathered-archaeological-finds" data-link-name="in body link">Italian authorities recovered hundreds of illegally gathered archeological finds</a> from a Belgian collector, dating as far back as the sixth century BC and worth €11m (£9.4m).</p><p>The nearly 800 pieces “of exceptional rarity and inestimable value”, including <em>stelae</em>, <em>amphorae</em> and other items, came from clandestine excavations in Puglia, in Italy’s south-eastern tip, according to the <em>carabinieri</em> in charge of cultural heritage. The collector is awaiting trial.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p></p>

<p>The Blade is built for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/">Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4</a>, which has the same processor as the Pi 4 and Pi 400, but without any of the built-in IO ports. You plug the CM4 into the Blade, then the Blade breaks out the connections to add some interesting features.</p>

<p>A 1U rackmount enclosure is in the works, and 16<sup>1</sup> of these boards would deliver:</p>

<ul>
<li>64 ARM CPU cores</li>
<li>up to 128 GB of RAM</li>
<li>16 TB+ of NVMe SSD storage</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s assuming you can find 8 GB Compute Modules—they&#39;ve been out of stock since launch almost a year ago, and even smaller models are hard to come by. More realistically, with 4 GB models, you could cram in 64 GB of total RAM.</p>

<p>Having the capacity spread across multiple nodes means you&#39;d need to use something like Kubernetes to coordinate workloads, but this is an interesting alternative to something like an <a href="https://amperecomputing.com">Ampere Altra</a>, if you have parallelizable workloads and need as many 64-bit ARM compute cores as possible.</p>

<p>Each blade has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>M.2 M-key slot for NVMe SSDs</li>
<li>TPM 2.0 module</li>
<li>Integrated PoE+ with Gigabit Ethernet</li>
<li>A PWM fan header</li>
<li>UART debug header and partial GPIO header for RTC or Zymkey 4i</li>
<li>1x HDMI, USB 2.0, and USB-C for eMMC flashing</li>
<li>microSD card slot for Lite CM4 modules</li>
<li>GPIO-controlled ID LED and SSD activity LED</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a full video walkthrough of the board on my YouTube channel:</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zH9GwYZu_aE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>I tested the onboard NVMe drive, and was able to get up to <strong>415 MB/sec</strong> sequential reads, which is right at the limit of the Pi&#39;s single PCIe Gen 2.0 lane.</p>

<p>I was also able to communicate with the TPM 2.0 chip after enabling it in <code>/boot/config.txt</code> with the following configuration line:</p>

<pre><code># Enable TPM module
dtoverlay=tpm-slb9670
</code></pre>

<p>I used Infineon&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/infineon/eltt2">Embedded Linux TPM Toolbox 2</a> with the command <code>sudo ./eltt2 -g</code> to confirm I could communicate with the module, and it returned valid data.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But don&#39;t get your hopes up for secure boot on the Pi—it would need support in the Pi&#39;s bootloader... right now it&#39;s not supported. Since the bootloader is closed source, I wouldn&#39;t count on TPM support being added anytime soon, especially since this is the first Pi device I&#39;ve seen with a TPM 2.0 chip! You can still use it for other secure computing features and cryptography storage, though.</p>

<p>The board gets fairly warm, likely due to the overhead of the PoE+ power conversion (which consumes 6-7W on its own!), so active cooling is probably a good idea—the plan is to have an official 1U rackmount case with integrated Noctua 40mm fans at the rear, plugged into the Blade&#39;s 4-pin fan header.</p>

<p>Ivan (<a href="https://twitter.com/Merocle">@Merocle</a>, who posts to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/">@Uptime.Lab</a>) already has a short 10&#34; rack case design, which holds 8 boards, and is working on the full 19&#34; version:</p>

<p></p>

<p>His plan is to launch a Kickstarter for the board, but until then, the best way to follow along is to <a href="https://uplab.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=fdbd31aa8fdf802b1edc668f9&amp;id=2de992b8de">subscribe to the Uptime.Lab mailing list for a Kickstarter launch notification</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/">follow @Uptime.Lab on Instagram</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p><sup>1</sup> Ivan <a href="https://twitter.com/Merocle/status/1422931604855566339">stated</a> the final 1U rack enclosure could support up to 20 or even 22 blades!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___palant_info_2020_02_18_insights-from-avast_jumpshot-data-pitfalls-of-data-anonymization_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>There has been a surprising development after my <a href="https://palant.info/2020/01/27/avasts-broken-data-anonymization-approach/">previous article on the topic</a>, Avast having <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/avast-to-end-browser-data-harvesting-terminates-jumpshot">announced that they will terminate Jumpshot and stop selling users’ data</a>. That’s not the end of the story however, with the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection <a href="https://www.uoou.cz/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=200156&amp;id=1896">starting an investigation into Avast’s practices</a>. I’m very curious to see whether this investigation will confirm Avast’s claims that they were always fully compliant with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> requirements. For my part, I now got a glimpse of what the Jumpshot data actually looks like. And I learned that I massively overestimated Avast’s success when anonymizing this data.</p>
<figure></figure>

<p>In reality, the data sold by Jumpshot contained plenty of user identifiers, names, email addresses, even home addresses. That’s partly due to Avast being incapable or unwilling to remove user-specific data as they <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160203337A1">planned to</a>. Many issues are generic however and almost impossible to avoid. This once again underlines the central takeaway: anonymizing browser history data is very hard. That’s especially the case if you plan to sell it to advertisers. You <em>can</em> make data completely anonymous, but you will have to dumb it down so much in the process that advertisers won’t have any use for it any more.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to document Avast’s failure in so much detail? My goal is to spread appreciation for the task of data anonymization: it’s very hard to ensure that no conclusions about users’ identity are possible. So maybe whoever is toying with the idea of collecting anonymized data will better think twice whether they really want do go there. And maybe next time we see a vendor collecting data we’ll ask the right questions about how they ensure it’s a “completely anonymous” process.</p>

<p>The data I saw was an example that Jumpshot provided to potential customers: an excerpt of real data for one week of 2019. Each record included an exact timestamp (milliseconds precision), a persistent user identifier, the platform used (desktop or mobile, which browser), the approximate geographic location (country, city and ZIP code derived from the user’s IP address), a guess for user’s gender and age group.</p>
<p>What it didn’t contain was “every click, on every site.” This data sample didn’t belong to the “All Clicks Feed” which has received much media attention. Instead, it was the “Limited Insights Pro Feed” which is supposed to merely cover user’s shopping behavior: which products they looked at, what they added to the cart and whether they completed the order. All of that limited to shopping sites and grouped by country (Germany, UK and USA) as well as product category such as Shoes or Men’s Clothing.</p>
<p>This doesn’t sound like there would be all too much personal data? But there is, thanks to a “referrer” field being there. This one is supposed to indicate how the user came to the shopping site, e.g. from a Google search page or by clicking an ad on another website. Given the <a href="https://palant.info/2019/10/28/avast-online-security-and-avast-secure-browser-are-spying-on-you/#what-data-is-being-sent">detailed information collected by Avast</a>, determining this referrer website should have been easy – yet Avast somehow failed this task. And so the supposed referrer is typically a completely unrelated random web page that this user visited, and sometimes not even a page but an image or JSON data.</p>
<p>If you extract a list of these referrers (which I did), you see news that people read, their web mail sessions, search queries completely unrelated to shopping, and of course porn. You get a glimpse into what porn sites are most popular, what people watch there and even what they search for. For each user, the “limited insights” actually contain a tiny slice of their entire browsing behavior. Over the course of a week this exposed way too much information on some users however, and Jumpshot customers watching users over longer periods of time could learn a lot about each user even without the “All Clicks Feed.”</p>

<p>Some parameters and address parts have been censored in the data. For example, you will see an entry like the following:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/email/edit-details/[PII_EMAIL_abcdef1234567890]
</code></pre>
<p>A heuristic is at work here and will replace anything looking like an email address with a placeholder. Other heuristics will produce placeholders like <code>[PII_USER_abcdef1234567890]</code> and <code>[PII_NM_abcdef1234567890]</code> – these seem to be more rudimentary, applying based on parameter names. This is particularly obvious in entries like this one:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.ancestry.co.uk/name-origin?surname=[PII_NM_abcdef1234567890]
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, the <code>surname</code> parameter here is merely a search query. Given that search queries aren’t being censored elsewhere, it doesn’t make much sense to censor them here. But this heuristic isn’t terribly clever and cannot detect whether the parameter refers to the user.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://palant.info/2020/01/27/avasts-broken-data-anonymization-approach/#the-patented-data-scrubbing-approach">generic algorithm described in the previous article</a> seems to apply, this one will produce placeholders like <code>[PII_UNKWN_abcdef1234567890]</code>.</p>

<p>It isn’t a big surprise that heuristic approaches will miss some data. The generic algorithm seemed sane from <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160203337A1">its description in the patent</a> however and should be able to recognize most user-specific data. In reality, this algorithm appears misimplemented, censoring only few of the relevant parameters and without an apparent system. So you will see addresses like the following without any censoring applied:</p>
<pre><code>https://nolp.dhl.de/nextt-online-public/set_identcodes.do?zip=12345&amp;idc=9876543210987654321
</code></pre>
<p>Residents of Germany will immediately recognize this as a DHL package tracking link. The <code>idc</code> parameter is the package identifier whereas the sometimes present <code>zip</code> parameter is the recipient’s ZIP code. And now you’d need to remember that DHL only requires you to know these two pieces of information to access the “detailed view,” the one that will show you the name of whoever received the package. Yes, now we have a name to associate the browsing history with. And even if the <code>zip</code> parameter isn’t in the tracking link – remember, the data contains a guess for it based on the user’s IP address, a fairly accurate one in fact.</p>
<p>Want more examples? Quite a few “referrers” are related to the authentication process of websites. A search for keywords like “oauth”, “openid” or “token” will produce lots of hits, usually without any of the parameters being censored. Worst-case scenario here: somebody with access to Jumpshot data could hijack an already authenticated session and impersonate this user, allowing them to access and modify user’s data. One has to hope that larger websites like Facebook and Google use short enough expiration intervals that such attacks would be impracticable for Jumpshot customers.</p>
<p>JWT tokens are problematic even under ideal conditions however. <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> is an authentication approach which works without server-side state, all the relevant information is encoded in the token itself. These tokens are easily found by searching for the “.ey” keyword. There are some issued by Facebook, AOL, Microsoft and other big names. And after reversing Base64 encoding you get something like:</p>
<pre><code>{&#34;instanceId&#34;:&#34;abcd1234&#34;,&#34;uid&#34;:12345,&#34;nonce&#34;:&#34;dcba4321&#34;,&#34;sid&#34;:&#34;1234567890&#34;}
</code></pre>
<p>Most values here are implementation-specific and differ from site to site. But usually there is some user identifier, either a numerical one (can likely be converted into a user name somewhere on the website), occasionally an email or even an IP address. It also often contains tokens related to the user’s session and potentially allowing hijacking it: session identifier, nonce, sometimes even OAuth tokens.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is this:</p>
<pre><code>https://mail.yandex.ru/u1234/?uid=987654321&amp;login=myyandexname#inbox
</code></pre>
<p>This address also wasn’t worth censoring for Avast. Now I never used Yandex Mail but I guess that this user’s email address is <code>myyandexname@yandex.ru</code>. There are quite a few addresses looking like this, most of them contain only the numerical user identifier however. I strongly suspect that some Yandex service or API allows translating these numerical IDs into user names however, thus allowing to deduce user’s email address.</p>

<p>Now let’s have a look at the heuristic removing email addresses, the last line of defense. This one will reliably remove any URL-encoded email addresses, so you won’t find anything like <code>me%40example.com</code> in the data. But what about unusual encodings? Heuristics aren’t flexible, so these won’t be detected.</p>
<p>It starts with the obvious case of URL encoding applied twice: <code>me%2540example.com</code>. The Avast data contains plenty of email addresses encoded like this, for example:</p>
<pre><code>https://m.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fn%2F
%3Fthread_fbid%3D123456789%26source%3Demail%26cp%3Dme%2540example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Did you notice what happened here? The email address isn’t a parameter to Facebook’s <code>login.php</code>. The only parameter here is <code>next</code>, it’s the address to navigate to after a successful login. And that address just happens to contain the user’s email address as a parameter, for whatever reason. Hence URL encoding applied twice.</p>
<p>Another scenario:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.google.com/url?q=http://example.com/
confirm?email%3dme%2540example.com&amp;source=gmail
</code></pre>
<p>What’s that, a really weird Google query? The <code>source=gmail</code> parameter indicates that it isn’t, it’s rather a link that somebody clicked in Gmail. Apparently, Gmail will will send such links as “queries” to the search engine before the user is redirected to their destination. And the destination address contains the email address here, given how the link originated from an address confirmation email apparently. Links from newsletters will also frequently contain the user’s email address.</p>
<p>And then there is this unexpected scenario:</p>
<pre><code>https://mail.yahoo.com/d/search/name=John%2520Smith&amp;emailAddresses=me%2540example.com
</code></pre>
<p>I have no idea why search in Yahoo Mail will encode parameters twice but it does. And searches of Yahoo Mail users contain plenty of names and email addresses of the people they communicate with.</p>
<p>Note that I only mentioned the most obvious encoding approach here. Some websites encode their parameters using Base64 encoding for some reason, and these also contain email addresses quite frequently.</p>

<p>So far we have names, email and IP addresses. That’s interesting of course but where do these users actually live? Jumpshot data provides only a rough approximation for that. Luckily (or unfortunately – for the users), Google Maps is a wildly popular service, and so it is very present in the data. For example:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.google.de/maps/@52.518283,13.3735008,17z
</code></pre>
<p>That’s a set of very precise geographical coordinates, could it be the user’s home? It could be, but it also might be a place where they wanted to go, or just an area that they looked at. The following entry is actually way more telling:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.google.de/maps/dir/Platz+der+Republik+1,+10557+Berlin/
Museum+für+Kommunikation,+Leipziger+Straße,+Berlin/@52.5140286,13.3774848,16z
</code></pre>
<p>By Avast’s standards, a route planned on Google Maps isn’t personally identifiable information – any number of people could have planned the same route. However, if the start of the route is an address and the end a museum, a hotel or a restaurant, it’s a fairly safe bet that the address is actually the user’s home address. Even when it isn’t obvious which end of the route the user lives at, the ZIP code in the Jumpshot data helps one make an educated guess here.</p>
<p>And then you type “Platz der Republik 1, Berlin” into a search engine and in quite a few cases the address will immediately map to a name. So your formerly anonymous user is now called Angela Merkel.</p>

<p>In 2015 Avast’s then-CTO Ondřej Vlček <a href="https://forum.avast.com/?topic=171725.0">promised</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These aggregated results are the only thing that Avast makes available to Jumpshot customers and end users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aggregation would combine data from multiple users into a single record, an approach that would make conclusions about individual users much harder. Sounds quite privacy-friendly? Unfortunately, Jumpshot’s marketing already cast significant doubt on the claims that aggregation is being used consistently.</p>
<p>What was <a href="https://palant.info/2020/01/27/avasts-broken-data-anonymization-approach/#what-about-aggregation">merely a suspicion</a> in my previous blog post is now a fact. I don’t want to say anything about Jumpshot data in general, I haven’t seen all of it. But the data I saw wasn’t aggregated at all, each record was associated with exactly one user and there was a unique user identifier to tell records from different users apart. Also, I’ve seen marketing material for the “All Clicks Feed” suggesting that this data isn’t aggregated either.</p>
<p>The broken promises here aren’t terribly surprising, aggregated data is much harder to monetize. I already quoted Graham Cluley before with <a href="https://www.grahamcluley.com/week-avg-flogs-web-browsing-search-history/">his prediction</a> from 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But let’s not kid ourselves. Advertisers aren’t interested in data which can’t help them target you. If they really didn’t feel it could help them identify potential customers then the data wouldn’t have any value, and they wouldn’t be interested in paying AVG to access it.</p>

<p>I looked into a week’s worth of data from a “limited insights” product sold by Jumpshot and I was already able to identify a large number of users, sometimes along with their porn watching habits. The way this data was anonymized by Avast is insufficient to say the least. Companies with full access to the “every click, on every site” product were likely able to identify and subsequently stalk the majority of the affected users. The process of identifying users was easy to automate, e.g. by looking for double encoded email addresses or planned Google Maps routes.</p>
<p>The only remaining question is: why is it that Avast was so vehemently denying selling any personally identifiable data? Merely a few days before deciding to shut down Jumpshot Avast’s CEO Ondřej Vlček repeated in a <a href="https://blog.avast.com/our-commitment-to-responsible-data-use">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure our users that at no time have we sold any personally identifiable information to a third party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far we only suspected, now we can all be certain that this statement isn’t true. To give them the benefit of doubt, how could they have not known? The issues should have been pretty obvious to anybody who took a closer look at the data. The whole scandal took months to unwind. Does this mean that throughout all that time Avast kept repeating this statement, giving it to journalists and spreading it on social media, yet nobody bothered to verify it? If we follow this line of thought then the following statement from the same blog post is clearly a bold lie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The security and privacy of our users worldwide is Avast’s priority</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I for my part removed all the raw and processed Jumpshot data in presence of witnesses after concluding this investigation. Given the nature of this data, this seems to be the only sensible course of action.</p>

    <p>The Maersk Triple-E Class container ship is 1,300 feet long, carries over 18,000 containers across 11,000 miles between Europe and Asia, and… Its entire crew can fit inside a passenger van.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As a former naval architect and a current <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/">marketing consultant to startups</a>, I found that the same principle that lets a 13-person crew navigate the world’s largest container ship to a port halfway around the world without breaking down also applies to startups working towards aggressive growth goals:</p>

<p><strong>Simple systems have less downtime.</strong></p>

<p>Ships contain simple systems that are easy to operate and easy to understand, which makes them easy to fix, which means they have less downtime. An important quality, considering that “downtime” for a ship could mean being stranded thousands of miles from help.</p>

<p>Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. The rudder is pushed left or right by metal rods. Those rods are moved by hydraulic pressure. That pressure is controlled by a hydraulic pump. That pump is controlled by an electronic signal from the wheelhouse. That signal is controlled by the autopilot. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.</li>
  <li>If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-powered_telephone">simple sound-powered phone</a>.</li>
  <li>If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.</li>
  <li>If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Startups, like ships, can’t afford to stall from system downtimes. Extended downtime in sales, marketing, web, customer support, hiring, product, and other systems may cause irreparable damage to the growth rate.</p>

<p>(Although automation is prevalent on modern ships, it only affects the time it takes to do things and the attention required to monitor everything. The propulsion and auxiliary systems are more simple than ever, thanks to modern diesel and electric propulsion systems that replaced pipe-laden steam plants.)</p>

<h2 id="why-simplicity-leads-to-less-downtime">Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime</h2>

<h3 id="1-proficiency-takes-less-time">1. Proficiency takes less time.</h3>

<p>If the person responsible for the system leaves, falls overboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">gets hit by a bus</a>, or gets pulled into another project, another person can take over without much learning or training. That means more people are able to step in to troubleshoot and fix issues.</p>

<p>For example, an analytics dashboard built with Tableau is likely to have more qualified people to fix it than one built with a patchwork of custom scripts and APIs. Nobody should have to pull data scientists or product developers away from their work to fix a bar chart.</p>

<h3 id="2-troubleshooting-takes-less-time">2. Troubleshooting takes less time.</h3>

<p>In a system where the behavior of each component and its relationship to other comments is easily understood, ruling out issues and finding the broken component—the root cause—is more intuitive.</p>

<p>For example, if a company has many downloadable whitepapers on their website, and they’re all gated behind a single form—as opposed to a custom form for each one—then they need only troubleshoot one form and one automation workflow if the whitepaper downloads stop working.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="3-more-alternative-solutions">3. More alternative solutions.</h3>

<p>When each part of the system has a clear function, alternatives are easier to find.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a Salesforce process that uses a mishmash of automation and third-party tools to score, filter, classify, and assign new sales leads. If that fails then there is no obvious replacement. Everything will be put on hold until the process is fixed or replaced with a similarly complex solution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a sales process in which the sales team is simply notified of each new sales lead along with pertinent details, letting them decide whether or not to follow up with the lead. If the Salesforce notification step fails, it’s easy to come up with a hundred other ways of getting that information to the sales team: Reports, Slack notifications, list exports, manual observation, or using Zapier to send an alert through virtually any medium. The downtime would last a few minutes, at most.</p>

<p></p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="startup-story">Startup Story</h2>

<p>One of my clients was using a legacy enterprise marketing automation platform (Marketo) with 629 automated processes built up over several years. When something broke or needed tweaking, there was only one person among the 150+ employees who could do it. Each issue took several days or even weeks to fix, all the while marketing campaigns stalled. And with each patch, the overall system only grew more complex.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When that person left the company, there was nobody left to operate the system. With every passing week a new issue would come up, faster than we could find and fix them.</p>

<p>To keep the marketing operation from coming to a standstill, I rushed to migrate the company from Marketo to HubSpot, a more simple platform that would be easier to operate and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The migration took just one week. Along the way, however, another complex system reared its head: Salesforce. There were 10 automated processes in Salesforce with over 100 combined operations, all dependent on various delicately timed automations in Marketo. It took two weeks—twice as long as the migration—to understand and integrate those processes with the new marketing platform.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Overall, these two complex systems (in Marketo and in Salesforce) resulted in six weeks of downtime for the marketing team and three weeks of downtime for the sales team. That’s not counting the many weeks of downtime they experienced throughout the past few years, nor the many weeks of downtime they would experience in the future if we did not overhaul the underlying systems.</p>

<p>In the end, the system I put in place had 97% fewer processes (from 629 to 20) while providing all the same capabilities. A bug that was found a few days later got resolved in four minutes.</p>

<p>This experience made me wonder what principles startups can adopt to avoid the pitfalls of complex systems.</p>

<h2 id="principles-for-simple-systems">Principles for Simple Systems</h2>

<p>Rip-and-replace projects are painful and disruptive, even when the long-term benefits are worth it. Many startups—as with ships—don’t have the luxury of time and resources to perform overhauls once they’re underway.</p>

<p>Here are my three principles to follow when evaluating or implementing new systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features don’t justify complexity.</strong> What good is a complicated flight control system if it grounds an entire fleet of aircraft, or an enterprise marketing platform like Marketo if nobody can run a marketing campaign? Choose tools that are simple to operate over those that promise the most features. A frequent recommendation I give to startups is to choose HubSpot for their marketing platform instead of an enterprise platform like Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.</strong> If it takes too long to explain or grasp an idea, then its implementation will be complex, and it will take too long to fix when something inevitably breaks. For example, a proposed sales process that requires an hour-long presentation will be a nightmare to maintain, regardless of how clever it seems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modifications before additions.</strong> When new requirements come up, the tendency is to add layers on top of the existing system—by way of additional steps or integrations. Instead, see if the system’s core can be modified to meet the new requirements. The change may cause (planned) downtime upfront, as with my Marketo-to-HubSpot migration example, but less (unplanned) downtime over the long term.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered.” — Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no question things will break along the startup journey, just as surely as they do on a ship crossing the globe. However, if the onboard systems are simple, those issues won’t leave the startup drifting helplessly in the middle of the ocean.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Whether your game surfaces its numbers to the player or not, odds are it has underlying systems that rely on them, and you use functions to determine how those numbers affect each other. In other words, a mathematical function is usually at the core of the answer to a bunch of frequent game design questions.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>If I increase my strength, how much does my damage grow?</li>
  <li>How fast does damage fall off when shooting a gun outside its normal range?</li>
  <li>How much more expensive is each subsequent upgrade?</li>
  <li>How aggressively does the AI respond to this stimulus?</li>
  <li>How much XP to the next level?</li>
  <li>How fast does the difficulty ramp up in Infinite Mode?</li>
  <li>How much harder do enemies hit in each New Game+?</li>
  <li>How does the player character’s speed change when the sprint button is held?</li>
  <li>How do quest rewards ramp up over the course of the game?</li>
  <li>How much time do I expect players to spend on each level?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on. Sometimes those questions are about the explicit math undergirding game rules; sometimes they’re more about analysis and intent, about the spreadsheet you’re building to later turn into a loot or progression table that the game will express in some other way.</p>

<p>This isn’t meant as a comprehensive primer on those functions let alone some sort of taxonomy. It’s more a collection of interesting specimens, alongside histories, use cases, and observations on their behavior.</p>

<div>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<h4 id="a-note-about-mathematics">A note about mathematics</h4>

<p>There are some mentions here of calculus and some potentially scary notation like \(\frac{d}{dx}\), but hopefully the main gist of everything should be understandable as long as you’re familiar with the idea of functions and the most common mathematical notation. If any part of this is very unclear or you think I’ve made a math error (which is very likely!), a good place to ask me questions is actually <a href="https://forcemeat-ghost.tumblr.com">on tumblr</a>.</p>

<h4 id="conventions-in-this-article">Conventions in this article</h4>
<p>The word <em>parameter</em> has different meaning to programmers and mathematicians. Usually, in programming, we think of any input of a function as a parameter; if I define a function like <code>(x) -&gt; pow(x, a)</code>, we think of <em>x</em> as the parameter and <em>a</em> as some constant defined elsewhere in the code.</p>

<p>In mathematics it’s basically the other way around. Parameters are known or constant values for a given “version” of a function, and the inputs of the function are <em>arguments.</em> So in math, if I define a function like \(f(x) = x^a\), then <em>a</em> is the parameter.</p>

<p>So instead of talking about parameters, I’ll be talking about <em>arguments</em> (the variables that go into a function) and <em>coefficients</em> (the constant values that adjust a function) instead.</p>

<p>For variables, I’ll follow the usual mathematical convention that arguments are usually \(x, y,\) or \(z\). Anything else is a coefficient; \(a, b, c\) are usually additive or multiplicative, \(s\) is usually an exponent, \(k\) is usually a counting number.</p>


</div>

<h2 id="the-functions">The Functions</h2>

<h3 id="the-linear-function">The Linear Function</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s first establish a baseline by talking about the simplest function, \(f(x) = bx + a\). This is useful to point out the basics of parametrization – by adjusting \(b\), we can change the function’s slope to make it steeper or shallower; by adjusting \(a\) we can shift the output up or down by some amount.</p>

<p>The main reason to use a linear curve is simplicity and clarity. Players can grasp a linear system pretty intuitively, and those functions will hold to several properties that players will expect. For example, if you double \(x\), then \(f(x)\) will also double. If you increase \(x\) by some value \(y\), then \(f(x)\) will increase by the same amount no matter what \(x\) was. This kind of clarity can be invaluable to players who are trying to optimize something.</p>

<p>This simplicity, of course, precludes more complex behaviors. In a lot of game systems, players won’t be cognizant of the underlying numbers and will be learning how the system works by “feel” – in which case, using an easily graspable linear function might not even be any more clear to the player at all. And of course sometimes we <em>don’t</em> want game systems to be immediately clear.</p>

<div>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<p>For the rest of these functions, I’ll usually be skipping over various multiplicative and additive coefficients you can throw into these functions to shift or scale their outputs, just so we don’t get lost in symbolic soup.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="quadratic-cubic-and-other-power-functions">Quadratic, Cubic, and other Power Functions</h3>

<p>There are several “families” of power functions but at first we should talk about \(f(x) = x^b\), where \(b\) is some small counting number greater than 1, like 2, 3, or 4.</p>

<p>Power functions “feel” very different in the range \(0 \leq x \leq 1 \) than they do when \(x \gt 1\). Inside the unit square, they “bulge” down and away from the linear function, meeting at the 0 and 1 points. Outside that square, \(f_{\mathrm{linear}}(x) \lt f_{\mathrm{quadratic}}(x)\), and the slope increases to infinity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you expect a normalized input where \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), power functions are often used to add “juice” to animations or character movement, as easing functions, and so on.</p>

<p>The “outer” range where \(x \gt 1\) is more interesting in designing systems. Power functions give you accelerating growth, which feels powerful for players and, indeed, is inherently dangerous.</p>

<p>Say the player character’s damage and enemy hit points both scale exponentially with their level; say \(f_\mathrm{damage}(x_\mathrm{level}) = x_\mathrm{level}^2\). In practice, the game stays at the same balance if the player is of the same level as the enemies, but the numbers grow explosively. As we know, player happy when number big; this is the kind of thing that works well for games with visible damage numbers.</p>

<p>However, as the player gains levels, each subsequent level is a little less significant. You can understand why by looking at a graph of \(\frac{f(x)}{f(x) + 1}\):</p>

<p></p>

<p>A level 1 player fighting a level 2 enemy might as well be doing 25% damage, whereas the difference between level 10 and level 11 is nowhere near as dramatic. This isn’t nearly as noticeable if x is always a bigger integer, of course, but it’s still there.</p>

<div>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<p>In calculus terms, \(\ddx f(x)\) increases as \(x\) increases, but not as fast as \(f(x)\) increases. So while each subsequent level has a bigger <em>absolute</em> effect, in <em>relative</em> terms the percent increase in damage from one level to the next is slowing down.</p>

</div>

<p>Everything is relative, so the “feel” of a growth curve will depend on what it’s being compared against. To illustrate this with power curves, consider an RPG where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As the player increases in level and enters higher-level content, quest rewards (in money) scale quadratically;</li>
  <li>The prices of consumables stay constant;</li>
  <li>The prices of equipment grows linearly;</li>
  <li>The cost of resurrecting a dead party member grows quadratically;</li>
  <li>The cost of retraining your character grows <em>cubically.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>You can see how all those things interact:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consumables quickly become unlimited, at least as far as money is concerned. After a few levels you can buy as many potions as you need.</li>
  <li>Equipment becomes cheaper relative to quest rewards, though higher-level equipment is still meaningfully more expensive than low-level equipment. If overleveled equipment is available to buy, it becomes more and more affordable.</li>
  <li>If you lose a party member, the level of effort to pay for their resurrection is always about the same.</li>
  <li>Retraining your character becomes ever more onerous as the game goes on.</li>
</ul>

<p>These kinds of relationships, of course, emerge from using any function against any other function. It’s very useful to look at the ratios between different functions at different stages of the game, and using those relationships is very important in achieving whatever player experience goals you have.</p>

<h3 id="fractional-and-negative-powers">Fractional and negative powers</h3>

<p>Reconsidering \(f(x) = x^s\), we obviously can look at exponents other than 2, 3, and 4. It’s very common to use a value of \(s\) that’s a fractional number to fine-tune the curve and make it exactly as dramatic as intended.</p>

<p>But there are two other useful cases. The first is when \(s\) is some fractional number between 0 and 1. These are <em>diminishing returns</em> functions, where the rate of change decreases as \(x\) increases, but \(f(x)\) keeps increasing forever.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This kind of function has many, many applications. First of all, it front-loads the effect of \(x\); you get the most benefit from having a little of it, instead of stacking a lot of it. A good use for this might be something like damage reduction. Say you can equip a certain amount \(x\) of cold-resistant items, and all together they negate \(10x^{0.5}\) cold damage. Your first cold-resistant item negates 10 damage. But to double that protection and negate 20 damage, you have to <em>quadruple</em> the number of cold-resistant items you have equipped. Putting on another warm pair of mittens, thermal vest, or ushanka will always increase the amount of damage reduction the player gets, but having <em>some</em> is vastly more important and noticeable than having <em>a lot.</em></p>

<p>Finally, we come to negative powers. If you don’t remember how negative powers work: raising something to a negative power is the same thing as taking the inverse of a positive power; that is:</p>

<p>\[x^{-s} = \frac{1}{x^s}\]</p>

<p>The latter might be easier to reason about, and is probably computationally faster, if that matters for your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that for a function like \(f(x) = x^{-s}\), the value for \(x = 0\) is undefined, and it approaches infinity. This tends to not be useful, so you will usually see this in the form \(f(x) = (x + 1)^{-s}\), which normalizes it so that \(f(0) = 1\).</p>

<p>You can think of this as an easing-out function; it slows down as \(x\) increases, though it never quite plateaus. Effects are very front-loaded; in the graph above, the first point of \(x\) will <em>halve</em> \(y\), but subsequent points are nowhere near as efficient. But the time we’re at 4, effects are pretty marginal.</p>

<p>The clearest use case for this is as a multiplier for something else which reduces it – giving the player a discount based on their Barter skill, reducing incoming damage based on their armor, and so on. Because of its slowing-down nature, it’s useful for negative effects that can be stacked – for example, reducing the player’s speed as they accumulate stacks of a debuff. Subsequent stacks will always have an effect, but the majority of the impact comes from the first one.</p>

<div>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<p>For this article, I’m not really thinking about performance considerations, but they might matter in your game; if a function has to run hundreds of times a second, that might constrain what operations you can really use, depending on context.</p>

<p>As a rule, addition, subtraction, and multiplication are safe to use; division and raising things to fractional or negative powers are computationally expensive.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="exponential-growth">Exponential Growth</h3>

<p></p>

<p>The exponential function, \(f(x) = b^x\), in which \(b \gt 1\). Shown above, specifically, is \(e^x - 1\).</p>

<p>Like the power functions, the exponential function grows to infinity. <em>Unlike</em> with the power function, the rate of growth keeps accelerating in pace with the growth of the value itself, so the relative multiplicative value of each increase stays the same.</p>

<div>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<p>Or, again in calculus terms, \(\ddx f(x)\) is just some multiple of of \(f(x)\), such that \(\frac{\ddx f(x)}{f(x)}\) stays constant.</p>

</div>

<p>Exponential growth blows up even more than quadratic or cubic growth; if those functions created big, player-pleasing numbers, exponential functions are liable to create even bigger ones. It may make sense to use an exponential function when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want the numbers to truly explode. Maybe you’re exposing them to the player and your game is <em>about</em> seeing that giant pile of zeroes. Maybe your game deals with a huge range of scales. Maybe the input has a small range but you want that small range to translate into <em>dramatic</em> changes in output.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: An idle game like <em>Cookie Clicker,</em> where the numbers exploding is the point.</li>
      <li>Example: A comical physics-driven golf game where the joke is that the 9-iron shoots the ball \(2^9\) times further than the 0-iron.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You want multiplicative consistency; that is, the absolute increase when you increase the input will grow, but the ratio between level 10 and level 11 is the same as the ratio between level 1 and level 2.</li>
  <li>You’re not worried about game balance, either because the input of the function is strictly bounded, or because you just don’t care.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Player hit point growth is exponential, but the base is small and the game has a level cap, so we know what the min and max values are.</li>
      <li>Example: Again, an idle game where the joke <em>is</em> that the numbers explode and are unbounded, until the game itself breaks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that while exponential curves usually look like very sharp “hockey stick” curves, you can have a shallow exponential curve! Just use a base that’s barely above 1. Say you use exponential scaling for the player’s hit points, based on their level, and your game is capped at 20 levels. You can define a function like \(f(x) = 8 \times 1.25^x\). This leads to numbers that feel relatively sane – the player starts with 10 hit points at level 1 and will have nearly 700 at level 20 – but still increase rapidly in absolute terms, while keeping the relative increase.</p>

<p>Exponential functions can also be surprisingly intuitive. The \(8 \times 1.25^x\) example above is essentially “8 hit points at level 0, and a 25% increase each level.” This can be actively easier for players to understand, in some contexts, than a quadratic function.</p>

<p>An useful perceptual trick when you are exposing numbers to the player – directly or indirectly through something like a bar that grows in length – is to make each <em>absolute</em> increase bigger than the last one, giving the player a sensation of rising power, while maintaining their <em>relative</em> marginal value. The exponential function does that.</p>

<p>A close relative to the exponential growth curve is the exponential decay curve. This is given by a function like:</p>

<p>\[f(x) = \frac{1}{b^x}\]</p>

<p>It feels very similar to the negative power curve above, but has a couple of useful features. First, it’s inherently normalized; \(f(0) = 1\), and it always approaches 0 as \(x\) approaches infinity. Like with the “small” exponential curve, it can also be inherently graspable if you use a nice round base.</p>

<p>For example, if \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2^x}\), the output halves at each unit step of \(x\).</p>

<h3 id="the-triangle-number-function">The Triangle Number Function</h3>

<p>Triangle numbers are very interesting. Imagine you’re arranging marbles into an equilateral triangle, with \(n\) marbles to a side. How many marbles do you need in total to complete the triangle?</p>

<p>The answer is always the triangle number for n, \(T_n\). Originally, triangle numbers are defined as an integer sequence:</p>

<p>\[ T_n = \sum^n_{k=1} k\]</p>

<p>That is, the triangle number for \(n\) is just the sum of all integers between 1 and \(n\). But this sum generalizes into a function:</p>

<p>\[ f(x) = \frac{x(x+1)}{2}\]</p>

<p>When you graph this function, it looks something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The triangle function looks a lot like a power function, though it’s a subtly distinct curve. It has a nice feature: \(f(x) - f(x-1) = x\). That is, the difference between one step and the next is the same as the value of the function at that next step.</p>

<p>This makes triangle numbers a very useful curve to apply to costs and milestones, like experience thresholds to level up or upgrading something with successive levels.</p>

<p>The triangle numbers are ingrained in <em>Fallen London;</em> to increase an attribute in FL, you need as many “change points” as the next level. So to go from, say, level 4 to 5, you need 5 change points; to get from 0 to 5, you will need \(T_5 = 15\) change points in total.</p>

<p>This intuitive property was also used in 3rd Edition <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, where the XP needed to get to a level \(x\) is \(1000 \times T_{x - 1}\). Therefore, the difference between your current level and the next is always 1000xp times your current level.</p>

<p>If a system exposes the numbers to players, this can be more graspable than a power function while still having many of the same properties.</p>

<h3 id="the-sigmoid-curve">The Sigmoid Curve</h3>

<p>A “sigmoid” is any s-shaped curve. A sigmoid starts at some lower bound, rises steadily, and then smoothly plateaus at some upper bound.</p>

<p>There are many functions with a roughly sigmoid shape, but I’ll talk here about two: The logistic function, \(f_l\), and the algebraic sigmoid \(f_s\).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Above: \(f_l\), in red, and \(f_s\), in blue. Both functions have had their coefficients adjusted so they would mostly line up.</p>

<p>First, the algebraic sigmoid, which has a simpler expression:</p>

<p>\[f_s(x) = \frac{x^\lambda}{\sigma^\lambda + x^\lambda}\]</p>

<p>As far as I know, this sigmoid was first described in the context of game design by <a href="https://www.jfurness.uk/sigmoid-functions-in-game-design/">James Furness</a>. It’s a normalized curve; it always ranges from \(0\) when \(x = 0\) on to \(1\) at some point when \(x\) is large enough.</p>

<p>The two coefficients, \(\sigma\) and \(\lambda\), respectively determine how big \(x\) has to be before the curve reaches its lower bound, and how steeply the curve rises to that point.</p>

<p>There are a lot of nice things about this curve, including that it’s inherently normalized. It also has a useful asymmetry, in that the it starts climbing quickly but plateaus relatively slowly.</p>

<p>The logistic function is widely used in statistical modeling. The traditional parametrized definition is:</p>

<p>\[ f_l(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}\]</p>

<p>There are a lot of coefficients here, but the nice thing about the logistic function is that all of them have very well-defined effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(L\) is the upper bound, the number the function converges to for high values of \(x\).</li>
  <li>\(k\) is a coefficient that determines how steeply the curve rises; you can make this a negative number to invert the slope of the function and get a logistic decay curve.</li>
  <li>\(e\) is Euler’s number, of course, but for our purposes it’s just an arbitrary base. You could use any number greater than \(1\), though adjusting this value is completely equivalent to adjusting \(k\).</li>
  <li>\(x_0\) is a simple additive coefficient that shifts the curve left or right as desired. The inflection point of the curve is wherever \(x_0\) is set – that is, the midpoint in the rise is exactly at that point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the difference in how easy they are to compute, the main difference is in their skew. The algebraic sigmoid skews early, front-loading the effect of \(x\); the logistic function is perfectly symmetrical.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Above: A graph of the derivatives of the two sigmoid functions. They are both bell curves, but the algebraic sigmoid’s “bump” is noticeably skewed to the left.</p>

<p>What are sigmoids good for? Well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, they are normalization functions; they will take an unbounded input and spit out a bounded output. Depending on the kinds of values you expect for the input, that output might not contain a lot of information about the original input, of course.</li>
  <li>Because of their bounded output, sigmoids are great for implementing caps and limits on the growth of something, or for smoothing between two values.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage faloff: It’s very simple to define a logistic curve between, say, 0.5 and 1, which multiplies the damage done by a weapon based on the distance to the target. The logistic function is useful here because different weapons could have different ranges and more or less sharp faloff curves by adjusting \(k\) and \(x_0\).</li>
  <li>Speed bonus: On a game with scoring and leaderboards, a logistic curve could be used to scale a speed bonus based on a par time for the level. Players who complete the level very fast would get the maximum bonus; players who complete the level very slowly would get nothing. In this case, \(x\) is the completion time, and \(k\) is negative, inverting the curve’s slope.</li>
  <li>NPC disposition: Your game is a social simulation and it works by stacking NPC disposition modifiers on top of each other, like <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>. Using a sigmoid can be useful for normalizing an unbounded number into a bounded value, for example as an input to a facial animation system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion…</h2>

<p>Again, this is a <em>bestiary;</em> a limited selection of interesting specimens. There are more use cases and examples than the ones here, but I hope those work as a useful starting point for folks.</p>

<p>If you have a question, want to point out an error, or have a suggestion of something I didn’t include, the best place to ask questions is through <a href="https://forcemeat-ghost.tumblr.com">tumblr</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not the first to apply any of those ideas to game design, and a lot of this is widely known at least in some subset of the industry. Much of my thinking here (and desire to document it) has emerged from conversations with colleagues, in particular Emily Short, who originally pointed out the logistic curve to me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><i>Note: This podcast is designed to be heard. If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the
audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page</i></p><div>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Today on Corecursive.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Let me be clear about this. Commercially forking Zig is fine. It’s MIT-licensed like go for it. But what they did with the Fork was be very tricky about it, right? So, they actually deleted the license file, put their own license in it and made it look like you had to pay for the software. So, they were deceiving people. That was the problem with what they were doing.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Hello, and welcome to Corecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Each episode someone shares the story of a piece of software being built. Today’s show, How to Quit Your Job and Work on Open Source Full Time. This story has it all, balancing open source work and full-time employment, building up enough supporters and enough savings to leave your job. The hardest part to me which is explaining leaving your job to your significant other and to your family and friends.</p><p>And then, also what do you do if your project succeeds, and then someone forks it and builds a commercial business around it? There’s a lot more as well dealing with hacker news feedback, how to improve upon the C programming language and how to be super ambitious without seeming arrogant. And my guest is this guy.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>My name is Andrew Kelly. I am the lead software developer and president of the Zig Software Foundation.</p><h2 id="the-music-studio-project"><strong>The Music Studio Project</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Zig is a programming language, and we’ll get into why it’s needed, but Andrew got started on Zig because of another side project.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I started working on a music studio project, and in this music studio project, you have more difficult requirements than you usually have in other programming projects. So, for example, if anyone’s going to use your music studio software live, for live performance, you have a hot loop where you absolutely must not skip the audio or their entire performance might be compromised.</p><p>So, you just have these like new constraints where you really need control over how it’s going to work. And likewise, if you want to support all the hardware that’s associated with this, a lot of times you’re not going to be able to rely on someone else’s third-party library to do that for you, you’re going to have to get into OC, C++ or another low-level language that gives you the control that you need and the other thing I noticed is that when I tried to use other people’s libraries, if I ran into a problem, I wouldn’t be able to fix it. It’s too slow.</p><p>I’m trying to make progress on this big project and I learned the value of inventing stuff here, right? People are always telling you, “Don’t invent.” Don’t NIH syndrome, but I learned the value of actually, yeah, that is the right thing to do sometimes. If you really want that much power and control you got to do it. So, that’s when I started just really getting into programming stuff from scratch with C or C++.</p><h2 id="reuse-problems"><strong>Reuse Problems</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Even in C reuse is common, but reuse can bring problems.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I think that the natural first impulse was that if someone else solved the problem, just go use their solution, right? It’s already done. You write the glue code, and then you’re off. In a lot of ways that’s smart because we only have so much time, we only have so much ability to analyze a problem space. And the other person has already done that part. So, let’s see what’s a good example of this.</p><p>The audio library would be an example. So, I tried using port audio. I tried using SDL, I think. These projects mostly work, but then the problem is that they solve 90% of the problem, and if you want to close that last 10% gap, you have to start over. So, I ended up writing my own cross-platform audio abstraction called the libsound.io, and that allowed me to do things that the other libraries didn’t let me do. So, for example, I had the ability to just display a list of input devices and have it automatically refresh. If you unplug the mic, it goes away, if you plug the mic in, it shows up.</p><p>It seems so simple, seems like such a reasonable thing for the user experience, but these other libraries just did not have that ability. And it would have taken me probably honestly years to get the feature into those libraries, and then have enough time pass that those libraries got the updates into the various open source distributions of packaged libraries. Because if you use a third-party library, people want to use the pre-packaged versions. So, then you’re even waiting for their release cycle. And then, you’re waiting for the downstream maintainers to get it, but if you put it in your own code base, you just ship it when you want to ship it, right?</p><p>And there’s just so many problems with these languages that get in the way of progress, bugs take forever to find and fix, progress is slower than it should be. And so, that’s when the juices started flowing. And I thought, “I think I can do better than this.” I think I see what these languages are bringing to the table and I think I can take them to the next level.</p><h2 id="fighting-the-impluse-to-rewrite"><strong>Fighting the Impluse to Rewrite</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Did you fight that impulse? Did you immediately get sidetracked on building a language or what happened there?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I did. I did fight the impulse. And I stuck with the music player project for quite a while. And then, to be honest I just went through kind of a difficult life experience. It was a breakup at the time and just as kind of a coping mechanism I let myself say, “Hey, I know you’ve been trying to be just disciplined and stick with the same project for a long time, but go have some fun, start a new project, start a programming language. It’ll be good for you.” And then, it’s never switched back.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, was it like you were like my whole mind is occupied by this breakup, but I think if I start this new project it might be able to squeeze it out of my brain at least temporarily?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. That was exactly right.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>And did it work?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Mn-hmm (affirmative). I mean I think just the natural emotional progress ran its course, but just in the meantime I was having fun with a distracting toy project.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. I mean it’s certainly more productive than like, I don’t know, playing Mario Kart for-</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Mario Kart.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>… eight hours a day or something. I like Mario Kart. I don’t know.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. Mario Kart’s a great game.</p><h2 id="creating-a-programming-language"><strong>Creating a Programming Language</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Andrew had always wanted to create a programming language.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>The very first time I ever used a programming language, I always wondered what would it be like to make one? And whenever I listen to music, I always wonder what would it be like to try and make a song like this? I’ve always enjoyed just consuming things by just wondering what the other side of the process looks like.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>When I was in university, I had a class where we built a compiler, like a toy compiler. And it was super fun. Andrew had a similar experience and went on to toy around with a fork of CoffeeScript. I found playing with programming languages to be fun, but Andrew, he got something different out of it.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>You know what it was? I actually ran my first marathon a couple years ago, but I don’t feel like I did. Because I walked the last four miles of it, hit that wall hard. And I guess most people do, because I was still in like the top 50% for my age group. So, I guess just most people walk at the end of marathons, but in my head, it’s like you didn’t do it. You walked part of it, right?</p><p>So, I always felt that way about the compilers that I’ve made, because if it’s like a CoffeeScript one, you’re actually just outputting JavaScript. And then, for the one in college the professor just had us do C as the output. So, I always felt like I walked the last part. I always wanted to say, “No. I want to make it actually make machine code and make it do the whole thing. I don’t want to cheat on some of the layers.”</p><p>I also don’t want to devalue like the work that people have done. That’s all it’s still a compiler. If you go from one input language to a different input language, that’s a compiler. That’s just my personal subjective experience is that I felt like I was missing some interesting part that I hadn’t had the experience of completing.</p><h2 id="c-is-popular"><strong>C Is Popular</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Andrew understood before he even started what the C language brought to the table, and this is important. C is a small language and it’s everywhere. C is used by 20% of software developers according to the Stack Overflow Survey. Some conditions may apply there.</p><p>I don’t know if the Stack Overflow Survey is representative, but they have a lot of developers using it and 20% of them say that they are writing C. That’s one in five developers. That’s more people than use Ruby and Swift and Rust combined.</p><p>So, anyways, Andrew has his breakup and he gives himself permission to start on his language. His idea isn’t to start from first principles and create a new language, but to look for specific problems that can be addressed.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Is there dirt under this rug? Maybe we can do this a different way. A lot of software is built on premises of abstractions that previous generations have handed to us. Let’s peel those off a little bit and take a peek and say, “Maybe we might want to make some different decisions now that it’s 40 years later.”</p><h2 id="static-linking"><strong>Static Linking</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>What’s an example?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>One example would be static linking. If you’re trying to ship a application on Linux, there’s a common problem people have where it’ll only work on one distribution of Linux. So, for example, someone might provide their application on their website you download it, but only runs on Ubuntu or something that’s close enough to Ubuntu.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>I literally just had this problem. I was trying to install a Python library Matplotlib. And on Mac OS, it was super easy, but to get it into Alpine Linux, I had to install all these dependencies.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>And the reason for this is that they dynamic link all the libraries they depend on. They just expect you to install those libraries with the system package manager. I’ve chosen to make Zig so that the default on Linux is that you do not link libc at all when we provide the download of a pre-built Zig for Linux. It works for all Linuxes, all of them, because the binary has no libc dependency. It just uses the syscalls in assembly.</p><p>And the only dependency it has is a file system and the kernel. It doesn’t depend on anything else. So, that way we can provide a binary that just works for everybody’s computer on Linux just like on Windows and other systems. We got that benefit by questioning distributing things with dynamic linking and saying, “Well, maybe we should go a different direction.”</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Go does something similar?</p><h2 id="integer-casting-rules"><strong>Integer Casting Rules</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yes. I think it does depend on glibc though. I know that you can actually use Zig with Go and Zig will provide the ability to have a static Linux binary and give you this benefit with Go programs.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, were there other aspects of C that you were targeting that frustrated you?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>One is that there are just too many ways to accidentally introduce bugs that are not interesting bugs that you get because programming is hard, but they’re unnecessary bugs, because the C programming language made some bad decisions. So, as an example, there’s a type system and the whole point of a type system is to help you not make bugs, but the type system has some things that it allows with no errors and no warnings that just are bugs 99% of the time.</p><p>It’s very easy to make that mistake. Just stuff like integer casting rules is one, so that’s one complaint I would make. Too easy to shoot yourself in the foot. And then, have a unnecessarily complicated debugging session to solve the problem.</p><h2 id="the-c-preprocessor"><strong>The C Preprocessor</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>And then, the second complaint I would make is that while C code is usually very simple to read, because it’s just functions and data. That’s the best case scenario. It does have just another different programming language on top of it, which is the C pre-processor. It’s not C, it’s a different language that’s based on text concatenation and people abuse that language too much.</p><p>And then, it’s just too hard to figure out what’s going on. You see a function call, is it a function call? If you’re not super familiar with the code you’re reading, you’re always wondering, “Is that a macro? It might be a macro.” Right?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. It requires global knowledge of what all of these things are.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Global knowledge is a great way to put it. Yeah. One of the big design considerations that I made with the Zig language was let’s reduce the amount that someone must remember when they’re reading code.</p><h2 id="software-development-culture"><strong>Software Development Culture</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Another thing Andrew thought he could improve upon was more cultural.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Some people are so defensive about a norm where people are like mean to each other. And don’t get me wrong, I’m a very blunt person. I’m very comfortable with conflict and I can tell someone I think that they’re full of shit, but have you ever gone into the C, freenode channel and just observed?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>No.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>That is one of the most toxic, hostile chatrooms I’ve ever been in. Before the freenode drama, the C programming language channel on freenode. You could go in there and ask some simple question like, “How do I… I don’t know. How do I align a field in a struct or something?” Some very reasonable question, and you’ll get one person who calls you a name, one person who says you can’t period, passive aggressive doesn’t explain it at all.</p><p>One person gives you just wrong information and the actual answer is that you can do it. It’s fine. And there’s some tricks you can do. It’s one of the worst places in the world. I don’t know what’s up with that. So, it’s like the one word I’d use to describe it is pedantic, right?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>And they even have, there’s even a flag and a C compiler that’s pedantic. And I always think like, “Oh, it’s the C chat room flag.”</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>With this vision in mind of a better language and a better less pedantic community and a working version of the language up on GitHub, Andrew starts to get some users.</p><h2 id="releasing-the-first-version-of-zig"><strong>Releasing the First Version Of Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>The number of people who file an issue per week has just gone up slowly over time. The number of people who wanted to help out, submit pull requests, which were up for grabs since the very beginning. It was always done in the open. It’s just slowly gone up over time.</p><p>One of the first projects that I got to see that someone did with Zig was the Pokemon rom randomizer project. So, they used Zig and made a set of command line tools to take the Game Boy roms that were Pokemon ones and just did some rom hacking. And then, gave you a new rom that you could then pop into an emulator and it would shuffle around all the, which graphs have which Pokemon and stuff.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Building a programming language is just a lot of work. You have to find time to keep pushing it forward.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I would describe Zig as kind of like a flower growing in the cracks of the concrete of my career. When I started it I was taking a break from full-time work. And then, I needed a job. So, I got a job at a start-up called Backtrace, did that for a little bit, save some more money, quit, worked on Zig full-time for a few months. I interviewed with Apple, and they just flat out said, “You may not do that in your spare time.”</p><p>So, I said, “Fuck off then.” And now getting donations from Apple to the Zig Software Foundation, by the way.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That’s awesome.</p><h2 id="joining-okcupid"><strong>Joining OKCupid</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Joined OKCupid, moonlighted Zig during that time.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Was there ever any tension? I imagine you’re at OKCupid or the other place. And I don’t know, is work building up or is there things to do? Do you constantly try to evangelize how great your language is to your co-workers until they get angry? What happened?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, yeah. When I joined OKCupid, I had to have a whole negotiation with the recruiter, because a lot of companies just put in the contract something like, “Anything you do in your spare time is owned, the IP is owned by the company.” It’s ridiculous. So, I just said, “You have to strike that from the contract. I’m going to own all the IP of everything I do in my spare time on my own equipment.”</p><p>And the guy was like, “Oh, no one asks for this. We don’t usually do this. I’ll see what I can do.” And I had to take a real like hard-line stance with him, eventually he caved. You have to protect your baby or someone’s going to take it away.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. That’s silly, right? And you know that they had no problem striking it, it’s just they didn’t want to go through the problem of like… He didn’t want to find out who to ask about that.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. He was just like didn’t want to bother.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>True.</p><h2 id="ok-webserver-and-zig"><strong>OK WebServer and Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>But what about your actual co-workers, did they know you were working on Zig? Did you talk about it?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, yeah. I wasn’t shy about that. And I tried not to be annoying, but I couldn’t help if we were… If we had some problem in the code base, I couldn’t help point out like, “Well, in Zig if you wrote… The code would be written this way and this problem would have been a compiler error instead of a bug.”</p><p>In some ways I think it helped me design the compiler errors because I was just seeing the problems that we were hitting in practice.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>What technologies were they using?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>At OKCupid, it’s a big C++ code base.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>It’s kind of unexpected to me that it would be C++. I just assume all like SaaS stuff is, I don’t know, not C++.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. So, the funny story there is that the company was founded, I don’t know, 15 years ago by Maxwell Krohn, and this other guy’s name. Their PhD thesis was called OK Web Server. And it was just like some… It had nothing to do with dating. It was just a way to do security on a C++ web service. And so, basically they did their research, and they thought, “Okay, now what? I guess we’ll start a company.”</p><p>So, OKCupid was actually named after the research paper OK Web Server.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That’s funny.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. So, it’s like arbitrary that they use C++. Well, it’s actually arbitrary that they choose dating.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Right. Exactly. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. It was always going to be C++. They just didn’t know what.</p><h2 id="the-okcupid-code-base"><strong>The OKCupid Code Base</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>The funny thing too is when you’re joining the company they just have you read the paper, because it’s still accurate about how the code base works.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>I mean in some ways that’s great, because like most places have code bases that like, there’s not a single person that can explain the entirety of it, right?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. I agree with you, although I will say just having splunked through a bunch of that old code, I could tell that the founders were just having a lot of fun and just experimenting a lot, just playing with stuff. I’m just like, “Who cares? We’re definitely going to exit from the startup and leave in four years. I don’t give a shit.” Right?</p><p>You can see it in their code. You can tell they’re just screwing around and they really don’t care about the longevity of… It was pretty… I feel like I have kind of like a parasocial relationship with the founders. I didn’t actually interact with them, but I interacted with their code. And I’m just like…</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>What does-</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Why did you do this to me?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. What does I don’t give a shit, I’m going to exit like C++ look like?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>There was a file that was both a Perl script and a C++ file, and to update it… It’s self-updating, so you run it with Perl and it edits itself, but then you’re supposed to… It’s for the C++ project. Does that make sense? It’s a polyglot file.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Oh, wow.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>So, the same file is a Perl program and it edits itself like a weird hack so that it could be parsed by both.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That’s amazing.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>It’s very cute.</p><h2 id="the-stress-of-two-jobs"><strong>The Stress of Two Jobs</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Before you went full time, did you ever feel like this is too much to do this and my job?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, I was definitely stressed out. Yeah. My fiancée can tell you about some of the times I just kind of just showed up very, very stressed and just like unable to like be a good partner, but I never even considered quitting doing Zig stuff. The only thing I ever considered was quitting work. The thing that was causing me so much stress was the feeling that I was wasting my life just on this bullshit. Wasting my life just being a pawn in someone else’s just play to get money, whereas what I felt like I was doing with this open source project was more meaningful.</p><p>I mean we create our own meaning in life. I’m not here to judge what anyone wants to do with their life, if you want to make money go make money, but I don’t want to be a pawn in your gambit to make money. I want to do what I think is meaningful in my life, and for me a large part of that is just contributing as a collective to open source software. And I could tell as Zig was picking up more steam, I could tell that I was missing out on opportunities, because of the full-time work.</p><p>People who would become contributors were kind of just turned away because they didn’t get enough attention that I would have given them if I had more time or just the progress, the rate of progress didn’t match up to my ambitions of what I wanted it to be. I think I just became very, very aware of the opportunity cost I was paying by being employed for someone else. And that was rough. That was probably a low point in my life.</p><h2 id="setting-up-patreon-for-zig"><strong>Setting Up Patreon for Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Fortunately, Andrew had a plan that he got from Alan Webster.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>So, that’s someone from the handmade community. I met him at Handmade Seattle, but I noticed that he was making a text editor, and he had a patreon, and he was getting something like 400 bucks a month or something like that. And that’s not enough to live on. That’s maybe enough for groceries for food for a month, but I thought like that’s progress, and that’s a big amount of money, even if I’m just going to try and save money, and then quit and then go back to work when I run out, that would help me delay, that helped me give me more runway.</p><p>So, I thought, “Maybe this can work.” So, I started just paying really close attention to everyone who did this kind of imitate them. And so, yeah, so, I did a patreon at first, and there was never a spike. It was always just like very, very slow growth. I started doing live coding streams. I started, I just put links to donate to me at the bottom of my blog posts. Every time I got a blog post on hacker news or Reddit or something I’d get like a few more donations, but the point is they’re recurring.</p><p>People are going to add and remove, it’s going to go up or down, but because of statistics you can just kind of count on it more. You can plan your life a little bit more about how much income you’re going to get. That was a total game changer. So, after a few months I realized that it was predictable. And I could actually find out how to quit my job. And then, that’s when I started crunching the numbers and figured out that if I quit and if my donation growth kept up that my savings would start, they’d dip, and then they start going back up before I hit zero.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Oh, that’s clever. Yeah. You calculated not just the amount you would need to survive, but how far you could dip into your savings before you’d come back out the rate of growth or something.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Right. Yeah. With conservative numbers, but the math checked out. Yeah. It was really nerve-wracking and scary, but it turned out even much better than I expected, because the thing that I hadn’t considered is if I quit full-time work and I got to spend full-time work on Zig that would help me make more progress faster.</p><h2 id="telling-friends-and-family-im-going-full-time"><strong>Telling Friends and Family I’m going Full-Time</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Did you run this idea by others? Did you tell your mom, like, “Hey…”</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I told my girlfriend. She was really supportive, especially considering the fact that we were renting an apartment in Manhattan and she was still in school and wasn’t ready to start pulling a bunch of money in with her career yet. So, kudos to her for supporting my dream, even when it was like maybe not financially completely stable.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>She was on board right away?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. In fact, she actually encouraged me to do it. I think I was wavering a little bit, and she was the one who was saying, “I don’t know why you’re so worried. The numbers check out. I think you’re good.”</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Was she the person you were afraid to run with this idea too? I just keep thinking of my mom.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Your mom? What would you tell your mom?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>She doesn’t really totally understand what I do at all, right? I think that it involves computers is the extent of it, right?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, telling her that I was going to leave my paying job that involves computers for a non-paying job that involves computers. I don’t think-</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Right. Yeah. I see the point that you’re making. Yeah. I think for me telling the older generation about this was all kind of fun and games to me. So, for example, my parents are pretty financially conservative. So, just telling my dad like, “Yeah, I’m quitting my job and going to do this like donation thing.” And being just completely… I don’t actually care what his feedback was, because I just, it’s not relevant.</p><p>But it was fun to just kind of make him think like, “Oh, what is my son doing? It doesn’t make any sense, but all right. I guess if it works for you.” And then, my girlfriend’s grandma was the other fun one. I recall she was saying something like, “So, what does he do? He has a tip jar.” It’s like close enough I guess.</p><h2 id="open-source-self-worth"><strong>Open Source Self Worth</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That’s great. Once you did quit, was it everything that you thought it would be? Day one you start-</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>It was even more. First of all, I’ve never been happier. Second of all, I realized that the freedom that I have has allowed me to open my mind up to just other, even just different politics and ways of thinking about society and how the world works. It’s harder to think about maybe more radical ways that society could run when you have to play the game, and you’re spending 40 or plus hours per week clocked in and just like doing the labor. Not only was it everything I thought I would be, but once I tasted this freedom, I know I will never have a boss again.</p><p>I will go start a farm if I have to. My just sense of worth of self-worth has just skyrocketed and I just, I don’t even want to be subject to another person’s domain anymore. I want everyone to feel this way. I want everyone to feel they get to decide what they do with their life and no one’s going to tell them what they have to do.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Did you have a really bad boss?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Actually, no. Well, I did have one or two, but actually no. I’ve had bosses that are fine. I’ve had good bosses. I had a boss that was like a friend, a co-worker before who just kind of went into a manager position. I think that’s why I realized that I never want to have a boss again is that I had a good one and I still really hated him.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>One thing Andrew hated in his work as a software laborer, which is what he calls it, was the presumption of growth and growing profit. So, to support Zig and to support himself and future contributors, he started the Zig Software Foundation, and he started it as a non-profit.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>So, all the income just comes from satisfied users. I mean the product is free. So, the point is we don’t have to grow. There’s no venture capitalists who are breathing down our back saying that we need to monetize our users. The motives that we have for doing features and making progress is just intrinsic. There’s no monetary incentives to do anything in Zig. It’s all just people driven.</p><p>And I think that to me that’s like I’m really happy with it being this way. And it’s something that I didn’t get when I worked at any startups.</p><h2 id="zig-on-hacker-news"><strong>Zig on Hacker News</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Another thing he didn’t get to do when working at startups was show his work to the world, with Zig, everything was out in the open and early on Zig showed up on hacker news.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>A lot of the comments were, “Oh, we don’t need another programming language or this guy’s an idiot. He hasn’t even made a programming language before. This is like his first one.” Not actually true, but that people just say whatever they want to say. It was all just kind of like there’s too many players in the field. Just get out of here, shoo, that kind of thing.</p><p>And I wasn’t fazed at all. I was ready. I knew that was the game and just kept working on making progress in the language and just kept peeling off those layers and re-evaluating like, “What’s the better way to do this? How should the standard library work? How should the language work?” But I also did pay attention to the people who had legitimate complaints.</p><p>So, some of the early legitimate complaints were that the sigils were too noisy. We had percents everywhere. And they’re all gone now. I think that was a legitimate complaint and that it’s now gone. It looks like cleaner. It’s a lot more keyword based and it doesn’t seem to be an issue anymore.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Did you jump on when people said this is his first language or this can’t be trusted? Did you respond to them?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I wasn’t shy, but I just kind of tried to only respond if I felt like I could like look good. What are you trying to do in a hacker news trend, right? You’re not actually interacting with someone. What you’re actually doing is putting on a show for the lurkers of which there’s like hundreds of thousands of lurkers. And those are the people who are going to read your comments and be like, “Oh, this guy’s cool. Maybe I want to actually check out the project.”</p><p>I was actually just trying to sell my personality at that point rather than engage with just people saying stupid shit.</p><h2 id="zig-is-immoral-and-unsafe"><strong>Zig Is Immoral and UnSafe</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>In that first Zig post on hacker news, a lot of the comments were about the impossibility of replacing C, but Andrew hasn’t slowed down, and things being impossible is not the main thing that people bring up right now.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>It’s funny how it just kind of changes course as the language gets taken more and more seriously. And now, all the comments are even starting to shift to kind of like the philosophy of memory safety and whether Zig is immoral.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>The morality comments they come from people who see Zig as competition to Rust, but Andrew doesn’t see it as competition.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>So, there’s a lot of ways that these languages can be complementary. And it doesn’t have to be like a zero-sum game, and there’s a lot of ways that these projects can help each other. So, as an example both projects depend on LLVM. So, on the Zig side of things, we’ve submitted a lot of bug fixes upstream to LLVM, especially regarding non x86 architectures, because we just have a really good cross compilation story. Likewise, Rust has submitted a lot of fixes to LLVM having to do with aliasing, because that’s just an important concept in that language.</p><p>It’s not as an important concept in C++, so that’s kind of the changes that they’ve made. So, in this way we can team up, right? That’s great. We’re on the same, we’re all just players in the open source field helping each other out. But there’s always people who want to make it a competition, which one’s better? Which one am I going to use? That sort of thing.</p><p>And so, people will just find ammo to fling. And so, the obvious one that you would pick is, “Well, Rust gives you memory safety and Zig doesn’t.” And the talking point is that’s a fatal flaw. It’s 2021, we can’t have memory on safety in a modern language. I think that they just kind of missed the point. So, the way I would describe it is that Rust has a kind of like vertical memory safety approach where on the top, it’s safe. And then, on the bottom, you hit the unsafe block, and it’s not safe, right?</p><p>Let’s acknowledge that Rust is also unsafe because it has unsafe blocks in it at the bottom layer. Zig is more of I would say horizontal safety approach. So, there’s no unsafe blocks where it’s all contained in, but each feature of the language models safety in a different way.</p><h2 id="pointers-in-zig-and-rust"><strong>Pointers in Zig and Rust</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>So, as an example, the pointer type in Zig actually can represent alignment. In Rust, if you want to mess with pointer alignment, you have to use an unsafe block and you’ve turned off safety for alignment.</p><p>In Zig, you have pointer alignment in the type. So, it’s actually completely safe, and in Rust it’s not.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Okay, pointers. This is a really cool example. So, pointers and C are just raw memory addresses. Just integers that tell you where to look in memory, and you can screw them up in a lot of ways. A pointer can be null. It can be incorrectly aligned and so on. Raw pointers leading to buffer overflows are responsible for many security problems, but pointers are also super useful. Certain system calls, you can’t make them without pointers.</p><p>So, Zig works to make pointers safer. It can’t be null. They have to be optional instead. They know about alignment and so on. Rust has a different strategy. Rust keeps pointers mainly the same as C, but it puts them in unsafe blocks and says, “You really shouldn’t be using these. We have the borrow checker. Zig could have taken this unsafe keyword approach.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I mean if we did that, it would just kind of be Rust. I think this question is also asking why not add a borrow checker? And the answer is Zig also wants to be optimal and optimal means you want to fully use the hardware that you have. So, my hardware lets me use virtual memory and it lets me use intrusive data structures. And it lets me write code in a certain way that’s the most efficient way to use all the CPU and all the memory. So, if my language doesn’t let me use all my hardware features, it’s not optimal.</p><h2 id="undefined-behavior-in-zig"><strong>Undefined Behavior in Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Another way to think about this is Zig is less ambitious, intentionally. It’s a smaller language. It’s what if C were better? And one place you can see this is with the handling of undefined behavior.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I think undefined behavior is a misunderstood beast. So, a lot of people think it’s just a crime like, “Why does it exist? It was a mistake to ever have it in the language.” But I think it’s actually a tool. I’ll give you an example. Integer overflow is a simple example.</p><p>So, you can define it so that if you overflow 64-bit integer, it wraps. That’s one way to do it. Now, you don’t have undefined behavior. Okay, but now if you add something in your code and it overflows, and you didn’t expect it to, now you have a bug. And this is a really contrived example, but let’s say it’s like the bank balance or something, and you just went from like a million dollars to zero or something like that.</p><p>That’s a critical bug that happened because of well-defined behavior, whereas if we make integer overflow for just the regular plus operator undefined, then we can compile the program in a safe mode that doesn’t allow it and crashes if it happens. And that’s what you get and debug and release safe builds of Zig.</p><p>So, my point is that undefined behavior lets you catch bugs. And also, let’s say that you had this code now and you’ve tested it. It’s battle tested. It’s done. It’s like some low-level library… No one’s reported a bug in it for 10 years. We’re done working on it, right? It’s finished. It’s like the mp3 encoder or something.</p><p>Now, you can compile it in a different mode and instead of putting a safety check in for the undefined behavior, now we tell the compiler, “Assume that will never happen, and now if it did happen it would be undefined behavior.” But because we know that there’s no bugs, we can actually generate much better code assuming that the undefined behavior will never happen.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, in Zig, if you’re not doing the fastest build then you’re always asserting that this won’t overflow and you crash if that’s the case.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. Exactly.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>And that’s better than setting that person’s account to a million from a million to zero or whatever.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>That is in accordance with the Zig philosophy, yes.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>If you’re running in your kind of release mode, you won’t crash on it, right?</p><h2 id="release-fast-in-zig"><strong>Release Fast in Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>In release fast mode, which is unsafe, you will get actual undefined behavior. So, you might crash or you might get overflow. You might go down to zero or you might run an unrelated function.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Run an unrelated function. That sounds super scary. That’s why you don’t really want to turn off the asserts unless you’re certain that they’re not needed. I could see Andrew using this for the hot loop of his audio software, we’re missing the timing of the audio is almost as bad as crashing. The reason for being able to turn these off is for speed.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>And not only that, but by not having the checks, you’re allowing the optimizer to notice patterns that would not be there if the checks were present. So, for example, there may be the array bounds checking maybe is inside a function and by not including the checking, we were actually able to inline that function into the place of the call site. And then, because of the lack of bounds checking, it was then able to see another optimization and flatten that out. It can have snowballing effects to not have these extra checks in there.</p><h2 id="forking-zig"><strong>Forking Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, while Andrew is pushing Zig forward, trying to tell people that undefined behavior is a tool, not a crime, something bad happens.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, yeah, this story, huh? Yeah. We had this character come in, and at first, he just seemed a really enthusiastic contributor. He did a lot of help with his pull requests, but I didn’t mind. I would just kind of throw in a couple commits, some fix ups, and just merge it, and say, “Yeah, good enough. I’ll help you with the rest.”</p><p>But then all of a sudden, he just blew up at some kind of language decisions. He created a commercial fork, translated the documentation to Japanese, and then if you downloaded it, all the files were just the Zig files, but he just changed the extension to zen.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>But he was a contributor to a certain extent?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>It said in something I read that other contributors left with him.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I think that’s not an accurate way to put it, because it implies that there was like some kind of controversy, but what actually happened was that just that one person… This guy’s name is [inaudible 00:37:20]. The thing that actually happened was that just he just got pissed and left and no one else left, but then he offered actual money to one of the core contributors of Zig, and that person accepted the job and started working on the fork.</p><p>So, that’s what happened. And you know what? Fair, because at that point, we didn’t have the Zig Software Foundation yet. We couldn’t offer any money to core contributors. You got to put food on your table, so I really… I don’t even blame them for taking it. They got to probably improve their resume and work on something more fun and get some more money. Fine.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, were there people in Japan who are paying for a fork of Zig?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I really don’t know. Honestly, this guy is a total weirdo. It’s like he’s the kind of person where they’ll share conspicuous photos of themselves, shaking hand with some important person. And then, you’re like, “What? What’s going on? What did you do with that person?” And it’s like, “Oh, we had like a business deal, business transaction.”</p><p>It’s like, “Well, what? What did you do?” And then, it’s all show. A super weirdo guy. I don’t even know how to explain it. I’m not giving you a good synopsis of the story, but let me be clear about this. Commercially forking Zig is fine. It’s MIT-licensed. Like go for it. You’re supposed to give, supposed to just acknowledge in the license that it’s a fork.</p><p>If you just take a file that’s Zig code, and you rename the extension, you have to keep the MIT license in there. That’s fine. Go for it. But what they did with the fork was like be very tricky about it, right? So, they actually deleted the license file, put their own license in it and made it look like you had to pay for the software. So, they put like, “Oh, this is licensed by our company’s license and you have to pay $100 a year or something for it.”</p><p>So, they were deceiving people. That was the problem with what they were doing. As long as you don’t trick people, you’re welcome to do a commercial fork of Zig.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Legally it’s fine to fork Zig. It’s allowed as part of the license, but it feels a bit wrong to me. Andrew built this and he deserves some credit for creating it, and if I were Andrew and I left my job to work full-time on this project. And now, had just been forked by a commercial company, I would have freaked out. Andrew is much more calm though.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Honestly, it was more of a curiosity for me. I wasn’t ever worried about it, but I was definitely kind of just curious about, what is this guy’s motive? Didn’t seem like a effective strategy that he was taking.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>The thing that strikes me as strange is like stealing something that’s free, and then trying to sell it. I guess that’s not totally what’s happening, but it’s sort of what’s happening.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>People don’t tend to pay for programming languages right now that often I guess.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Right. Right.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>I mean it’s possible that he was on to something.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>He was onto something in the sense that he translated the documentation, and then it became accessible to people who didn’t speak English. A lot of countries don’t have a big enough, like I don’t know cultural impact on the world that they can get away with not speaking English. So, in that way, English is one of the like lingua francas of technology for better or worse, but China, Japan, Russia are big enough that you can just be someone who only speaks those languages.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>This language barrier is the heart of the issue, but the Zig team had a solution for that.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>We put out a little blog post just kind of explaining, “Hey, this other, this thing that you’re paying for, you can get it for free over here if you want. We’re sorry we don’t have the translation of the docs yet, hopefully we can get that soon.” And I think after that blog post… We got that blog post translated into Japanese. And I think that once people saw that and it went around they realized, “Oh, okay, it’s better to just get it from the upstream rather than go for this guy.”</p><h2 id="the-opposite-of-imposter-syndrome"><strong>The Opposite of Imposter Syndrome</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>It’s strange how this stuff, it doesn’t faze Andrew. Of course, I can improve upon C, of course, I could take on a commercial fork. People have talked to death the imposter syndrome, but this is the opposite. Andrew is just very assertive and confident in what he can accomplish.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>From the very beginning, my attitude was, “Let’s fucking do this. Let’s go. I’m not fooling around.” When you first make a project, obviously, you’re not unique, you’re not a unicorn. A lot of people made a programming language that’s not impressive, that’s not interesting. So, people are calling it a toy language at the very beginning.</p><p>And that’s good. I just let it slide. Part of the job I have to do is marketing and getting people to be excited about it. So, I know that having a reputation of a toy language in the beginning is okay and I’m not going to fight about it. But in my head I was thinking, “Oh, just wait. This ain’t no toy.”</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That’s awesome. I love that. If you were going to run a marathon a lot of people have a goal to finish the marathon I guess, but you’re like, “I’m going to win it.”</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>And take down C.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Let’s go. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I do feel like I have a sense for like what’s cool and what’s kind of cringy. If your posts make it under Reddit or something. And so, I definitely have been very conscious about, how am I going to come off to people so that I don’t seem like too arrogant and too big for his britches or something even though I am?</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Yeah. Because in the back of your head you’re like, “Yeah. We’re taking down C.” But you’re like, I’m just going to… Let’s get people slowly introduced to this concept.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yeah. Exactly.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-zig"><strong>The Future of Zig</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>What does the world look like when you take down C like?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Oh, it’s beautiful. It looks mostly the same, except all your apps just work slightly better, and they just crash less often, and they use less memory, and they just go faster. When professors teach operating system courses, it’ll just be like obviously assumed that you just use Zig. That’s not the focus. That’s just the setting when textbooks try to do how operating systems work or how embedded devices work, it’ll just be like assumed that you’re going to use Zig as the example code, because that’s just what everyone does.</p><p>The world won’t really be that much different, it’ll just be just a better programming experience for everyone. So, in one sense I have a lot of ambition because I am trying to dethrone this entrenched player, but on the other sense, Zig is not actually a super ambitious language. It’s just trying to take it to the next level of faster, less memory, less bugs, better development experience, better end user experience. Just a little bit better.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>So, it’s just an incremental improvement on C?</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>Yep. So, that’s kind of the yin-yang of ambition there.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>There’s no vision of you accepting your Turing award and… Yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>No. Everyone will just be like a little less stressed in their daily lives as a programmer. That’s it.</p><h2 id="advice-for-open-source-developers"><strong>Advice for Open Source Developers</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>Andrew is five years into building Zig and five years is a long time and Zig is more than just him now. The Zig Software Foundation is now supporting other full-time employees, and this is all through donations. Andrew has some tips for self-funding your own open source projects.</p><p><strong>Andrew:</strong>I think that there’s no better time than now for people who’s trying to make a living in an unconventional way. My advice is do it because you love it and don’t be afraid to put yourself out there on the crowdfunding platforms and ask for tips and don’t expect overnight success. I also think that people do want a, they want something to believe in, right?</p><p>I think with early days of Zig the feeling that I was kind of offering was, we’re going to take on C, right? This is an ambitious project, but I’m here to stick with it. I’m here to pull it off. Let’s go. Let’s do this. And that was a vibe people can get on board with.</p><p>Let’s do this. Let’s go.</p><h2 id="putting-out-my-tip-jar"><strong>Putting Out My Tip Jar</strong></h2><p><strong>Adam:</strong>That was the show. I find Andrew to be a very inspiring person. So, it’s time for me to put out my own tip jar. <strong>If you go to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/adamgordonbell">patreon.com/adamgordonbell</a>, you can find the patreon page for the podcast</strong>, and if you are enjoying these episodes and want me to keep putting more time into them, think about setting up a recurring donation.</p><p>It takes me a lot of time to make each episode, and that’s why I’m only able to make one a month right now. So, if you want to support the show, check it out. I’ll put a link in the show notes and on the webpage as well.</p><p>Until next time, let’s do this. Let’s go or sorry. I mean thank you so much for listening.</p>

      <title>Facebook reportedly researching ways to use encrypted WhatsApp messages for ads</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_macrumors_com_2021_08_03_facebook-researching-analyzing-encrypted-data_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2021/08/03/facebook-researching-analyzing-encrypted-data/"><p>Facebook is researching ways to analyze encrypted data, such as WhatsApp messages, without actually decrypting the information, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-researchers-hope-to-bring-together-two-foes-encryption-and-ads">new report from <em>The Information</em></a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This specific field of research is called &#34;homomorphic encryption,&#34; which is hoped to allow companies to read information from encrypted sets of data while also preserving privacy to protect against cybersecurity threats. Facebook has advertised several related job roles on its website, noting that it wants to work on privacy-preserving technologies while &#34;simultaneously expanding the efficiency of Facebook&#39;s market-leading advertising systems.&#34;<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The company continues to recruit researchers with backgrounds in privacy-related technologies including homomorphic encryption, secure computation and data anonymization, according to job advertisements on its website. The technologies are aimed at preserving privacy while &#34;simultaneously expanding the efficiency of Facebook&#39;s market-leading advertising systems.&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has famously been the subject of scrutiny from lawmakers and members of the public over its privacy practices. <em>The Information</em> believes that homomorphic encryption could be Facebook&#39;s response to growing concerns over user privacy and its relation to the platform&#39;s business model of running ads.<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>For Facebook, homomorphic encryption could offer a way to continue to make money from ads that are targeted based on what it knows about individual users while also answering calls from lawmakers to take privacy more seriously and prevent the misuse or breach of its data. And it could aid the company&#39;s effort to make money from WhatsApp, whose messages are encrypted, meaning Facebook can&#39;t use them to target ads.</p>
<p>Facebook has considered a workaround to target ads to WhatsApp users in the meantime, but homomorphic encryption could allow Facebook to analyze the data without actually reading it or sharing it directly with advertisers.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson told <em>The Information</em> that it is &#34;too early for us to consider homomorphic encryption for WhatsApp at this time.&#34; The timing of Facebook&#39;s apparent ramp-up of research into new ways to target ads to users through their WhatsApp messages comes not long after Apple&#39;s rollout of ATT or App Tracking Transparency.</p>
<p>ATT is a framework on iOS 14.5 and later that requires that all apps to ask for user&#39;s consent before tracking them across other apps and websites. Facebook had been a vocal critic of the framework in the weeks leading up to its official launch; however, after its rollout, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it has had little impact on his company&#39;s performance so far.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, has <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1422611553954668546">tweeted in response</a> to <em>The Information&#39;s</em> report that WhatsApp is not exploring the use of homomorphic encryption. Cathcart states that there should be skepticism of &#34;technical claims that apps like ours could see messages in &#34;good&#34; cases only.&#34; </p>

<p><strong>MalbolgeLisp</strong> is a LISP interpreter written in Malbolge. It&#39;s as of 2020 and 2021, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge#Programming_in_Malbolge" rel="nofollow">the most advanced, usable Malbolge program ever created</a>. It supports everything LISPs generally tend to support (like <code>cond</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>lambda</code>, etc...). The v1.1 release greatly improved the performance and reduced the code size, while adding a few features.</p>

Why is it difficult?</h2>
<p><strong>Malbolge</strong> is a public domain esoteric programming language. It was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive &#39;crazy operation&#39;, trinary arithmetic, and self-modifying code. It builds on the difficulty of earlier, challenging esoteric languages like Brainfuck, but takes this aspect to the extreme. Despite this design, it is possible to write useful Malbolge programs (as this project proves).</p>
<p>What Malbolge instructions do depends on their position in the source code. After being ran, they are encrypted (so to make a loop, one has to decrypt it after each iteration - sounds hard already?). This is how so-called instruction cycles have been discovered - it has been observed that some instructions on certain locations form looping cycles, which is the basis of Malbolge programming.</p>
<p>The most complex programs made in Malbolge, to date, include an adder, a &#34;99 bottles of beer&#34; program, and a &#34;Hello, world!&#34; program (originally generated by a Lisp program utilizing a genetic algorithm).</p>
<p>MalbolgeLisp uses a special variant of Malbolge called <strong>Malbolge Unshackled</strong>. It&#39;s considerably harder to program for multiple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The rotation width is chosen randomly by the interpreter</li>
<li>Malbolge Unshackled lets the width of rotation be variable, which grows with the values in the D register, and since the initial rotation width is unknown, you have to probe it (because otherwise <code>*</code> returns unpredictable results)</li>
<li>Malbolge Unshackled&#39;s print instruction requires unicode codepoints</li>
<li>if the rotation width is unknown then you can&#39;t load values larger than 3^4-1, except values starting with a <code>1</code> trit</li>
<li>to overcome this you need a loop that probes the rotation width which is probably beyond most people&#39;s comprehension</li>
<li>the specification says that the value <code>0t21</code> should be used to print a newline, but this value is <em>theoretically</em> impossible to obtain without having read an end of line or end of file from I/O before.</li>
<li>Malbolge Unshackled is actually usable because it&#39;s (as this project proves) Turing complete. The default Malbolge rotation width (10) constraints the addressable memory enough to make something cool with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few example Malbolge programs:</p>
<p>A &#34;Hello World&#34; program:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(=&lt;`#9]~6ZY327Uv4-QsqpMn&amp;+Ij&#34;&#39;E%e{Ab~w=_:]Kw%o44Uqp0/Q?xNvL:`H%c#DD2^WV&gt;gY;dts76qKJImZkj

</code></pre></div>
<p>A cat program that doesn&#39;t terminate on EOF:</p>

<p>The release bundle includes interpreter binaries for Windows (x64, one is optimized for memory consumption and one for speed), and a few interpreters for Linux (the names should be self explanatory, also x64). If you&#39;re not running a x64 machine, you&#39;ll have to compile <code>fast20.c</code> yourself. From my observations, the best results were yielded by GCC and the code has been tuned to perform well when compiled with it. <code>malbolgelisp-v1.1.mb</code> is the source code for the interpreter.</p>

<p>After you start the interpreter, you should be greeted with a banner (containing the version, dot commands, etc..). The following dot commands are currently available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.F</code> - display all the features recognized by the interpreter</li>
<li><code>.A</code> - display the information about the interpreter&#39;s author</li>
<li><code>.R</code> - reset the memory</li>
<li><code>.M</code> - display the information about memory consumption</li>
<li>Any other command (and sending EOF - ^Z on Windows, ^D on UNIXes
will terminate the interpreter).</li>
</ul>
<p>After entering an expression (for example - <code>(+ 2 2)</code>), the interpreter should print something akin to this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (+ 2 2)
   ..............|.....
   4
   %
"><pre><code>   % (+ 2 2)
   ..............|.....
   4
   %
</code></pre></div>
<p>The dots are used to signal that the code is being parsed (before the pipe character) or evaluated (after the pipe character). The amount of dots doesn&#39;t correspond to any consistent amount of time.</p>

<p>In MalbolgeLISP, you can introduce constants using the <code>define</code> function. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (define x 5)
   ................|..
   5
   % (+ x 1)
   ................|.....
   6
"><pre><code>   % (define x 5)
   ................|..
   5
   % (+ x 1)
   ................|.....
   6
</code></pre></div>
<p>MalbolgeLISP also supports lexically scoped (a function sees its lexical ancestor&#39;s environment, not its callers) lambdas. For instance:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % ((lambda (n) (* n n)) 3)
   ........................................|.........
   9
   % ((lambda (m) ((lambda (n) (+ m n)) 2)) 2)
   ........................................................|.............
   4
"><pre><code>   % ((lambda (n) (* n n)) 3)
   ........................................|.........
   9
   % ((lambda (m) ((lambda (n) (+ m n)) 2)) 2)
   ........................................................|.............
   4
</code></pre></div>
<p>How to define functions then? Well, a logical conclusion can be drawn from the examples above:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (define succ (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
   .............................................|..
   (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
   % (succ 2)
   ...........|.........
   3
"><pre><code>   % (define succ (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))
   .............................................|..
   (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
   % (succ 2)
   ...........|.........
   3
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because <code>define lambda</code> is a bit annoying to type each time and doesn&#39;t look good, we can use a nicer syntax for that - <code>defun</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (defun succ (x) (+ x 1))
   .....................................|.
   (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
   % (succ 2)
   ...........|.........
   3
"><pre><code>   % (defun succ (x) (+ x 1))
   .....................................|.
   (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
   % (succ 2)

<p>The equals function (<code>=</code>) also works on atoms and lists. Lists have to be quoted to prevent the interpreter from evaluating them:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (= test test)
   ..................|......
   1
   % (= &#39;(1 2 3) &#39;(1 2 3))

   % (= &#39;(1 2 3) &#39;(1 2 3))
   ..................................|.........
   1
   %
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>iota</code> function generates natural numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>N-1</code> (inclusive). For instance:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (iota 5)
   ...........|....
   (0 1 2 3 4)
"><pre><code>   % (iota 5)
   ...........|....
   (0 1 2 3 4)
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>size</code> yields the size of a list passed as an argument. Using <code>size</code> and <code>iota</code>, we can make a really inefficient identity function for numbers:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (defun id (x) (size (iota x)))

<p><code>nth</code> yields the N-th element of a list. It uses the same indexing as <code>iota</code>, as demonstrated below:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (nth 3 (iota 5))
   ......................|........
   3
"><pre><code>   % (nth 3 (iota 5))
   ......................|........
   3
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s try using atoms now. We can print an atom or a list using <code>print</code>, and we can check if something is an atom using the <code>atom</code> function. Note that <code>print</code> is an identity function with a side effect of printing an expression&#39;s value:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (atom null)
   ...........|....
   1
   % (atom &#39;(1 2 3))
   .....................|....
   0
   % (print hello)
   .............|....
   hello

   hello
   % (print &#39;(1 2 3))
   .....................|....
   (1 2 3)

   (1 2 3)
   %
"><pre><code>   % (atom null)
   ...........|....
   1
   % (atom &#39;(1 2 3))
   .....................|....
   0
   % (print hello)
   .............|....
   hello

   hello
   % (print &#39;(1 2 3))
   .....................|....
   (1 2 3)

   (1 2 3)
   %
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s look at how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> work. <code>car</code> takes the head (first element) of a list, and <code>cdr</code> takes the tail (everything <em>except</em> the first element) of a list:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (define list &#39;(1 2 3))
   ..........................|..
   (1 2 3)
   % (car list)
   .............|....
   1
   % (cdr list)
   .............|....
   (2 3)
"><pre><code>   % (define list &#39;(1 2 3))
   ..........................|..
   (1 2 3)
   % (car list)
   .............|....
   1
   % (cdr list)
   .............|....
   (2 3)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, <code>cons</code> can be used to prepend something to a list. Like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (cons 3 &#39;(1 2))
   .....................|.....
   (3 1 2)
"><pre><code>   % (cons 3 &#39;(1 2))
   .....................|.....
   (3 1 2)

<p>The <code>if</code> function requires exactly 3 parameters - the condition, the expression to evaluate if the condition is true, and the expression to evaluate if the condition is false. A small example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (defun gt10 (x) (if (&gt; x 10) (print yes) (print no)))
   .......................................................................|.
   (lambda (x) (if (&gt; x 10) (print yes) (print no)))
   % (gt10 5)
   ...........|...............
   no

   no
   % (gt10 16)
   ...........|...............
   yes

   yes
"><pre><code>   % (defun gt10 (x) (if (&gt; x 10) (print yes) (print no)))
   .......................................................................|.
   (lambda (x) (if (&gt; x 10) (print yes) (print no)))
   % (gt10 5)
   ...........|...............
   no

   no
   % (gt10 16)
   ...........|...............
   yes

   yes
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you need a lot of <code>if</code>s in one place, you can consider using <code>cond</code>. It takes a list of lists <code>(condition result)</code>, optionally including a <code>(result)</code> list. Using <code>cond</code>, we can make a three-way-comparison function (that returns <code>2 1 0</code> for <code>&gt; = &lt;</code>):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (defun &lt;=&gt; (x y) (cond ((&gt; x y) 2) ((&lt; x y) 0) (1)))
   ....................................................................................|.
   (lambda (x y) (cond ((&gt; x y) 2) ((&lt; x y) 0) (1)))
   % (&lt;=&gt; 5 6)
   ..............|.....................
   0
"><pre><code>   % (defun &lt;=&gt; (x y) (cond ((&gt; x y) 2) ((&lt; x y) 0) (1)))
   ....................................................................................|.
   (lambda (x y) (cond ((&gt; x y) 2) ((&lt; x y) 0) (1)))
   % (&lt;=&gt; 5 6)
   ..............|.....................
   0
</code></pre></div>
<p>The final builtin function is <code>let</code>. It allows us to bind names to expressions (so that they&#39;re not re-evaluated at a later time). For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   % (let (x 5 y 6) (+ x y))
   .............................................|.............
   11
"><pre><code>   % (let (x 5 y 6) (+ x y))

<hr/>



This article addresses the joys, challenges, and some practical aspects
of retiring young.  The author retired in 2001, at the age of 37 (same
age as Rossini when he retired).

<h3>The Depressing Truth</h3>

Ask a wage slave what he&#39;d like to accomplish.  Chances are the response
will be something like &#34;I&#39;d start every day at the gym and work out for
two hours until I was as buff as Brad Pitt.  Then I&#39;d practice the piano
for three hours.  I&#39;d become fluent in Mandarin so that I could be
prepared to understand the largest transformation of our time.  I&#39;d
really learn how to handle a polo pony.  I&#39;d learn to fly a helicopter.
I&#39;d finish the screenplay that I&#39;ve been writing and direct a production
of it in HDTV.&#34;

<p>

Why hasn&#39;t he accomplished all of those things? &#34;Because I&#39;m chained to
this desk 50 hours per week at this horrible
[insurance|programming|government|administrative|whatever] job.

</p><p>

So he has no doubt that he would get all these things done if he didn&#39;t
have to work?  &#34;Absolutely none.  If I didn&#39;t have the job, I would be
out there living the dream.&#34;

</p><p>

Suppose that the guy cashes in his investments and does retire.  What do
we find?  He is waking up at 9:30 am, surfing the Web, sorting out the
cable TV bill, watching DVDs, talking about going to the gym, eating
Doritos, and maybe accomplishing <em>one</em> of his stated goals.

</p><p>

Retirement forces you to stop thinking that it is your job that holds
you back.  For most people the depressing truth is that they aren&#39;t that
organized, disciplined, or motivated.

</p><h3>Be Happy or You&#39;re a Loser</h3>

In olden times, the average person didn&#39;t expect to be happy.  Life
could be a struggle for survival with hard work and adversity at every
corner.  Marriages were arranged by parents and if, after 20 years, the
couple hated each other, there was no option to divorce.

<p>

This article is written primarily for Americans.  We have &#34;pursuit of
happiness&#34; written right into our Declaration of Independence.  A
working person, however, does not expect to be happy all the time.
Every job has unpleasant elements and drudgery.  The working person
imagines that if he didn&#39;t have to work, he would be happy 24/7.  It
would be like going to Disneyland every day.

</p><p>

Suppose that you are retired.  At this point, your one job is the
pursuit of happiness.  If you are not happy, therefore you are a failure
at your job and in your life.  But how can you be happy 24/7?  Perhaps
if you moved into a hotel in Orlando and went to Disneyworld every day
you would be pretty happy.  But if you retain the responsibilities of
home- and car-ownership, much of your life will continue to be mundane,
boring, or unpleasant.  Will you wear a big smile on your face as you
change the lightbulbs in the hall?  Will you be delighted paying bills
or begging the plumber to come over and fix the shower?  Will you be
ecstatic when it comes time to get your car inspected?

</p><p>

The idle rich in the old days were truly idle.  They had servants, and
butlers to supervise those servants.  Unless you are retiring today with
$50 million or more, however, you probably aren&#39;t rich enough to live in
a cocoon.  You still end up running the same errands that you ran when
you were a wage slave, but now they stick out more.  The errands aren&#39;t
keeping you from attending a boring meeting at work; they&#39;re keeping you
from a fun horse-riding or helicopter-flying lesson.

</p><h3>Interaction with Other Humans</h3>

Most jobs come with a social life.  You show up to work.  You have
casual conversations throughout the day with a variety of people, most
of whom you know and many of whom you like.  If all you do when you go
home at night is sit and read or watch TV by yourself, you&#39;re still a
reasonably social person.  When you retire, however, this built-in
social life goes away.

<p>

If you&#39;ve got a spouse and kids, you&#39;re all set.  You&#39;ll spend enough of
your day talking to other people.  If you&#39;re single, however, be aware
that you will need to create a social life.  This can be tough in many
parts of the country and with your existing friends.  Your friends who
have jobs aren&#39;t available during the day and, most of the time, will be
too tired in the evening to get together.

</p><p>

The author has been personally fortunate in several respects.  First,
his preretirement apartment is located in near Harvard Square in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  This neighborhood is full of interesting
people, such as graduate students, with flexible schedules.  Second,
several years before retiring he adopted a Samoyed puppy.  Walking
around town and into shops with a Samoyed is a guaranteed way to start a
casual conversation.  It might be limited to &#34;What kind of dog is he?
What&#39;s his name?  How old?&#34; but it seems to be sufficient to stave off
the feeling of solitary confinement.  Third, the author took up flying
as a hobby and general aviation seems to involve a lot of middle-aged
guys goofing off and hanging around. (see <a href="https://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/early-retirement/aviation">this
separate page on &#34;Aviation for Retired Guys (and Gals)&#34;</a>)

</p><p>

One strategy that might be effective is to spend every Sunday night
planning activities for the week.  As your friends get older, it becomes
more difficult to arrange dinner parties and other get-togethers.  They
just don&#39;t have the energy or inclination to hang out like they did in
college or just after.

</p><h3>Travel: No to the Beach; Yes to the Organized Tour</h3>

<a href="https://philip.greenspun.com/images/200404-ecuador-peru/200405-machu-picchu/tour-group-on-balcony-2.tcl"></a>

One of the great things about retirement is the freedom to travel and
explore new parts of the world.  Should you take the trips that you
dreamed of when you were working?  Maybe not.  When you worked 50 weeks
per year, the idea of sitting on a beach by yourself with a stack of
novels might have seemed an appealing escape from the crush of
interaction that afflicted you on every working day.  In retirement,
however, you&#39;re free to sit in your living room by yourself every day
and read novels.  Nobody is going to disturb you.  Why go to the trouble
of getting on an airplane if that is all you want to do?

<p>

An ideal retirement trip might be one in which you learn some new skills
and have built-in interaction with people.  The author enjoyed a 10-day
trip to Panama, for example, in which he took helicopter lessons on
most of the days.  There was some sightseeing, of course, but not the
same old &#34;Where else have you been in Central America&#34; sorts of
conversations that pure tourists have.  The organized tour that appalled
you during your working life might be just right now that you&#39;re
retired.  You&#39;ll be sightseeing but also getting to know some
potentially interesting new people.

</p><p>

Remember that travel can be hard work, especially if you&#39;re doing the
planning yourself.  Some experienced travelers plan a day or two each
week in which they &#34;take a day off&#34; from traveling.  They don&#39;t move to
a new city.  They don&#39;t sightsee.  They might do laundry or other
errands.

</p><h3>Non-profits are NOT the Answer</h3>

You were probably able to retire young because you are vastly more able
than the average person.  Now should be an ideal time to find a
non-profit organization whose goals you share.  You would expect them to
be delighted at your offer to pitch in as a volunteer, bringing the
skills that enabled you to start and grow a profitable enterprise.

<p>

Let&#39;s start with a story.  Back in ancient times, I worked at an
open-source enterprise software company.  We had about $20 million per
year in revenue and, even after paying out $3 million in
year-end bonuses to the programmers, we had at least $3 million left over in
pure taxable profit.  So we looked for opportunities to do some
non-profit work.  One of our customers was the MIT Sloan business
school.  They wanted an information system to coordinate all
student-teacher and student-student interaction in their classes.
Basically the system, dubbed &#34;Sloan Space&#34;, covered all the IT needs of
the school except for accounting.  Sloan Space kept track of who was in
a class, who was teaching a class, what the assignments were and when
they were due, the submission and grading of assignments, private
discussion forums for each class, and everything else that the Sloan
staff decided that an online community of MBA students needed.

</p><p>

Sloan wasn&#39;t paying our company as much as other clients but we found
the contract worthwhile partly because many of our employees had been
MIT students and had a sentimental attachment to the place, but mostly
because we thought that we could reuse the software and get other
universities to adopt it.  Our software was free and open-source but the
richer organizations that used it would generally pay for support and
extensions.  Universities don&#39;t pay taxes and they sometimes cry &#34;poor&#34;,
but after years of claiming to lose money on every student they somehow
end up with substantial assets. (Harvard, for example, has about $30
billion in its checking account; enough to buy at least five aircraft
carriers, complete with fighter jets.)

</p><p>

Just as Sloan was preparing to launch their system to students we heard
about a new tuition-free engineering college.  They were about a year
from taking in their first students.  We liked what they were doing and
contacted the president of the new school.  We explained our contract
with MIT Sloan and the fact that all of the software we&#39;d built for
Sloan was free and open-source and could be reused at their school.  We
offered to assign two full-time programmers, each with an MIT degree in
computer science, to the project indefinitely.  These two programmers
would extend the MIT Sloan software to meet any requirements that the
new school set forth.  Basically we would handle all of their IT needs
at no charge.  All of our software was open-source and if we disappeared
after a year they could hire the programmer of their choice to maintain
and extend it.  The president seemed delighted with this idea and turned
us over to his head of IT to work out the details.  That&#39;s where the
project stopped.  The head of IT already had a plan to hire programmers
and build a big system from scratch, working in various Microsoft
products (most of which were subsequently rewritten or discontinued)

</p><p>

Non-profit organizations exist to provide their staff with great jobs
and the fun of making decisions and spending money.  The folks who work
at a non-profit organization are very interested in drawing a salary
higher than their skills and working hours would command at a for-profit
enterprise subject to competition.  They are not especially interested
in efficiency or accomplishment.  If you&#39;ve come from the commercial
world, in which McDonald&#39;s must be ruthlessly efficient for fear of
being destroyed by Burger King, working with or in the typical
non-profit organization will likely drive you to insanity.

</p><p>

Once word gets around town that you are retired, non-profit orgs will
start rattling your cage.  Whatever your IQ, education, certifications,
and skills might be, the assumption will be that you are past it, a
doddering old fool incapable of doing more than writing a check.  If you
believe in their mission, however, it doesn&#39;t make sense to write them a
check.  Donating money to charity is great for busy people with jobs and
the obscenely wealthy who are maintaining their social status with
displays of spending surplus cash.  As an early retiree, however, your
comparative wealth is mostly in the time that you can choose to spare.
If the non-profit organization can&#39;t come up with a way to use your
brains, skills, and time, tell them to get their cash from the
time-starved working rich and the multi-billionaires.

</p><p>

Most important, do not retire in the expectation that it will be easy to
find rewarding non-profit volunteer work.

</p><p>

(If you aren&#39;t sufficiently discourage by the foregoing, read <a href="https://philip.greenspun.com/non-profit/">my ideas for new non-profit projects</a>.)

</p><h3>Teaching might be the answer</h3>

Volunteering as a teacher has proven very rewarding for many early
retirees.  People like teaching for a variety of reasons.  One is that
the traditional lecture course provides a venue in which people are
forced to listen to the teacher.  If ambitious working people no longer
care to hear what you have to say, at least students who don&#39;t want to
fail the class will listen.  A more powerful reason is that talking to
young people is an activity that matters.  If you are talking to someone
over the age of 40 about life decisions, chances are that you both are
simply wasting breath and killing time.  You can talk about how great it
would be to live on the other coast or up in Alaska but both of you are
so tied down by a web of obligations from friends and family that it
will never happen.  A young person graduating from college, on the other
hand, is almost certain to choose a new career and move to a new city.
Input that you provide on these subjects could be critical to their
future happiness.


<h3>Tattoo Your Net Worth on Your Forehead...</h3>

... otherwise folks will greatly overestimate your wealth.  If someone
at a party asks you what you do and you answer &#34;retired&#34;, if you appear
to be under the age of 50, almost always they will greatly overestimate
your wealth.  Americans cannot imagine stopping work before they&#39;ve
either (1) purchased everything that they could conceivably want, or (2)
collapsed from physical exhaustion.  The magazine <a href="http://www.elite-traveler.com"><cite>Elite Traveler</cite></a>,
distributed free to airport general aviation lounges where corporate
looters alight, depicts the lifestyle to which Americans aspire.  A
watch costs $30,000, a survey of hotel accommodations in Mexico or New
Orleans shows suites ranging in price from $3,000 to $20,000, getting
from point A to point B costs $5,000 per hour in a private jet, partying
for a week involves chartering a yacht for $200,000.  These costs are no
problems for the readers of <cite>Elite Traveler</cite> because (a) most
of them are borne by the shareholders of the public companies for which
they work, and (b) the median annual income of an <cite>Elite
Traveler</cite> reader is over $1 million (see their media kit online).
When you say &#34;I&#39;m retired&#34; the other person at the party hears &#34;Even
without working anymore, I can afford to live the <cite>Elite
Traveler</cite> lifestyle.&#34;

<p>

Suppose that you say, for example, that you can&#39;t make firm travel plans
because your little airplane doesn&#39;t have a turbine engine and deicing
equipment and therefore you&#39;re very dependent on the weather.  Folks
will ask &#34;Why don&#39;t you get a Gulfstream and blast through the clouds at
4,000 feet-per-minute with the same engines that power a Boeing 737?&#34;
It becomes a little awkward to admit that you&#39;re approximately $50
million short of the $50 million required to join Jack Welch in the
flight levels (of course Mr. Welch, despite being retired, doesn&#39;t pay
for his use of a GE business jet, the fuel, or the pilots; the public
shareholders of GE do).

</p><p>

An answer that brings the conversation back down to earth is to remind
your interlocutor of all the older folks he or she might know who are
retired.  They aren&#39;t rich, are they?  They have enough money, one
hopes, to live in a comfortable house and do the things that they most
enjoy, not enough money to gratify every conceivable material desire.

<h3>Giving Money to Children (While Still Alive)</h3>

What&#39;s a good way to give money to kids without spoiling them?
My idea: For every dollar they earn, give them $N. That way they have to
work, but they don&#39;t have to work a repulsive yuppie job to enjoy
a comfortable lifestyle.  The main objection to this approach is that it
is tax-inefficient.  If the kid earns $50,000 per year doing something
he finds rewarding and you give him $150,000 that year, you have to pay
a big gift tax.  Some sort of trust fund and/or life insurance policy
that the kid can claim after you die would be more efficient.

<p>

Is an increased tax liability so bad?  Not for the truly rich.  These
guys intend to give most of their wealth away to non-profit
organizations.  The federal government funds roads and airports that we
all enjoy using.  The feds pay for health care for the poor and the old.
Our tax dollars pay for intrepid military personnel who go out and kill
angry foreigners (in most cases) before they can arrive on U.S. soil and
kill Americans here at home.  For a non-profit organization of its size,
the federal government is surprisingly efficient.  Most federal
employees work in big box-like office buildings, not in $300 million
monuments to an architect&#39;s ego.  George W. Bush gets paid only $400,000
per year, less than half of what a lot of university presidents earn.

</p><p>

Can we tweak the $N bonus idea at all?  What if a kid becomes a
repulsive yuppie despite the lack of financial necessity?  Won&#39;t
his siblings become envious when Chad, Jr. gets a $3 million check
from Chad, Sr. to supplement his $1 million/year earnings at
J.P. Morgan?  Perhaps there should be a sliding scale for the bonus
where the first $100,000/year is muliplied by 4, the next $100,000 by
3, the next $100,000 by 2, and the rest of the kid&#39;s income is
not subject to a parental bonus.  Or there could be a lifetime cap of
$10-20 million per kid (no Gulfstream for Johnny :-( ).


</p><p>

How about tweaking the tax liability?  Perhaps the money could go first
into an irrevocable trust, but only paid out by the trustee as a
multiple of income.  I&#39;m not sure if this escapes gift/estate tax.

</p><p>

[Note: I drafted this idea at the request of a late 40s rich, but not
retired, friend.  He ended up implementing it for his teenage children.]


</p><h3>Where to Live?</h3>

This subject is sufficiently complicated to merit its own page: <a href="https://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/early-retirement/where-to-live">&#34;Choosing a place to live for
early retirees&#34;</a>.

<p>

Whatever you do, make sure that you read <a href="http://www.realworlddivorce.com"><cite>Real World
Divorce</cite></a> before settling in a state and exposing yourself to
its family law system. Moving one mile over a border could mean the
difference between losing half of your savings after a one-day
marriage and losing none, or the difference between being a parent
after a divorce and being an every-other-weekend aunt or uncle, or the
difference between paying $100,000 per year in child support or $13,000.

</p><h3>Time Management</h3>

How much work does the average college student get done?  Almost none.
Yet the same person, injected into a corporate bureaucracy, becomes a
reasonably effective worker.  Why?  Most people have terrible time
management skills.  This limitation is of no consequence in public
school.  The school tells you where to sit and what to do and when, at
least for six hours per day.  This limitation is of no consequence at
most jobs.  The employer tells the workers where to sit and what to do
and when, at least for eight hours per day.

<p>

If you&#39;re retired, however, nobody tells you how to organize your life.
If you have goals that you&#39;d like to accomplish and your time management
skills are poor, you might end up disappointed in yourself.

</p><p>

In researching this article, I ordered all of the popular books on time
management from Amazon.com, but didn&#39;t like any of them well enough to
recommend.  Here are some reasonably good ideas from the books and from
my friends:

</p><ul>

<li>make lists of the things that you want to accomplish and subtasks
toward those goals; keep these lists in prominent and convenient places
(most of the books)

</li><li>schedule lots of lessons and other things in advance so that your
days have some structure (my own; I tend to schedule flying and horse
riding lessons during the summer, for example)

</li><li>come up with a rigid scheduling spreadsheet for your days as though
you had a job, setting aside time for writing, reading, answering email,
going to the gym, etc. (my own, I drafted a spreadsheet once but never
tried living it because I was instantly ridiculed for my efforts by a
girlfriend)

</li><li>publish a public Web diary of what you do every day, thus
discouraging you from wasting time because you&#39;ll be ashamed to admit
that all you accomplished yesterday was a 15-minute oil change and a
trip to Target (my own, but never implemented)

</li><li>don&#39;t read the newspaper or email in the morning because it will
scramble your brain with lots of disconnected ideas and you won&#39;t be
able to accomplish any serious work for the rest of the day (very
productive friend who has just completed his fourth book)


</li></ul>

<h3>TIME Magazine Happiness Issue</h3>

As mentioned above, pursuit of happiness is the main goal of the early
retiree.  TIME magazine&#39;s January 17, 2005 issue contains a special
section entitled &#34;The Science of Happiness&#34;.  At least 50 percent of
happiness is genetic, so don&#39;t expect a huge change from how you felt
when working.

<p>

Some good news for early retirees:

</p><ul> 

<li>important sources of happiness are often those that require some
free time to pursue, such as spending time with children and friends

</li><li>&#34;your degree of control over your life and destiny&#34; was an important
factor as was &#34;the things you do in your leisure time&#34;

</li><li>older people are happier and less subject to depression than young
people

</li><li>reported happiness is positively correlated with income (88
percent of people earning over $100k/year say that they are happy &#34;most
or all of the time&#34; compared to just 68 percent of people earning less
than $35,000 per year), though some other studies show that this is not
a large factor once above the median income

</li></ul>

Potential bad news:  &#34;engagement and meaning are much more important
[than pleasure]&#34;.  If you don&#39;t have a job or kids, you might not be
very engaged and what you do might not have any meaning or purpose.
&#34;Cerebral virtues--curiosity, love of learning--are less strongly tied
to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude, and
the capacity for love.&#34;

<p>

Concrete steps toward more happiness:

</p><ul>

<li>keep a gratitude journal, once a week, in which you write down three
to five things for which you are current thankful

</li><li>practice acts of kindness to make yourself feel generous and capable

</li><li>thank a mentor--in detail and, if possible, in person

</li><li>write letters of forgiveness to people who have hurt or wronged you

</li><li>invest time and energy in friends and family

</li><li>sleep and exercise

</li><li>spend more time with other people (&#34;almost every person feels
happier when they&#39;re with other people,&#34; says one expert quoted in the
issue--note that this makes computer programming a particularly poor
career choice)

</li><li>laugh more (watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B00003CXPJ/pgreenspun-20">Zoolander</a> instead of a serious subtitled French movie)

</li><li>move to a country, city, or neighborhood where you are substantially
wealthier than average (being exposed to lots of richer people will make
you envious and less satisfied with whatever you have)

</li><li>move to a country where people around you are happy (East Asia
bad; Latin America good; U.S. quite good as well)

</li><li>get a dog: studies show that dog owners were happier and less
subject to depression, people were able to do difficult or unpleasant
tasks more easily and with lower blood pressure when accompanied by a
dog; dog owners get more exercise and find it more enjoyable

</li><li>(tough to fake) become a sports fan and cheer like an idiot

</li><li>(even tougher to fake) become religious, ideally Buddhist -- those
who have a lot of religious faith tend to be happier and find meaning in
life; among mainstream U.S. religions, Protestantism is good for
happiness and Judaism is bad

</li></ul>

The TIME issue is negative on marriage as a means for increasing
happiness.  Married people are happier, of course, but mostly because
they were happier and better adjusted to begin with.  TIME ignores the
fact that they previously talked about how children and grandchildren
were critical to happiness.  For most people, it is not practical to
have children outside of marriage, so it seems that people would be
happier if they stayed married at least long enough to have some kids.


<h3>Prepare to Die</h3>

Retiring young has benefits and risks to life expectancy.  You&#39;re not
sitting at a desk all day every day anymore, so you&#39;ll probably lose 10
lbs. simply by being more active.  You won&#39;t be going on business trips
and gorging yourself with expense-account meals.  On the other hand, you
now have time to ski, snowboard, skydive, whitewater raft, fly light
aircraft, travel to Africa, and engage in other risky
activities.  Best to plan for your ultimate demise.

<p>

Unless you think the government is doing such a great job building a new
and better Iraq that you want to pitch in even more, you may wish to
consider ways of avoiding estate tax.  Only the first $2 million of an
estate is currently exempt from taxes, scheduled to rise to $3.5 million
2009, be unlimited in 2010, and come back down to $1 million in 2011.
Some states collect their own estate taxes (see <a href="http://www.retirementliving.com/RLtaxes.html">http://www.retirementliving.com/RLtaxes.html</a>
for a list).  The total tax burden on an estate can be more than 50
percent.

</p><p>

The standard tools that rich families use to preserve their wealth down
through the centuries include the following:

</p><ul> 

<li>give money to a grandchild instead of a child; by skipping a
generation, the government gets only half as many opportunities to
collect estate tax (reduce estate tax by 50 percent)

</li><li>take money that you were going to give to someone upon your death
and, instead, buy a huge life insurance policy with it; when you die
they collect the proceeds of the insurance policy tax-free (reduce
estate taxes by 100 percent)

</li><li>various trusts to hold insurance proceeds and other money so that
young and/or irresponsible inheritors don&#39;t burn through the money too
fast (doesn&#39;t really save tax, but lets you control people from beyond
the grave)

</li><li>charitable foundations and organizations that are supposed to work
for the public benefit, but in fact provide jobs and luxurious vacations
(&#34;board meetings&#34;) for members of your family for decades to come; the
Enron executives were into these.  Supposedly it is illegal and the
family foundation ought to recruit employees on the open market, but in
practice people are able to say &#34;the only person we could find to review
grant applications at our family foundation was our cousin Margaret at
$100,000 per year&#34; (reduce estate taxes by 100 percent)

</li></ul>

A good lawyer can put together a package with a Will, a single trust,
and maybe an insurance policy, for about $2,000.  Even at big firms,
some of the more honest lawyers will do this work for a fixed fee.

<h3>Literature</h3>

Here are some books and movies about people who don&#39;t work.

<ul>
<h4>earned</h4>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BX8R10/pgreenspun-20">Broken Flowers</a>, the 2005 movie with Bill Murray

Girl</a>, by Steve Martin (the book, not the movie); the shop girl&#39;s
boyfriend is a mostly-retired guy whose wealth derives from &#34;a few lines
of computer code&#34;; Steve Martin has a very confused notion of how a
leftover computer nerd might live in terms of fashion and taste

<h4>inherited</h4>

		Very interesting. Most of my happiness comes from accomplishing goals (creating software products is very satisfying) or from interacting with my spouse, children, extended family and co-workers. I can imagine doing all these things in my free time if retired. I do build software on my own &#39;just for the heck of it&#39;.

		Phil, this is a great article and one that hits the heart.  I left a certain famous search company after 5 years of employment with a lot of wealth and haven&#39;t been working since.  I think there needs to be more written on this subject of &#39;now what?!&#39; and basically support for some of us young (im 36) retirees who have lost a bit of ambition and direction after leaving the rat race. 
Anyway, after reading your article, i dont feel as guilty anymore splurging on a thing or two (namely justifying buying another car), but more importanly to focus on new things and not lose confidence that you&#39;ll have the motivation to be working hard again one day.  I also never knew that being wealthy has its stigmas...ie alienation from certain friends and certain family, etc.  You really have to be creative in this situation. Keep the ideas and updates on this subject coming...

		I really like your list of how rich families preserve their wealth down to many generations; especially the suggestion on buying a huge life insurance policy and getting monthly annuity payments from it, set for life! According to this site, it is also not advised to take out a lump sum distribution from a <a href="http://www.research401k.com" target="_blank_">401k</a> because:

		Dismissing all non-profits because they exist for the benefit of the employees is just a little cynical.  When I stopped working in the corporate world (MSFT) I started working for a non-profit to educate myself and figure out if I wanted to do it long term, and have discovered a wealth of viable causes, and committed people who really are contributing to making the world (sometimes one individual at a time) a better place for the rest of us to live. Sometimes it takes a group of people with different skills to create change, whether it be locally by clearing the trails in a local park, or building a house for others, or globally, thru education and information.  However, when it comes to volunteering, be prepared to be clear about what you are offering and be willing to show up in a committed way, showing up once or twice for a couple hours probably won&#39;t be beneficial to anyone. (altho at YES! magazine, we have successfully used a seminar format to pick the brains of people, in a consulting format).

		From 2001-2004 I was a CEO of a public software company and after a major turnaround, we sold it, and I made enough to &#34;comfortably&#34; retire in my 40&#39;s.

<p>

Since then, I have had both the same joys and frustrations that you mention in your article.  I have enjoyed working out more, reading, traveling all over the world, time with friends and family.

</p><p>

Yet, like most ambitious people, I keep asking myself, &#34;Is there somethhing more?&#34;  &#34;Am I really done with my career?&#34; etc.

</p><p>

Retiring in your 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s, we will all have to come face to face with the reality that we are all so much more than our jobs, careers, status symbols captured and enjoyed.

I don&#39;t have my final answer.  I am still struggling through, &#34;Get another CEO Gig&#34; or &#34;Fully pursue all my other passions in life&#34;.

		I&#39;m getting ready to retire fairly early- 53- not through having made a killing in the stock market or working 60-80 hours a week or being in a fabulous Internet startup, but by simply living below my means, maxing out my 403bk contributions, and adding to a seperate brokerage account when I could.

<p>

I found a good broker/money manager who has actively managed my account and averaged about 12%/year after expenses. Over the last few years he&#39;s guided me in moving from higher volitility investment to lower volitility, as well as some tax sheltered investments, and I&#39;m in a position now where I can count on keeping up the same income level I had pre-retirement, along with the growth necessary for inflation, as well as keeping a cushion against the inevitible recessions. 

</p><p>

There are three kinds of &#34;money managers&#34; out there. Most are salemen for insurance companies who will stuff you into low-yield annuities and pcoket large commissions. A lot are drones who will sell you what they&#39;re told to sell by their employers. But there is a small subset who make their money and their reputation doing wealth preservation for reirees and people who have inherited wealth. If you can find one who&#39;s interested in taking on someone who doesn&#39;t yet have a fortune, that can be a good way to go.

		If you do want to volunteer your time; organise a conference!  Find something you&#39;re passionate about (free software, gardening...) and see if there&#39;s a related grass-roots conference in your area (for example the &#34;Yet Another Perl Conference&#34;s, the various &#34;Open Source Developers&#39; Conference&#34;s etc).  If so, volunteer to help with the next conference; if not, create one.  It&#39;s a great way to spend time with people, encourage the growth of your field of interest and increase your personal fame within it.  It also comes with a specific due date, so you can walk away at the end if you don&#39;t want to do it again.

		Wonderful article Philip,

<p>

Here are some ideas (many similar to yours) that have worked for me to retire at 51.

</p><p>

[1] Move to a country where you are richer  (I moved from the UK to the USA) Other suggestions would be: Tunisia or Morocco.

</p><p>

[2] Learn something new that&#39;s HARD.  (I took flying lessons at 45 and I am now a private pilot) Other suggestions would be:  play piano, learn chess, get an MA or Phd.

</p><p>

[3] Be creative.  I draw and sculpt. Other suggestions would be: paint, garden, design stuff

</p><p>

[4] Realize that love and sex gets better the older you are.  in your 20s your inexperienced, 
in your 30s your making babies and money, in your forties your getting divorced, but in your 50s your relaxed and enjoying life.

</p><p>

[5] Teach young people your skills and passions.  You will both learn from each other.

</p><p>

[6] Keep buying popular music. Don&#39;t just listen to the hits of your youth but embrace current trends and you will not turn into an old foggie with a bad haircut and dreadful clothes.  My hero whom did this perfectly  was John Peel BBC DJ.

		Thanks for the &#34;food for thought&#34; . I have  lived within my means and worked a goverment job -for 23 years paying union and pension dues. My pension will be  (well under the recommended 70 percent of my $70,000 per year gross income)  at 53 percent , wih no debt.

The human brain needs refreshing , new stimulation to be healthy; dong the same old job  decade -after-decade tends to rot the brain and dry up the soul. My employer seems ill equipted to provide a renewing, refreshing, stimulating workplace.
I am getting out asap at 53 years old, whatever the world brings it will have to be better than the stale, unmotivated, retired-on-your-feet condition of  many long term goverment employees.

It is the Time Management lecture given by Randy Pausch the &#39;Last Lecture&#39; guy who died of pancreatic cancer recently.  The time management lecture was not his last lecture, but a separate one he gave.  It is sad to think how critical time management was for a person who was dying, but I think he was using these time management skills all the time.

		</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		I have to disagree with much of what you say about non-profits, or at least state that it does not apply to the ones I&#39;m familiar with.  For the record, I&#39;ve worked in the corporate world, a government agency, and am currently working in a non-profit.

<p>

&#34;Non-profit organizations exist to provide their staff with great jobs and the fun of making decisions and spending money.&#34;

</p><p>

Wow, that totally does not apply to the non-profits I know.  Maybe if you&#39;re talking about some cushy art museum, but certainly not your run-of-the-mill non-profit or charity that actually *does* something.  My observation is that the non-profits with the biggest budgets seem to be those with the suckiest missions.  The non-profits and charities that actually do something good for people always seem to be the most desperately under-funded.  Probably because rich people like to give money to organizations in comfortable parts of town that they don&#39;t feel awkward visiting.

</p><p>

&#34;They are not especially interested in efficiency or accomplishment. If you&#39;ve come from the commercial world, in which McDonald&#39;s must be ruthlessly efficient for fear of being destroyed by Burger King, working with or in the typical non-profit organization will likely drive you to insanity.&#34;

</p><p>

Again this is totally false.  I work every bit as hard as I did at my corporate jobs, and many of my colleagues work even harder.  With fewer resources and support.  Sure I&#39;ve known some slackers at my non-profit, but those people have all been laid off by now.  We have to be ruthlessly efficient because we have lots of work to do and very few resources to do it with.  Fewer all the time, because donors don&#39;t like to give money for operating expenses (see below) and we always seem to be losing people but the job never gets scaled back.  We&#39;re always scrambling to find ways to squeeze a little more out of the resources we do have.

</p><p>

Regarding accomplishment, non-profits exist to accomplish things, in particular things that are not profitable.  Non-profits *have* to accomplish things so that they can point to them when they ask for more money to continue their mission.  Most people I know who work at non-profits would just go get a cushy corporate job if they didn&#39;t care about the things their organization was trying to accomplish.  Maybe the problem is with the particular non-profits you&#39;ve been exposed to.

</p><p>

&#34;If you believe in their mission, however, it doesn&#39;t make sense to write them a check.&#34;

</p><p>

Oh my gosh this is so false!  Non-profits *desperately* need people to write checks to them, especially for operating expenses!  When people *do* write big checks, these donations often come with restrictions or are attached to some project that will have the donor&#39;s own name emblazoned on it in large letters.  This is often a building project (see your comments about Harvard).  Donors love to have buildings or pieces of buildings with their names on them, or one-off projects that prominently say &#34;Sponsored by DONOR&#34;, but they don&#39;t seem to care about paying the utilities or replacing old equipment or paying the staff.

</p><p>

The problem is that these ego-boosting building projects are unsustainable.  The place I work is saddled with debt because we did a large building project ten years ago.  It has donors&#39; names all over it, but it&#39;s dragging us down.  If those donors had given us unencumbered funds, or put money in our endowment, we&#39;d be in a lot better shape.

</p><p>

I don&#39;t know how to sum this up, other than to say I&#39;ve worked every bit as hard at my nonprofit job as at my corporate ones because I&#39;m passionate about the organization I work for and its mission.  Also because I know my work contributes to something I believe in rather than lining the pockets of some rich guy who will get to retire early while I&#39;ll probably be slaving away until I die.  Sorry about that last comment, but reading about rich people who get to retire early brings out my inner socialist.

		I enjoyed reading your column and I like some of your ideas.  I would think in this difficult economic climate, it is a challenge for retirees to manage their lifestyle into their 80&#39;s.  As a young retiree at 50 years old, my family and friends looked at me with surprise as they expect me to work at least up to 60 years old. Since I have lost my drive to work in the corporate world, I decided to volunteer in non profit organizations, read avidly, blog actively, join a bible study group, travel overseas once or twice a year and spend the rest of my time reviewing my investments.  I have developed my own benchmark for happiness which I reviewed on a yearly basis and improve on areas where I have been lacking.   Although I could say I am doing quite well so far, my greatest challenge is to manage my time, money and talents wisely.  I pray that with God&#39;s grace, I will become more creative in developing new hobbies and even more discerning in my investments and my business ventures.

I am quitting my job as a CEO of a small investment mgt. company at age 43 (am serving 3 months resignation notice fr 6/3/2011) after the job responsibilities became too taxing &amp; stressful for me to endure. Also, the job has taken away my ability to perform my other duties as wife and mother to 4 children well. Nevertheless, the prospect of being left with no &#39;office work&#39; to do from 9-5 after 21 years is still quite unimaginable for me...after reading your article; it helps to put certain perspectives in place. 1st, I have to get my priorities right!. Family first, personal second. I welcome more advice and words of wisdom - maybe from those who retired early &amp; still have school-going children to manage themselves

		This article really goes in depth on many areas effecting early retirees but one area I think could possibly be added is to learn self-sufficent skills.  I personally think anyone retiring without a huge retirement fund should learn how to repair and/or build a home, fix their cars, grow their own food, start a business, etc.

<p>

These skills have come in handy for my early retirement and saved me a nice bit of money.  Since your probably going to have much more time during retirement you can spend some of it upgrading or learning some very practical and money saving skills.

		Hi,

<p>

An interesting post you&#39;ve written.

</p><p>

I think it&#39;s a bit disrespectful to say that non-profit workers are under-skilled and over-eager for pay. I worked in an non-profit and I know that I was working harder than most of the people I know in the private sector and getting paid less. There were constant demands on my time and I had to be able to deal with a wide variety of people and changing circumstances on a regular basis. Working in education or with the under-served is never easy. When I worked in the corporate world, I enjoyed endless air-conditioning (yes, these silly things can be an issue), a computer that ALWAYS worked, free coffee, and other perks. I don&#39;t want to seem inane by stating these small perks, but what I&#39;m getting at is that life in the corporate world is just easier because it&#39;s more comfortable on many levels. Not having to walk 20- 30 minutes to your job site from the parking lot (which you had to pay for) with a load of materials, is very nice. In short, in the non-profit world, I had a world of goals and objectives to reach, but had fewer resources to reach them with. :)

</p><p>

I&#39;m sorry that your relationship with non-profits has been negative. I can&#39;t say that mine was entirely positive. Being underpaid for endless amounts of work is never a fun experience. But put that aside, it was the lack of coherence, follow through, and transparency on the part of some of the management that was difficult to deal with.

</p><p>

Best,
M

		charitable foundations and organizations that are supposed to work for the public benefit, but in fact provide jobs and luxurious vacations (&#34;board meetings&#34;) for members of your family for decades to come; the Enron executives were into these. Supposedly it is illegal and the family foundation ought to recruit employees on the open market, but in practice people are able to say &#34;the only person we could find to review grant applications at our family foundation was our cousin Margaret at $100,000 per year&#34; (reduce estate taxes by 100 percent)

<p>

Shameless?

      <title>EASTL: An Alternative C++ Standard Library From Electronic Arts</title>

<p>EASTL stands for Electronic Arts Standard Template Library. It is a C++ template library of containers, algorithms, and iterators useful for runtime and tool development across multiple platforms. It is a fairly extensive and robust implementation of such a library and has an emphasis on high performance above all other considerations.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with the C++ STL or have worked with other templated container/algorithm libraries, you probably don&#39;t need to read this. If you have no familiarity with C++ templates at all, then you probably will need more than this document to get you up to speed. In this case, you need to understand that templates, when used properly, are powerful vehicles for the ease of creation of optimized C++ code. A description of C++ templates is outside the scope of this documentation, but there is plenty of such documentation on the Internet.</p>
<p>EASTL is suitable for any tools and shipping applications where the functionality of EASTL is useful. Modern compilers are capable of producing good code with templates and many people are using them in both current generation and future generation applications on multiple platforms from embedded systems to servers and mainframes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___constructionphysics_substack_com_p_where-are-the-robotic-bricklayers/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When researching construction, you invariably discover that any new or innovative idea has actually been tried over and over again, often stretching back decades. One of these new-but-actually-old ideas is the idea of a mechanical bricklayer, a machine to automate the construction of masonry walls.</p><p>It’s easy to see the appeal of this idea - masonry construction seems almost perfectly suited for mechanization [0]. It’s extremely repetitive - constructing a masonry building requires setting tens or hundreds of thousands of bricks or blocks, each one (nearly) identical, each one set in the same way. It doesn’t seem like it would require physically complex movements - each brick gets a layer of mortar applied, and is simply laid in place next to the previous one. And because each brick and mortar joint is the same size, placement is almost deterministic - each brick is the same fixed distance from the previous one.</p><p>On top of this, masonry, especially block masonry, is one of the most physically punishing construction tasks, since it requires hours and hours of repetitively moving extremely heavy objects. All together masonry seems like the perfect candidate for a task to hand over to a machine, and it’s something people have been attempting for over 100 years.</p><h3>Early Attempts</h3><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24266b51-506d-47bd-8141-d30144d4984d_609x393.png"></a><figcaption>John Thompson’s 1904 bricklaying machine</figcaption></figure></div><p>The first attempts at machine-laid masonry date back to the turn of the century - we can find patents issued for mechanical bricklayers in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=brick+laying+machine&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj94fKjq_3xAhVIrJ4KHVkRB944ChDoATAAegQIBhAC#v=onepage&amp;q=brick%20laying%20machine&amp;f=false">1899</a>, <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ac/13/fa/b5f479fda30195/US772191.pdf">1904</a>, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NT_nAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=brick+laying+machine&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj474rBqv3xAhVOj54KHYetAQ0Q6AEwBnoECAsQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=brick%20laying%20machine&amp;f=false">1924</a>, all by different individuals (some of whom worked on their idea for years - John Thompson, who was was awarded the 1904 patent, had additional patents in 1918 and 1926). These machines would (theoretically) run along the top of a wall, set down a layer of mortar, and place bricks one at a time. These machines couldn’t sense anything about their environment, or measure where a brick needed to go - they simply extruded a layer of mortar and mechanically placed a brick at regular intervals. It’s unclear how many of these machines ever made it beyond the drawing board, but at least one of these (John Knight’s) was used to build a brick wall that <a href="https://www.britainbycar.co.uk/farnham/489-john-henry-knight">allegedly still stands today</a>.</p><p>This same concept would reappear several times over the next few decades - patents can be found for similar machines issued in the 60s and 70s. This video from 1967 of the “Motor Mason &#39;&#39; shows one in action - it’s not all that different from the early 1900s efforts:</p><p id="youtube2-4MWald1Goqk" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;4MWald1Goqk&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4MWald1Goqk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>These attempts at mechanical bricklayers never made it far beyond the demonstration stage, and never found any sort of commercial success.</p><h3>The 1980s: Bricklaying Robots</h3><p>Beginning in the late 1980s and early 90s, we start to see attempts at mechanizing masonry based around robotic arms. Unlike the previous machines, which were purely mechanical, these machines had an information processing component. Instead of mindlessly repeating the same motions, these arms would combine a high degree-of freedom robotic arm with sensors and control systems to “see” the brick, see where it needed to go, and deliberately grab it and place it there.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F079e277f-0ee9-41ee-9768-12ccfafd6fce_755x474.png"></a><figcaption>Schematic of the ROCCO system, via <a href="https://www.iaarc.org/publications/proceedings_of_the_11th_isarc/first_results_of_the_development_of_the_masonry_robot_system_rocco_a_fault_tolerant_assembly_tool.html">IAARC</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>For a while this was an entire sub-field of academic research - we can find examples in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0921889088900206">Slocum 1988</a>, <a href="https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/outlines-of-two-masonry-robot-systems">Lehiten 1989</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0926580595000097">Rihani 1996</a>, <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1993)6:1(19)">Altobelli 1993</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0926580595000151">Pritschow 1996</a>, the <a href="http://www.iaarc.org/publications/proceedings_of_the_5th_isarc/a_robotized_wall_erection_system_with_solid_components.html">SMAS in Japan</a>, and the <a href="https://www.iaarc.org/publications/proceedings_of_the_11th_isarc/first_results_of_the_development_of_the_masonry_robot_system_rocco_a_fault_tolerant_assembly_tool.html">ROCCO system</a>. But despite all the effort expended, these attempts saw about the same level of success as the previous, purely mechanical masonry machines. Most didn’t get past the level of technical descriptions (“here’s how you COULD build a masonry robot”), a few reached the level of prototypes, but essentially no progress was made beyond that. At least one researcher gave up, declaring that general purpose construction robots would be infeasible for the foreseeable future. The single example I can find of a system that <em>might</em> have been used in production is Multistone 8000, a German system that could, with human assistance, automatically assemble masonry wall panels in a factory-like environment.</p><h3>Current Attempts</h3><p>Over the years, masonry has declined in importance as a construction technology in the developed world, and with it the interest in automating it. Unlike with concrete 3D printing, where there are dozens of attempts to develop the technology, I can only find a handful of current efforts to automate masonry.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3975fb2b-12f1-407a-b215-a96cfa777141_719x436.png"></a><figcaption>Hadrian X, via <a href="https://www.fbr.com.au/">FBR</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The most advanced of these seems to be the <a href="https://www.fbr.com.au/">Hadrian system</a> by Fastbrick Robotics. Hadrian uses a hollow boom mounted to a truck, through which masonry blocks are transported (sort of like a concrete pump truck). When the block reaches the end of the boom, it’s sprayed with an industrial adhesive (instead of conventional mortar) and grabbed by a robot arm, which places it into the correct position.</p><p>The reach of this boom, combined with it’s vehicle mounting, means that Hadrian has a lot fewer restrictions as to where it can place blocks than other mechanized masonry systems. It’s capable of placing blocks in tight hallways or complex corners, and Hadrian can construct all the walls of a small building with just a few moves of the vehicle. Hadrian can currently set around 200 blocks an hour, but they’re aiming to be able to do 1000 blocks an hour or more (the blocks it sets are different from the block masonry used in the US, but in US masons can set somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 blocks a day).</p><p>Hadrian has been in development since 2006, and has only recently started to be used on commercial jobsites - they’ve built the block walls for 3 or 4 buildings in Australia so far. It seems like they’ve had some struggles as a company (not surprising for a hardware system that’s been in development for over 15 years), and they had what appears to be a fairly serious round of layoffs in 2020. But over the last few months there’s been a slow trickle of projects built using the system.</p><p>But the most commercially successful mechanized masonry system I’m aware of is the <a href="https://www.construction-robotics.com/sam-2/">SAM</a>, semi autonomous mason. SAM is a masonry robot built by Construction Robotics, and has been in use on commercial projects since 2015. Unlike Hadrian, which lays block, SAM lays normal clay bricks - it consists of a robot arm, mortar dispenser and conveyor belt, mounted to a wheeled chassis. The robot arm grabs a brick, applies a layer of mortar to it, and places it into position on the wall, based on an internal “brick map” indicating the location of every brick to be set. Once the brick is in place, it repeats the process, traversing back and forth as it builds up the wall (human masons are required to set bricks at the ends of the wall). SAM has a series of sensors to compensate for the movement of the platform and ensure it’s placing bricks level, and can work with bricks of all different sizes (though it won’t build CMU block walls). It gets mounted to a movable scaffolding that’s raised gradually as the wall is completed.</p><p>Like Hadrian, it also seems like SAM has had some struggles. It can perform well on very long stretches of wall, but on short walls it has trouble outperforming human masons. It can’t turn corners, and it can’t finish the masonry joints. At its best it seems to lay brick around 5 times faster than a human can, but it requires masons to follow behind it to clean the joints and occasionally level the bricks, and an on-site technician to handle technical issues. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07THDGSPG?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_asin_title">book written about the development of SAM</a> documents one challenge after another, and ends with them struggling to find buyers for it. The promotional material on Construction Robotics’ website suggests that it’s no longer their main focus - more emphasis is given to their other product, MULE.</p><p>Other than SAM and Hadrian, there are a few other mechanical bricklayers in various stages of development. Craftsmac, a company out of India, just recently announced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WFZmu4rs8E">robotic mason</a> used for building CMU walls - it appears somewhat similar to SAM, a wheeled chassis with a robot arm, conveyor, and mortar mixer mounted to it. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIwmtyvoFmw&amp;t=58s">UK system</a> for robotically laying bricks uses a track mounted system gantry system, which both lets it turn corners and eliminates the problem of how to move the robot from floor to floor (trading it for the time and expense of having to assemble the system upfront). <a href="https://rob-technologies.com/robotic-brickwork#brickwork-use-cases-section">ROB</a> uses an off-the-shelf robot arm to build highly variable masonry panels (though it doesn’t seem to be able to handle mortar). You also see the occasional academic effort. Overall the list of efforts in this space is pretty short.</p><p>One area where we do see some commercial success with mechanical bricklaying is with brick roads - a variety of companies offer machines that can “print” a section of road made of bricks. As we’ve <a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/why-did-agriculture-mechanize-and">seen previously</a>, road construction is slightly easier to mechanize than building construction.</p><h3>Masonry Assistants</h3><p>A slightly different category of machines aimed at improving masonry productivity is what I’ll call “masonry assistants”. These are machines designed to assist with physically lifting the block (they seem to be more common with block than brick) and taking the strain off the mason, while still allowing the mason to manipulate it into position</p><p>Masonry assistants date from at least 1994, when the military experimented with <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA302081">MAMA</a>, the Mechatronically Assisted Mason’s Aid. It consisted of a gripper attached to a track mounted boom arm. The mason could use the gripper to move the block into place without having to physically lift it. Since then several companies have developed variations of the boom mounted gripper idea - the Layher Balance, Rimatem, and Assistance System Steinherr were a few I can find records of. The only system like this I’m aware of currently for sale is the MULE, sold by Construction Robotics (they seem to have had much more success with it than with SAM).</p><p>But the most interesting of these masonry assistant systems might be the <a href="https://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2020/06/01/exoskeletons-for-bricklayers-science-fiction-is-now-reality/">exoskeleton in development by FRACO,</a> just released last year. It was adapted from a model developed for the military, and has various passive and active lifting mechanisms designed to reduce the strain on the mason’s muscles when manipulating blocks.</p><p>Of course, a machine to aid the moving of heavy objects isn’t exactly revolutionary - a commenter on the agricultural productivity article pointed out that one of the most important advancements in masonry productivity was the telescopic handler, which eliminated having to manually move pallets of block into place on the jobsite.</p><h3>Why aren’t mechanical masons already here?</h3><p>Masonry seemed like the perfect candidate for mechanization, but a hundred years of limited success suggests there’s some aspect to it that prevents a machine from easily doing it. This makes it an interesting case study, as it helps define <em>exactly</em> where mechanization becomes difficult - what makes laying a brick so different than, say, hammering a nail, such that the latter is almost completely mechanized and the former is almost completely manual?</p><p>There seems to be a few factors at work. One is the fact that a brick or block isn’t simply set down on a solid surface, but is set on top of a thin layer of mortar, which is a mixture of water, sand, and cementitious material. Mortar has sort of complex physical properties - it’s a non-newtonian fluid, and it’s viscosity increases when it’s moved or shaken. This makes it difficult to apply in a purely mechanical, deterministic way (and also probably makes it difficult for masons to explain what they’re doing - watching them place it you can see lots of complex little motions, and the mortar behaving in sort of strange not-quite-liquid but not-quite-solid ways). And since mortar is a jobsite-mixed material, there will be variation in it’s properties from batch to batch.</p><p>Masonry machines have constantly struggled with the mortar aspect of masonry; many of them simply ignored the aspect of the problem. The academic studies of the late 80s and early 90s were often based on using mortarless walls, wall systems that don’t require mortar joints (such as surface bonded masonry), or mortar alternatives that behaved a little more predictably (which is what Hadrian ended up using). In his 1996 paper, Pritschow comes right out and says that trying to solve the problem of handling mortar is too difficult. The folks that have figured out how to reliably apply mortar still can’t quite manage to produce a clean mortar joint - they simply slather the mortar on there, requiring workers to follow behind and clean it up. In some ways efforts like SAM don’t look all that different from the 50-year-old Motor Mason in this regard.</p><p>Mortar joints make setting blocks more complicated. Whereas a nailgun can apply force to a nail and get a fairly uniform result every time (and if it can’t, it’s not critical - a nail will still function if its driven slightly askew), setting a block on a layer of field-mixed non-newtonian fluid isn’t so forgiving. Without some feedback from the environment (measuring the levelness of the block that’s been set), it’s hard to be sure that the wall is being built level. Human masons are constantly checking the levelness of their blocks with strings or field levels to ensure the wall remains true as it gets built, and making slight adjustments as needed; a mechanical mason needs some way to do the same. SAM seems to have MOSTLY solved this problem, but every so often still needs the workers following behind to tap the blocks level.</p><p>This is one of the main things that separates driving a nail from setting a block - the necessity of making adjustments based on feedback from the environment. Things like nailguns, circular saws, and other power tools are in some sense more like the masonry assistants - they perform some purely physical task, while leaving all the information processing and precise placement work in the hands of humans. A nailgun isn’t responsible for figuring out where a nail needs to go, and moving itself into position - it simply does the physical task of striking the nail.</p><p>The history of routers and milling machines offers an instructive parallel. The first ones were developed in the late 1800s/early 1900s, and the capability for programmatically controlling them was developed in the late 40s/early 50s. But it’s only recently where we’ve had the capability of incorporating real-time feedback, enabling products like the <a href="https://www.shapertools.com/en-us/">Shaper Origin</a> (a handheld router that autocorrects human movements ). Robustly getting a machine to react based on its surrounding environment remains a complex problem, even if the machine is <em>physically</em> capable of doing it.</p><p>There’s also a few other ancillary problems making masonry machines tricky: </p><ul><li><p>Bricks and blocks are large and heavy, which means larger, more expensive machinery is needed to manipulate them (especially if you want to manipulate them <em>quickly</em>, as force scales with acceleration). </p></li><li><p>In the US, masonry walls are constructed with a large amount of reinforcement, which would be difficult to handle for a simple block-based machine (on Hadrian’s projects, the reinforcement was installed manually)</p></li><li><p>For <a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction">risk-aversion</a> reasons, it’s hard to get contractors on board with your technology [1]. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2msCMjuqeiY">surprisingly candid video</a> from Construction Robotics goes into detail about how difficult it was to convince a particular client to use their system, and the book about the company details many more difficult sells.</p></li></ul><h3>Should we expect to see mechanized masonry get more popular?</h3><p>This is a tough question to answer. Fundamentally, it seems like it depends on what progress in robotics, software, computer vision, and other technologies (which I’ll lump together as “automation”) looks like.</p><p>For all it’s difficulties, masonry has been more successfully automated than other building systems - it’s one of the few systems where commercial robots for building it are actually on the market for general use. So progress in automation technology might plausibly benefit masonry construction most of all, as it’s arguably the farthest along. If automated masonry systems got smaller, faster, could more easily handle corners and finish joints, it might start to look like a very attractive system.</p><p>However, it could just as easily be a rising tide lifts all boats scenario - advancing automation technology could easily be applied to other building systems (wood, steel, etc.) as well. It becomes a question of a question of what the relative improvement curves look like - what gets better the fastest, how long does that stay true?</p><p>Blocks are quite heavy, which means the machines to manipulate them will likely always be more expensive than the machines for manipulating a lighter building system. And even large blocks individually make up a small fraction of the overall building. So automated masonry systems might end up being more expensive and have lower production rates than other building types. We could see a situation where there’s a small window of time where automated masonry becomes extremely popular/competitive, but then is quickly overshadowed as the technology gets adapted for other building systems.</p><p>[0] - There are, roughly, two different kinds of masonry. Brick masonry, which is made from clay bricks, and concrete masonry (CMU, or concrete masonry units), which is made from hollow concrete blocks. To a first approximation, in the US brick masonry is purely decorative and doesn’t support the weight of the building. Block masonry is used as the load bearing structure.</p><p>[1] - The SAM book details quite a few instances of cascading failures caused by process changes. On one job, SAM is unable to set bricks because the wall is unbraced, and the bricklaying platform is much heavier than the ones the firm was used to using, and the wall has insufficient bracing force. The entire project is slowed down. On another project, SAM is slowed down by the masons unexpectedly changing the size of the bricks, which forces them to recreate the brick-map used to program the machine.</p><p><em>Feel free to contact me!</em></p><p><em>email: <a href="mailto:briancpotter@gmail.com">briancpotter@gmail.com</a></em></p><p><em>LinkedIn: <a href="https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxd0kuPsjwYBuBfM-wwbaUcFizEz8OIioyC4oaUUrDKyVIU_fUvzuy-pGmbPE97p-lFiWR5LV52U7dS-UyxfDXMrtizLZiUTChdy0TMU3uMoQmBqaQ2MBA1EoW3cSYYKwkvbKXpkoJTInldfZoh0AA2lYvNkGWlOLEAIJmBNENDSWpkWqYhwlJM9L9M0qWcVZTZ7MHEq66YUtgXKZv2azz5QvNh_MaMyhyO2i5pJaG3Ea3LoUA_xdWzuM0W3mU68X-C-GBsmyDff3fHTV-Kcubvmw7855-f1zXNEmf32kd3nj1gdSCzoim2j81Pil7h1bue9vm3bgVTfkRncL-msAF3ZxLQvtGTR7dSD2-Ps8s1dsVZ3lQh9URbuLi8OJHeh5jQw2m3MRs0PIfNqvSws8ojX0RFM9u-GRYp8-_H7Q7-eOUml11zckOp8pW5jPVx5X3j0mLz7bvOFv3NlGroFHupz3BPHuE53ufeOvIJeIt38XTm8_lkN1WffpJuppdggnPvuQxo6MvZiaqF4_ZiFwptvb3eMirmaJcWT7xWPXlN6lPUhpbxCDRgwkf3dmDs3SL3HFau3qxg1J0KFUXPtRPcw7aXW7DnfeF7E989BcsMcxc64N66csyN4wksk8XSTc97lSP1sRl357iPkAd8hdsIIDhIgRCBYTeCIwIwgQkxDR2CMYMZNsc4Y9BKgKXpOra-NPD__1WEnQhOKtrUH4tDR_7r4FMaxMXDWnYVl6-YVSQpWGpL0TFF_nH-NRPnrGJiYJ7GRNpQR7qpmyY2Bol_9j60LQABGmNlyE7r4VRl07pqh7voB3RzebWctv8AnbARWw">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-potter-6a082150/</a></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Web scraping is usually easy to get started, especially on a small scale. However, as you try to scale it up, it gets exponentially difficult. Scraping 10,000 records can easily be done with simple web scraper scripts in any programming language, but as you try to scrape millions of pages, you would need to architect and build features on your web scraping script that allows you to scale, maintain and unblock your scrapers.</p>
<p><strong>DataHen Till</strong> solves the following problems:</p>

<p>Scraping to millions or even billions of records requires much more pre-planning. It&#39;s not simply running your existing web scraper script in a bigger CPU/Ram machine.
More thoughts are needed, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to log massive amounts of HTTP requests.</li>
<li>How to troubleshoot HTTP requests, when it fails at scale.</li>
<li>How to minimize bandwidth usage.</li>
<li>How to rotate proxy IPs.</li>
<li>How to handle anti-scrapers.</li>
<li>What happens when a scraper fails.</li>
<li>How to resume scrapers after they are fixed.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Till provides a plug-and-play method of making your web scrapers scalable, and maintainable following best practices at <a href="https://www.datahen.com" rel="nofollow">DataHen</a> that makes web scraping a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>As you try to scale up the number of requests, quite often, the target websites will detect your scraper and try to block your requests using Captcha, or throttling, or denying your request completely.</p>
<p>Till helps you circumvent detected as a web scraper by identifying your scraper as a real web browser. It does this by generating random <code>user-agent</code> headers and randomizing proxy IPs (that you supply) on every HTTP request.</p>
<p>Till also makes it easy for you to troubleshoot on why the target website block your scraper.</p>

<p>Maintaining high-scale scrapers is challenging due to the massive volume of requests and interactions between your scrapers and the target websites. In order for a smooth operation, you need to think through how to maintain your scrapers regularly.</p>
<p>You need to know how to raise and triage errors as they occur on your scrapers, not all errors on web scraping should be treated equally. some are ignorable, and some are urgent. So, you will need to know what will be the details of your &#34;development-deployment-maintenance&#34; process will be.</p>
<p>Till solves this by logging all your HTTP requests and categorizing them whether it was successful (2XX statuses) or failures(non 2XX statuses). Till also provides a Web UI to analyze the request history and make sense of what happened during your scraping process.</p>
<p>Till makes it even easier for scraper maintenance by assigning each request with a unique Global ID (GID) that is derived from the request&#39;s URL, method, body, etc. You can then use this GID to troubleshoot your scrapers on where it went wrong.</p>

<p>The biggest difficulty facing any web scraper developer is when there are scraping failures. Your scraper fails when fetching or parsing certain URLs, but when you look at the target website and URLs, everything looks fine. How do you troubleshoot what already happened in the scenario?. How do you reproduce that failed scrape so that you can fix the issue?</p>
<p>Till stores all HTTP requests and the responses (including the response body/content) into a local cache. If at anytime your scraper encounters an error, you can then use the request&#39;s GID (Till assigns a Global ID, also called GID, on every request) to find the request and the actual response and content from the cache. In this way, you can analyze what went wrong with that particular request.</p>

<p>Websites change all the time and without notice. Imagine running your web scraper for a week and then suddenly, somewhere along the way, it fails. It is frustrating that once you&#39;ve fixed the scraper, there is a high chance that you&#39;d need to start over from scratch again. And, on top of this, there are additional consequences, such as time delay, and further charges related to proxy usage, bandwidth, storage, VM costs, etc.</p>
<p>Till solves this by allowing you to replay your scrapers without actually needing to resend the HTTP requests to the target server.
Till does this by assigning each HTTP request its own unique Global ID (GID) that is generated from the request&#39;s URL, method, headers, etc. It then stores all HTTP responses in the Cache based on their GID.</p>
<p>When you restart your scraper, the scraping process can go blazingly fast because Till now serves the cached version of the HTTP responses. All of this without any code changes on your existing web scraper.</p>

<p>Till works as a Man In The Middle (MITM) proxy that listens to incoming HTTP(S) requests and forwards those requests to the target server as needed. While it does so, it enhances each request to avoid being detected by anti-scrapers. It also logs and caches the responses to make your scraper maintainable and scalable.</p>
<p>Connect your scraper to Till via the <code>proxy</code> protocol that is typically common in any programming language.</p>
<p>Your scraper will then continue to run as-is and it will get instantly become more unblockable, scalable, and maintainable.</p>

<p>You can connect your scraper to Till without many code changes.</p>
<p>If you want to connect to Till using curl, this is how:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ curl -k --proxy http://localhost:2933 https://fetchtest.datahen.com/echo/request

<p>Till decrypts and encrypts HTTPS traffic on the fly between your scraper and the target websites.  In order to do so, your scraper (or browser) must be able to trust the built-in Certificate Authority (CA). This means the CA certificate that Till generates for you, needs to be installed on the computer where the scraper is running.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not wish to install the CA certificate, you can still have your scraper connect to the Till server by disabling/ignoring security checks in your scraper. Please refer to the programming language/framework/tool that your scraper uses.</p>

      <title>Spreadsheet Formulas for Personal Finance</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
  
  <p><span>Aug 2021</span></p>
  <p>I love spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs like Microsoft’s Excel, Apple’s Numbers and Google Sheets are the secret heroes of our civilization.</p>

<p>I’ve also been interested in personal finance and the <em>FIRE</em> community for a while—not so much in the early retirement aspect but in the financial literacy it teaches its members. I have combined my passion for both into one mega-spreadsheet that I use to track my income, expenses, savings and investments in one overview. While creating this spreadsheet I got proficient in some new formulas, which I’ll share here—and also write down for my own reference.</p>

<h2 id="annuity-functions">Annuity Functions</h2>

<p>An <em>annuity</em> is a regular set of payments that accumulates into/diminishes a <em>principal</em> (basically a balance) that often has an associated <em>interest</em> on the principal. This is traditionally used for answering questions around <em>life annuities</em> which are products bought to guarantee an income for a certain amount of time—e.g. you want to buy an annuity that pays €250 per month for the next 10 years while the interest rate is 2%, what should its price be? These functions are also useful for calculating things before your retirement, however.</p>

<p>The functions for calculating with annuities are <code>PMT</code>, <code>RATE</code>, <code>PV</code>, <code>NPER</code> and <code>FV</code>. I will give an example for each of these and you will notice that each takes the other four as input values.</p>

<h3 id="fv">FV</h3>

<p><code>FV</code> stands for Future Value and it allows you to answer the following question: given an initial sum, an interest rate, a periodic payment and a duration, what will the balance be after the last payment? The definition is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>FV(rate, nper, pmt, pv, type)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only argument I’ll gloss over in this post is <code>type</code>, which specified whether the payment is done at the beginning (1) or end (0) of the period, which matters for the interest.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>FV</code> function to answer the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I have €1000 in an investment that grows with 5% annually and I contribute €100 per month for the next 10 years, how much will accrue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be calculated with the following formula:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>FV(5% ÷ 12, 10 × 12, 100, 1000) = -17,175.24
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Huh? Why is it negative? It’s because the formulas work with ‘inflows’ and ‘outflows’. Every month 100 flows into the ‘sum’ and at the end the whole sum flows ‘out’—therefore it’s negative. You can also flip the signs on the <code>pmt</code> and <code>pv</code> values which will make the <code>FV</code> result positive.</p>

<h3 id="pmt">PMT</h3>

<p><code>PMT</code> means Payment and is useful for mortgage calculations and savings goals. It is defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PMT(rate, nper, pv, fv, type)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am looking to get a €200,000 mortgage to buy a house and the current interest rate is 2%. I will have to make monthly payments for the next 30 years. What will my monthly payment be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to this question is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PMT(2% ÷ 12, 30 × 12, -200000, 0) = 739.24
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another question that can be solved with the same function is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have €3000 saved in an account that grows with 4% per year. I want to have €200,000 saved 10 years from now to buy a house, how much will I have to contribute per month to reach my goal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer (note that <code>pv</code> and <code>fv</code> have opposite signs, because they flow in opposite directions):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PMT(4% ÷ 12, 10 × 12, 3000, -200000) = 1,327.86
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rate">RATE</h3>

<p><code>RATE</code> calculates what interest rate you need to match the other parameters. I personally haven’t found a need for this, but you could use it to figure out what investment target you need to hit to reach your goal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RATE(nper, pmt, pv, fv, type)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As example, if you have €1000 and want to grow it to €100.000 in 20 years without making any contributions, what growth rate do you need?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RATE(20, 0, 1000, -100000) = 25.89%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not very realistic!</p>

<h3 id="nper">NPER</h3>

<p><code>NPER</code> calculates the Number of Periods it takes to reach a Future Value. One of the fundamental blog posts in the FIRE community is <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/" target="_blank">The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement</a>—the gist of which is that the specific amounts of how much you make or save don’t matter for calculating how long until you’re financially independent, but rather the ratio between them: your savings rate. We can use <code>NPER</code> to make this calculation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>NPER(rate, pmt, pv, fv, type)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To recreate the table from the blogpost we use the following formula:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Investment Returns = 5%
Savings Rate = 50%
Safe Withdrawal Rate = 4%

NPER(IR, -SR, 0, (1 - SR) ÷ SWR) = 16.62 years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we put this into a table we get the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Savings Rate</th>
      <th>Years Until FI</th>
    </tr>

<h3 id="pv">PV</h3>

<p><code>PV</code> for Present Value makes it possible to calculate how much you need to contribute today to get a certain result in the future, or the value of something today discounted from the future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv, type)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s answer the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to buy an annuity that yields €100/month for the next 10 years and the interest rate is 2%. How much will it cost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PV(2% ÷ 12, 10 × 12, −100, 0) = 10,867.98
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An controversial book on investing I recently read is <a href="https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net" target="_blank">Lifecycle Investing</a> which argues that young people are often much too conservative in their investment strategy, because they should model their future earnings as a bond and allocate enough to equities to compensate for holding this bond, even leveraging up to 100% to get the right allocation. To calculate the present value we can use the following formula, assuming you will work for another 20 years, can save €300 per month and discount your future earnings by 4% annually:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PV(4% ÷ 12, 20 × 12, -300, 0) = -49,506.56
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we can value our future savings at about €50k in current monies and adjust our portfolio accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you have any useful spreadsheet tricks you learned recently? Please let me know, I’m always looking to expand my toolbox!</p>

By studying the relationships between their solutions — rather than the solutions on their own — he created new concepts that have since become an essential part of many branches of mathematics.</p>
<p>No one knows why Galois found himself on a Paris dueling ground early in the morning of May 30, 1832, but the night before, legend has it that he stayed up late finishing his last manuscripts. There he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><small>Go to the roots of these calculations! Group the operations. Classify them </small><small>according to their complexities rather than their appearances! This, I believe, is the mission of future mathematicians. This is the road on which I am embarking in this work.</small></p></blockquote>
<p>Galois’ edict emerged from a mathematical predicament. In the 1500s, mathematicians had studied polynomials like <em>x</em><sup>2 </sup>− 2 and <em>x</em><sup>4 </sup>− 10<em>x</em><sup>2 </sup>+ 22. They had tried to find simple formulas that would allow them to calculate the roots of those polynomials — the values of <em>x</em> that make the equation equal zero — but could only find them when the highest exponent was no greater than 4.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Galois himself proved that no such formulas exist. So he devised a new way of studying roots: Instead of calculating them exactly, he realized he could study the algebraic relationships between them — focusing on their complexities, rather than their appearances.</p>
<p>In spirit, his perspective was similar to considering a shape’s different symmetries. These are the various ways of reorienting the shape so that it still looks the same, such as rotating a square by 180 degrees. Symmetries between a polynomial’s roots are ways of swapping them so that they maintain the same algebraic relationship.</p>
<p>And just as some shapes have more symmetries than others (a circle has infinitely many; a square has just eight), you can rearrange the roots of some polynomial equations more freely than you can rearrange the roots of others.</p>
<p>“Some ways of rearranging the roots can be incompatible with the rules of algebra. In this sense, the roots might not be entirely interchangeable with one another,” said <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/">Brian Conrad</a> of Stanford University.</p>
<p>The extent to which roots can be swapped with each other while maintaining algebraic consistency is a subtle property that tells mathematicians a lot about how to recognize features of polynomials that can’t be seen just by looking at them. It’s easiest to see with examples. Let’s take a look at two, each of which has three roots (since the highest exponent of each is 3):</p>
<p><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 7<em>x</em> + 5</p>
<p><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 7<em>x</em> + 7</p>
<p>On paper, they’re nearly identical. But behind the scenes, the roots of one can be rearranged in more ways than the roots of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) first. Here, we have three roots: <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. We can combine them algebraically to make a new value by taking the product of pairs of roots and adding them together. For all cubic polynomials — those with 3 as their highest exponent — with a coefficient of 1 for the cubed term, it’s known that this particular algebraic expression made from the roots always equals the coefficient of the linear term, or the term that is raised to the first power. In our example, this is −7.</p>
<p>We get this algebraic equation:</p>
<p><em>ab</em> + <em>ac</em> + <em>bc</em> = −7.</p>
<p>Now let’s rearrange the roots, leaving <em>c</em> alone, but switching <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. We get:</p>
<p><em>ba</em> + <em>bc</em> + <em>ac</em> = −7.</p>
<p>Rearranging the roots in this way preserves the algebraic relationship between them: The equation is still true because multiplication and addition are commutative, meaning that swapping the order of things — like shuffling the roots around — doesn’t change the answer. In fact, for this example, all six possible ways of rearranging the roots (including the one where they don’t change) preserves the relationship:</p>
<p><strong><em>a, b, c: ab</em></strong><strong> + <em>ac</em> + <em>bc</em> = </strong><strong>−</strong><strong>7</strong></p>
<p>Now let’s look at the second polynomial,<em> g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 7<em>x</em> + 7. If we call the roots <em>r</em>, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>, then an analogous equation to the one for <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) holds as well:</p>
<p><em>rs</em> + <em>rt</em> + <em>st</em> = −7.</p>
<p>This will be true for any cubic polynomial whose initial term is <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> and whose linear term is −7<em>x</em>. And again, all six of the possible arrangements still equal −7. But curiously, for <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>), not all of them are considered symmetries of the polynomial.</p>
<p>This is because the algebraic relationships among its roots are more complex: There is an additional special algebraic relationship that its roots satisfy. The special relationship is (<em>r</em> − <em>t</em>)(<em>r</em> − <em>s</em>)(<em>t</em> − <em>s</em>) = 7 (when you assume <em>r </em>is less than <em>s</em>, and <em>s</em> is less than <em>t</em>). Only three of the six possible rearrangements of its roots preserve both algebraic relationships: <em>rs</em> + <em>rt</em> + <em>st</em> = 7 and (<em>r</em> − <em>t</em>)(<em>r</em> − <em>s</em>)(<em>t</em> − <em>s</em>) = 7:</p>
<p><strong><em>r</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>t: </em>(<em>r </em></strong><strong>− <em>t</em>)(<em>r</em> </strong><strong>− <em>s</em>)(<em>t</em> </strong><strong>− <em>s</em>) = 7<br/>
</strong><em>  s</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>t: </em>(<em>s </em>− <em>t</em>)(<em>s </em>− <em>r</em>)(<em>t </em>− <em>r</em>) = −7</p>
<p>The three rearrangements in bold preserve all algebraic relationships among the roots, even beyond these two. Consequently, these three rearrangements are considered to be the symmetries of the polynomial.</p>
<p>It’s not obvious at a glance that the two polynomials have different levels of complexity, but it becomes visible when you adopt the perspective Galois invented.</p>

<p>Galois packaged his way of thinking in new objects — which came to be called Galois groups — that encode the complexity of the algebraic relationships between the roots of a given polynomial. Within these relationships, rearrangements of roots can be applied one after another, but they can be undone to get back to where you started — just as you can apply the symmetries of a square and then undo them to get back to the exact position you began with.</p>
<p>This idea reflects the general concept of a group in mathematics, which is a collection of symmetries, whether they apply to a square or the roots of a polynomial. Galois groups were the first instances of the concept of a group, and Galois’ ideas blossomed into what today is a powerful, ubiquitous area of research called group theory.</p>
<p>Galois groups provide a powerful perspective from which to study polynomial equations. If you know the Galois group of a polynomial, then the behavior of its roots can be understood by accessing many of the tools of group theory. The insights you’ll gain through this approach are far more illuminating than the ones you can get by performing algebra on the polynomial itself.</p>
<p>“[With Galois groups] you get this one piece of information, and it spreads and tells you so much more,” said <a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~harbater/">David Harbater</a> of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For instance, the Galois group immediately tells you whether a polynomial can be solved at all, and it allows you to compare the underlying structure of different polynomials. Galois groups can also be used to study various mathematical objects in algebra and number theory in ways that open up solutions to problems that aren’t otherwise available.</p>
<p>“Turning a question about polynomials into a question about groups opens up the door to many other mathematical operations and techniques that cannot be readily described in the original language of polynomials,” said Conrad.</p>
<p>This expansiveness has allowed Galois groups to play a central role in many of the most celebrated mathematical projects over the last century or so. They featured in Gerd Faltings’ 1983 proof of the Mordell conjecture and Andrew Wiles’ 1994 proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.</p>

<p>Galois groups are also at the heart of some of the most exciting ongoing work in mathematics today. As <em>Quanta</em> explained in a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-a-new-shape-mathematicians-link-geometry-and-numbers-20210719/">recent feature story</a>, they are the linchpin of the sprawling Langlands program, which turns a question about polynomials into a more sophisticated and revealing question about the relationship between Galois groups and another special class of groups.</p>
<p>Though Évariste Galois’ life was cut short, his greatest achievement will continue to advance mathematics for centuries to come — though it’s hard to predict exactly how.</p>
<p>“[Galois groups] just have a way of appearing in surprising places,” said <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~jose/">Jose Rodriguez</a> of the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2650269799" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth" data-authors="Robert N. Charette" data-headline="The STEM Crisis Is a Myth"><div><p>
<strong>You must have seen the warning </strong>a thousand times: Too few young people study scientific or technical subjects, businesses can&#39;t find enough workers in those fields, and the country&#39;s competitive edge is threatened.
</p><p>
	It pretty much doesn&#39;t matter what country you&#39;re talking about—the United States is facing this crisis, as is 
	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/worldbusiness/17engineers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Japan</a>, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/stem-report-published/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/education-to-tackle-shortage-of-20000-engineers-in-australia/story-e6frea83-1225907964866">Australia</a>, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/china/addressing_chinas_looming_talent_shortage">China</a>,<a href="http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/93684:running-out-of-engineers"> Brazil</a>, <a href="http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-south-africa/sas-engineering-shortage-widens">South Africa</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aozIkbu2rB0">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/india-facing-shortage-of-engineers-in-st-drdo-dg/article4356570.ece">India</a>…the list goes on. In many of these countries, the predicted shortfall of STEM (short for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workers is supposed to number in the hundreds of thousands or even the millions. A 2012 report by President Obama&#39;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, for instance, stated that over the next decade, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_2-25-12.pdf">1 million additional STEM graduates</a> will be needed. In the U.K., the Royal Academy of Engineering reported last year that the nation will have to graduate <a href="http://www.theengineer.co.uk/channels/policy-and-business/report-reveals-scale-of-uks-engineering-skills-shortage/1014081.article">100 000 STEM majors every year until 2020</a> just to stay even with demand. <a href="http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?addmenu=false&amp;document=PROD0000000000288952&amp;rdShowArchivedDocus=true&amp;rwobj=ReDisplay.Start.class&amp;rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD">Germany, meanwhile, is sa to have a shortage of about 210 000 workers</a> in what&#39;s known there as the MINT disciplines—mathematics, computer science, natural sciences, and technology.
</p><p>
	The situation is so dismal that governments everywhere are now pouring billions of dollars each year into myriad efforts designed to boost the ranks of STEM workers. President Obama has called for government and industry to train 10 000 new U.S. engineers every year as well as 
	<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/25/fact-sheet-state-union-president-obamas-plan-win-future">100 000 additional STEM teachers by 2020</a>. And until those new recruits enter the workforce, <a href="http://www.wavy.com/dpp/news/politics/congress/Hightech-pushes-for-more-in-immigration-bill_01365267">tech companies like Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft are lobbying to boost the number of H-1B visas</a>—temporary immigration permits for skilled workers—from 65 000 per year to as many as 180 000. The European Union is similarly introducing the new <a href="http://www.eubluecard.nl/eu_blue_card">Blue Card visa</a> to bring in skilled workers from outside the EU. The government of India has said it needs to add <a href="http://news.oneindia.in/2010/03/24/indianeeds-800-universities-35000-colleges-in-next-tenye.html">800 new universities</a>, in part to avoid a <a href="http://www.levininstitute.org/pdf/LevinBRICSFinal.pdf">shortfall of 1.6 million university-educated engineers</a> by the end of the decade.
</p><p>
	And yet, alongside such dire projections, you&#39;ll also find reports suggesting just the opposite—that there are more STEM workers than suitable jobs. One study found, for example, that 
	<a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/pm195-stem-labor-shortages-microsoft-report-distorts/">wages for U.S. workers in computer and math fields have largely stagnated</a> since 2000. Even as the Great Recession slowly recedes, STEM workers at every stage of the career pipeline, from freshly minted grads to mid- and late-career Ph.D.s, still struggle to find employment as many companies, including Boeing, <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/data-center/240156885/ibm-layoffs-said-to-be-widespread-throughout-company.htm">IBM</a>, and <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23452499/symantec-plans-layoffs-joining-zynga-and-netapp">Symantec</a>, continue to lay off thousands of STEM workers.
</p><p>
<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A Matter of Supply vs. Demand: Every year U.S. schools grant more STEM degrees than there are available jobs. When you factor in H-1B visa holders, existing STEM degree holders, and the like, it&#39;s hard to make a case that there&#39;s a STEM labor shortage.</small>
</p><p>
	To parse the simultaneous claims of both a shortage and a surplus of STEM workers, we&#39;ll need to delve into the data behind the debate, how it got going more than a half century ago, and the societal, economic, and nationalistic biases that have perpetuated it. And what that dissection reveals is that there is indeed a STEM crisis—just not the one everyone&#39;s been talking about. The real STEM crisis is one of literacy: the fact that today&#39;s students are not receiving a solid grounding in science, math, and engineering.
</p><p>
<strong>In preparing this article,</strong> I went through hundreds of reports, articles, and white papers from the past six decades. There were plenty of data, but there was also an extraordinary amount of inconsistency. Who exactly is a STEM worker: somebody with a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher in a STEM discipline? Somebody whose job requires use of a STEM subject? What about someone who manages STEM workers? And which disciplines and industries fall under the STEM umbrella?
</p><p>
	Such definitions obviously affect the counts. For example, in the United States, both the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Commerce track the number of STEM jobs, but using different metrics. According to Commerce, 
	<a href="http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/documents/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf">7.6 million individuals worked in STEM jobs in 2010</a>, or about 5.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. That number includes professional and technical support occupations in the fields of computer science and mathematics, engineering, and life and physical sciences as well as management. The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13311/">NSF, by contrast, counts 12.4 million</a> science and engineering jobs in the United States, including a number of areas that the Commerce Department excludes, such as health-care workers (4.3 million) and psychologists and social scientists (518 000).
</p><p>Such inconsistencies don&#39;t just create confusion for numbers junkies like me; they also make rational policy discussions difficult. Depending on your point of view, you can easily cherry-pick data to bolster your argument.
</p><p>Another surprise was the apparent mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job. Of the 7.6 million STEM workers counted by the Commerce Department, only 3.3 million possess STEM degrees. Viewed another way, about 15 million U.S. residents hold at least a bachelor&#39;s degree in a STEM discipline, but three-fourths of them—11.4 million—work outside of STEM.
</p><p>The departure of STEM graduates to other fields starts early. In 2008, the NSF surveyed STEM graduates who&#39;d earned bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees in 2006 and 2007. It found that
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf12328/content.cfm?pub_id=4169&amp;id=2">2 out of 10 were already working in non-STEM fields</a>. And 10 years after receiving a STEM degree, <a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/stem-complete.pdf">58 percent of STEM graduates had left the field</a>, according to a 2011 study from Georgetown University.
</p><p>The takeaway? At least in the United States, you don&#39;t need a STEM degree to get a STEM job, and if you do get a degree, you won&#39;t necessarily work in that field after you graduate. If there is in fact a STEM worker shortage, wouldn&#39;t you expect more people with STEM degrees to be filling those jobs? And if many STEM jobs can be filled by people who don&#39;t have STEM degrees, then why the big push to get more students to pursue STEM?
</p><p>Now consider the projections that suggest a STEM worker shortfall. One of the most cited in recent U.S. debates comes from the 2011 Georgetown University report mentioned above, by Anthony P. Carnevale, Nicole Smith, and Michelle Melton of the 
	<a href="http://cew.georgetown.edu/">Center on Education and the Workforce</a>. It estimated there will be slightly more than 2.4 million STEM job openings in the United States between 2008 and 2018, with 1.1 million newly created jobs and the rest to replace workers who retire or move to non-STEM fields; they conclude that there will be roughly 277 000 STEM vacancies per year.
</p><p>But the Georgetown study did not fully account for the Great Recession. It projected a downturn in 2009 but then a steady increase in jobs beginning in 2010 and a return to normal by the year 2018. In fact, though, 
	<a href="http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-h-b-visas-be-easier-to-get/h-1b-visas-a-symptom-of-special-interest-influence-in-dc">more than 370 000 science and engineering jobs in the United States were lost in 2011</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</p><p>I don&#39;t mean to single out this study for criticism; it just illustrates the difficulty of accurately predicting STEM demand and supply even a year or two out, let alone over a prolonged period. Highly competitive science- and technology-driven industries are volatile, where radical restructurings and 
	<a href="http://www.todaysengineer.org/2003/Aug/Unemployment.pdf">boom-and-bust cycles have been the norm</a> for decades. Many STEM jobs today are also <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32292.pdf">targets for outsourcing</a> or <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/03/141949820/how-technology-is-eliminating-higher-skill-jobs">replacement by automation</a>.
</p><p>The nature of STEM work has also changed dramatically in the past several decades. In engineering, for instance, your job is no longer linked to a company but to a funded project. Long-term employment with a single company has been replaced by a series of de facto temporary positions that can quickly end when a project ends or the market shifts. To be sure, engineers in the 1950s were sometimes laid off during recessions, but they expected to be hired back when the economy picked up. That rarely happens today. And unlike in decades past, 
	<a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/story/2012-08-09/job-training/56922438/1">employers seldom offer generous education and training</a> benefits to engineers to keep them current, so out-of-work engineers find they quickly become technologically obsolete.
</p><p>Any of these factors can affect both short-term and longer-term demand for STEM workers, as well as for the particular skills those workers will need. The agencies that track science and engineering employment know this to be true. Buried in Chapter 3 of a 
	<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c3/c3s.htm">2012 NSF workforce study</a>, for instance, you&#39;ll find this caveat: &#34;Projections of employment growth are plagued by uncertain assumptions and are notoriously difficult to make.&#34;
</p><p>
<strong>So is there a shortfall</strong> of STEM workers or isn&#39;t there?
</p><p>The Georgetown study estimates that nearly
</p><p>
<a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/stem-execsum.pdf">two-thirds of the STEM job openings</a> [PDF] in the United States, or about 180 000 jobs per year, will require bachelor&#39;s degrees. Now, if you apply the Commerce Department&#39;s definition of STEM to the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind/">NSF&#39;s annual count of science and engineering bachelor&#39;s degrees</a>, that means about 252 000 STEM graduates emerged in 2009. So even if all the STEM openings were entry-level positions and even if only new STEM bachelor&#39;s holders could compete for them, that still leaves 70 000 graduates unable to get a job in their chosen field.
</p><p>Of course, the pool of U.S. STEM workers is much bigger than that: It includes new STEM master&#39;s and Ph.D. graduates (in 2009, 
	<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/append/c2/at02-01.pdf">around 80 000 and 25 000, respectively)</a>, STEM associate degree graduates (about 40 000), H-1B visa holders (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/indicators/appendix">more than 50 000</a>), other immigrants and visa holders with STEM degrees, technical certificate holders, and non-STEM degree recipients looking to find STEM-related work. And then there&#39;s the vast number of STEM degree holders who graduated in previous years or decades.
</p><p>Even in the computer and IT industry, the sector that employs the most STEM workers and is expected to grow the most over the next 5 to 10 years, not everyone who wants a job can find one. A recent 
	<a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/bp359-guestworkers-high-skill-labor-market-analysis/">study by the Economic Policy Institute</a> (EPI), a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C., found that more than a third of recent computer science graduates aren&#39;t working in their chosen major; of that group, almost a third say the reason is that there are no jobs available.
</p><p>Spot shortages for certain STEM specialists do crop up. For instance, the recent explosion in data analytics has sparked demand for 
	<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation">data scientists</a> in health care and retail. But the H-1B visa and similar immigrant hiring programs are meant to address such shortages. The problem is that students who are contemplating what field to specialize in can&#39;t assume such shortages will still exist by the time they emerge from the educational pipeline.
</p><p>What&#39;s perhaps most perplexing about the claim of a STEM worker shortage is that many studies have directly contradicted it, including 
	<a href="http://www.issues.org/23.3/wadhwa.html">reports from Duke University</a>, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/04-22-13HiraTestimony.pdf">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, the <a href="http://rbm.nih.gov/stem/Teitelbaum.pdf">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>, and the <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG118.pdf">Rand Corp</a>. A 2004 Rand study, for example, stated that there was no evidence &#34;that such shortages have existed at least since 1990, nor that they are on the horizon.&#34;
</p><p>That report argued that the best indicator of a shortfall would be a widespread rise in salaries throughout the STEM community. But the price of labor has not risen, as you would expect it to do if STEM workers were scarce. In computing and IT, wages have generally been stagnant for the past decade, according to the EPI and other analyses. And over the past 30 years, according to the Georgetown report, engineers&#39; and engineering technicians&#39; wages have grown the least of all STEM wages and also more slowly than those in non-STEM fields; while STEM workers as a group have seen wages rise 33 percent and non-STEM workers&#39; wages rose by 23 percent, engineering salaries grew by just 18 percent. The situation is even more grim for those who get a Ph.D. in science, math, or engineering. The Georgetown study states it succinctly: &#34;At the highest levels of educational attainment, STEM wages are not competitive.&#34;
</p><p>Given all of the above, it is difficult to make a case that there has been, is, or will soon be a STEM labor shortage. &#34;If there was really a STEM labor market crisis, you&#39;d be seeing very different behaviors from companies,&#34; notes Ron Hira, an associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, in New York state. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t see companies cutting their retirement contributions, or hiring new workers and giving them worse benefits packages. Instead you would see signing bonuses, you&#39;d see wage increases. You would see these companies really training their incumbent workers.&#34;
</p><p>&#34;None of those things are observable,&#34; Hira says. &#34;In fact, they&#39;re operating in the opposite way.&#34;
</p><p>
<strong>So why the persistent</strong> anxiety that a STEM crisis exists? Michael S. Teitelbaum, a Wertheim Fellow at Harvard Law School and a senior advisor to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, has studied the phenomenon, and he says that in the United States the anxiety dates back to World War II. Ever since then it has tended to run in cycles that he calls &#34;alarm, boom, and bust.&#34; He says the cycle usually starts when &#34;someone or some group sounds the alarm that there is a critical crisis of insufficient numbers of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians&#34; and as a result the country &#34;is in jeopardy of either a national security risk or of falling behind economically.&#34; In the 1950s, he notes, Americans worried that the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v033n015.p1522">Soviet Union was producing 95 000 scientists and engineers</a> a year while the United States was producing only about 57 000. In the 1980s, it was the perceived Japanese economic juggernaut that was the threat, and now it is China and India.
</p><p>You&#39;ll hear similar arguments made elsewhere. In India, the director general of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Vijay Kumar Saraswat, recently noted that in his country, &#34;<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/india-facing-shortage-of-engineers-in-st-drdo-dg/article4356570.ece">a meagre four persons out of every 1000 are choosing S&amp;T or research</a>, as compared to 110 in Japan, 76 in Germany and Israel, 55 in USA, 46 in Korea and 8 in China.&#34; Leaders in South Africa and Brazil cite similar statistics to show how they are likewise falling behind in the STEM race.
</p><p>&#34;The government responds either with money [for research] or, more recently, with visas to increase the number of STEM workers,&#34; Teitelbaum says. &#34;This continues for a number of years until the claims of a shortage turn out not to be true and a bust ensues.&#34; Students who graduate during the bust, he says, are shocked to discover that &#34;they can&#39;t find jobs, or they find jobs but not stable ones.&#34;
</p><p>At the moment, we&#39;re in the alarm-heading-toward-boom part of the cycle. According to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. government spends more than 
	<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-529T">US $3 billion each year on 209 STEM-related initiatives</a> overseen by 13 federal agencies. That&#39;s about $100 for every U.S. student beyond primary school. In addition, major corporations are collectively spending millions to support STEM educational programs. And every U.S. state, along with a host of public and private universities, high schools, middle schools, and even primary schools, has its own STEM initiatives. The result is that many people&#39;s fortunes are now tied to the STEM crisis, real or manufactured.
</p><p>
<strong>Clearly, powerful forces</strong> must be at work to perpetuate the cycle. One is obvious: the bottom line. Companies would rather not pay STEM professionals high salaries with lavish benefits, offer them training on the job, or guarantee them decades of stable employment. So having an oversupply of workers, whether domestically educated or imported, is to their benefit. It gives employers a larger pool from which they can pick the &#34;best and the brightest,&#34; and it helps keep wages in check. No less an authority than Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said as much when in 2007 he advocated boosting the number of skilled immigrants entering the United States so as <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/03/14/greenspan_let_more_skilled_immigrants_in/">to &#34;suppress&#34; the wages of their U.S. </a>counterparts, which he considered too high.
</p><p>Governments also push the STEM myth because an abundance of scientists and engineers is widely viewed as an 
	<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/14/stem-jobs-help-america-win-future">important engine for innovation and also for national defense</a>. And the perception of a STEM crisis benefits higher education, says Ron Hira, because as &#34;taxpayers subsidize more STEM education, that works in the interest of the universities&#34; by allowing them to expand their enrollments.
</p><p>An oversupply of STEM workers may also have a beneficial effect on the economy, says Georgetown&#39;s Nicole Smith, one of the coauthors of the 2011 STEM study. If STEM graduates can&#39;t find traditional STEM jobs, she says, &#34;they will end up in other sectors of the economy and be productive.&#34;
</p><p>The problem with proclaiming a STEM shortage when one doesn&#39;t exist is that such claims can actually create a shortage down the road, Teitelbaum says. When previous STEM cycles hit their &#34;bust&#34; phase, up-and-coming students took note and steered clear of those fields, as happened in computer science after the dot-com bubble burst in 2001.
</p><p>Emphasizing STEM at the expense of other disciplines carries other risks. Without a good grounding in the arts, literature, and history, STEM students narrow their worldview—and their career options.
</p><p>
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576568351324914730.html">In a 2011 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Norman Augustine</a>, former chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin, argued that point. &#34;In my position as CEO of a firm employing over 80 000 engineers, I can testify that most were excellent engineers,&#34; he wrote. &#34;But the factor that most distinguished those who advanced in the organization was the ability to think broadly and read and write clearly.&#34;
</p><p>A broader view, I and many others would argue, is that everyone needs a solid grounding in science, engineering, and math. In that sense, there is indeed a shortage—a STEM knowledge shortage. To fill that shortage, you don&#39;t necessarily need a college or university degree in a STEM discipline, but you do need to learn those subjects, and learn them well, from childhood until you head off to college or get a job. Improving everyone&#39;s STEM skills would clearly be good for the workforce and for people&#39;s employment prospects, for public policy debates, and for everyday tasks like balancing checkbooks and calculating risks. And, of course, when science, math, and engineering are taught well, they engage students&#39; intellectual curiosity about the world and how it works.
</p><p>Many children born today are likely to live to be 100 and to have not just one distinct career but two or three by the time they retire at 80. Rather than spending our scarce resources on ending a mythical STEM shortage, we should figure out how to make all children literate in the sciences, technology, and the arts to give them the best foundation to pursue a career and then transition to new ones. And instead of continuing our current global obsession with STEM shortages, industry and government should focus on creating more STEM jobs that are enduring and satisfying as well.

      <p>Today, oxygen fuels much of life on Earth, but it wasn’t always that way. Three billion years ago, this gas was scarce in the atmosphere and oceans. Knowing why oxygen became plentiful could illuminate the evolution of our planet’s flora and fauna, but scientists have struggled to find an explanation satisfying to all. Now a research team has proposed a novel link between how fast our planet spun on its axis, which defines the length of a day, and the ancient production of additional oxygen. Their modeling of Earth’s early days, which incorporates evidence from microbial mats coating the bottom of a shallow, sunlit sinkhole in Lake Huron, produced a surprising conclusion: as Earth’s spin slowed, the resulting longer days could have triggered more photosynthesis from similar mats, allowing oxygen to build up in ancient seas and diffuse up into the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00784-3">That proposal</a>, described today in <cite>Nature Geoscience</cite>, has intrigued some scientists. “The rise of oxygen [on Earth] is easily the most substantial environmental change in the history of our planet,” says Woodward Fischer, a geobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved with the work. This study offers “a totally new flavor of an idea. It’s making a connection that people haven’t made before.”</p>

<p>Earth was much different when life first took hold about 4  billion years  ago, with vast shallow seas whose only living creatures were one-celled. Many of those early microbes were cyanobacteria, which can form mats on sediments and rock surfaces and today sometimes cause algal blooms deadly to fish and other aquatic animals. Microbes that became cyanobacteria evolved the molecular machinery for photosynthesis early on, letting them convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen. Researchers have long thought these microbes provided Earth’s initial supply of oxygen, over the eons creating an environment that favored the evolution of aerobic life in all its forms. But they always puzzled over why about a billion years passed between the first photosynthetic microbes, which fossils indicate arose about 3.5 billion years ago, and the first good geological evidence for a buildup of oxygen.</p>

<p>Researchers already knew, from modeling the Moon’s distance from Earth and the resulting atmospheric and oceanic tides, that the infant Earth turned much faster on its axis than it does today. Many agree that 4.5 billion years ago, a day was only about 6 hours long. By about 2.4 billion years ago, the models predict, the pull of the Moon had slowed that spin to about a 21-hour day. Earth’s rotational speed then stayed constant for about a billion years, as its gravitational pull countered the Moon’s drag. Those forces fell out of balance about 700 million years ago, because the resonance cycle between Earth and the Moon is not completely stable, and the planet’s spin slowed to its current speed, creating a 24-hour day, according to the models</p>

<p>In 2016, after a chance suggestion, Judith Klatt, a biogeochemist now at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, realized those slowdowns in Earth’s rate of spin mirrored big leaps in atmospheric oxygen. For example, oxygen first jumped during what’s called the Great Oxygenation Event, some 2.4 billion years ago, and then again during the Neoproterozoic era, more than a billion years later. During the Paleozoic, about 400 million years ago, there was a final major increase in atmospheric oxygen.  </p>

<p>As a postdoc at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Klatt had studied microbial mats growing on sediments in the Middle Island Sinkhole in Lake Huron. There, the water is shallow enough for the cyanobacteria to get enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Oxygen-depleted water and sulfur gas bubble up from the lake floor, creating anoxic conditions that roughly approximate conditions of early Earth.</p>

<p>Scuba divers collected samples of the microbial mats and in the lab, Klatt tracked the amount of oxygen they released under various day lengths simulated with halogen lamps. The longer the exposure to light, the more of the gas the mats released. </p>

<p>Excited, Klatt and Arjun Chennu, a modeler from the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research, set up a numerical model to calculate how much oxygen ancient cyanobacteria could have produced on a global scale. When the microbial mat results and other data were plugged into this computer program, it revealed a key interaction between light exposure and the microbial mats.</p>

<p>Typically, microbial mats “breathe” in almost as much oxygen at night as they produce during the day. But as Earth’s spin slowed, the additional continuous hours of daylight allowed the simulated mats to build up a surplus, releasing oxygen into the water. As a result, atmospheric oxygen tracked estimated day length over the eons: Both rose in a stepped fashion with a long plateau.</p>
  
  <figure>
    <h2>Did longer days fuel oxygen rise?</h2>
  <figcaption><p>Models suggest the amount of oxygen on Earth increased in a stepwise fashion, starting with the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) about 2.4 billion years ago, followed by a plateau for a &#34;boring billion&#34; years. Oxygen rose again in the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE) and Palaeozoic Oxidation Event (POE). Day length rose in the same stepped pattern, suggesting that the added light boosted photosynthetic microbes, fueling increases in oxygen.</p>

      <p>This “elegant” idea helps explain why oxygen didn’t build up in the atmosphere as soon as cyanobacteria appeared on the scene 3.5 billion years ago, says Timothy Lyons, a biogeochemist at the University of California, Riverside. Because day length was still so short back then, oxygen in the mats never had a chance to build up enough to diffuse out. “Long daytimes simply allow more oxygen to escape to the overlying waters and eventually the atmosphere,” Lyons says.</p>

<p>Still, Lyons and others say, many factors likely contributed to the rise in oxygen. For example, Fischer suspects free-floating cyanobacteria, not just those in rock-affixed mats, were big players. Benjamin Mills, an Earth system modeler at the University of Leeds, thinks the release of oxygen-binding minerals by ancient volcanoes likely countered the early buildup of the gas at times and should be factored into oxygen calculations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, changing day length “is something that should be considered in more detail,” he says. “I&#39;ll try to add it to our Earth system models.”</p>

      <title>Use Phoenix Channels</title>

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___info_codecast_io_blog_how-to-use-phoenix-channels/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍</p><p>Chris McCord showed how<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Duii6Yog0"> a single Phoenix server could power a million connections</a>. That means a million people send and receive messages in a chat application powered only by a single physical server.</p><p>Phoenix is industry-leading when it comes to scalability and real-time systems.</p><h3>What is a real-time system?</h3><p>You might be more familiar with a typical one-way server request. The client requests information from the server, and the server responds.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>WebSockets</h3><p>Websockets allow for direct two-way communication between the client and server. Therefore, for most real-time applications, WebSockets are preferable.</p><p>At any point, the client or the server can send a message to the other. Websockets are the default method of real-time communication in Phoenix.</p><h3>Long polling</h3><p>Long polling is another less popular communication protocol for real-time features often used when clients have a poor internet connection. Long polling is a continuous cycle of request and response rather than open two-way communication.</p><p>The client establishes a connection. The connection then remains open until the server times out or responds. The client then reestablishes a connection, and the cycle continues.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This allows the server to control when to update the client and benefits clients with poor internet connections.</p><blockquote>&#34;A client can change from WebSocket to long polling if something goes wrong, such as poor network connectivity.&#34; - Pragmatic Programmer</blockquote><h3>Phoenix Channels</h3><p>Channels are an exciting part of Phoenix that enable soft real-time communication with and between millions of connected clients.</p><p>Some possible use cases include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Chat rooms and APIs for messaging apps</li><li>Breaking news, like “a goal was scored” or “an earthquake is coming”</li><li>Tracking trains, trucks, or race participants on a map</li><li>Events in multiplayer games</li><li>Monitoring sensors and controlling lights</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Phoenix Channel Documentation</a></li></ul><p>Some other use cases include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Collaborative documents</li><li>Unified cross-tab experience. For example, a shopping cart that updates even across multiple tabs.</li></ul><p>Phoenix channels allow real-time features across many clients. Here’s what that looks like in practice.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Notice that when a message is sent, it updates both browser windows.</p><h3>Phoenix Real-time Infrastructure</h3><p>When you generate a new phoenix project</p><p><strong>mix phx.new app</strong></p><p>Phoenix provides everything you need to get started with real-time features. The important pieces to know are the Endpoint, Socket, Topic, and Channel.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Endpoint</h3><p>Defines a Phoenix endpoint.</p><p>The endpoint is the boundary where all requests to your web application start. It is also the interface your application provides to the underlying web servers.</p><p>Overall, an endpoint has three responsibilities:</p><ul role="list"><li>to provide a wrapper for starting and stopping the endpoint as part of a supervision tree</li><li>to define an initial plug pipeline for requests to pass through</li><li>to host web specific configuration for your application</li></ul><p> -  Phoenix Endpoint Documentation</p><p>In your Phoenix application in the <strong>endpoint.ex</strong> file, you’ll notice the Endpoint sets up the user socket by default. It also sets up a LiveView socket, but we’ll focus on the user socket.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>The Socket</h3><p>The socket ties transports and channels together. </p><p>By default, Phoenix uses WebSockets instead of long-polling, but it comes with support for both. Notice websockets: true and longpolling: false in the socket method.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Sockets must define two callbacks, <strong>connect</strong> and <strong>id</strong> . These callbacks are used to authenticate and identify socket connections.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The socket manages the different channels in your Phoenix application. You can connect a channel under a particular context using the built-in channel method provided by the <strong>Phoenix.Socket</strong> module. The channel method takes in two values, the context for messages and the Channel module to handle messages under that context.</p><p>For example, here’s how to connect all messages under the chat context to the <strong>ChatChannel</strong>. The asterisk <strong>* </strong>is a wildcard. This means the <strong>ChatChannel</strong> handles all events under the chat topic.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><h3>The Channel </h3><p>To create a new channel, you can use the<strong> mix phx.gen.channel &lt;ChannelName&gt; </strong>command.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This generates a <strong>ChatChannel</strong> that looks like this. </p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This channel is responsible for handling the live communication between the client and server.</p><p>By default, generated channels contain a join method that handles connecting the client to the channel. This join method uses the <strong>authorized?</strong> method as a placeholder for any authorization logic that you might want to implement in the future. By default, all join requests are authorized.</p><p>channels use <strong>handle_in</strong> methods that handle receiving a message from a client. The first parameter of the <strong>handle_in</strong> method is an event name string to pattern match on. The client sends the same event name string so that the channel knows which<strong> handle_in</strong> method should handle the incoming message.</p><h3>The Client</h3><p>Phoenix provides a <strong>socket.js</strong> file to handle connecting to the server from the client. There you will find some boilerplate code to handle connecting to a channel.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Change that code to match your topic and subtopic. This should match the string you used for the channel’s join method.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Import the socket in your <strong>app.js</strong> file.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Start your phoenix project using <strong>mix phx.server</strong> and open up your browser console (usually f12), and you’ll see that you’re joining successfully.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><h3><strong>Sending Messages</strong></h3><p>You can send messages using the <strong>channel.push()</strong> method</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><h3>Receiving Messages</h3><p>You can handle receiving messages using the <strong>channel.on</strong> method.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>channel.on </strong>gets triggered by the broadcast method inside of the Phoenix Channel.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Here’s what that looks like if you add both methods to the <strong>socket.js</strong> file.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Now you’ll see the following in your browser console:</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><h3>Intercepting Messages</h3><p>You can intercept messages using the <strong>handle_out</strong> method in the Phoenix Channel. You can override values, perform authentication, or add additional information.</p><p>The<strong> handle_out</strong> method is triggered whenever the broadcast method is called by the <strong>handle_in </strong>method with the same event string. In this case, “shout.”</p><p>You also have to include the event name in an intercept call inside of the Phoenix Channel.</p><p>To push the message to the client inside of the <strong>handle_out</strong> method use the push method.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>‍</p><figure><p></p></figure><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Now you know everything you need to know to handle receiving, sending, and intercepting messages using Phoenix Channels.</p><p>If you’d like to know more about what you can do with Phoenix Channels, then the<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Channel.html"> Phoenix Documentation</a> is a great place to start!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mvp-content-main"><p>Researchers from Israel have developed a neural network capable of generating ‘master’ faces – facial images that are each capable of impersonating multiple IDs. The work suggests that it’s possible to generate such ‘master keys’ for more than 40% of the population using only 9 faces synthesized by the StyleGAN Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), via three leading face recognition systems.</p><p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01077.pdf">paper</a> is a collaboration between the Blavatnik School of Computer Science and the school of Electrical Engineering, both at Tel Aviv.</p><p>Testing the system, the researchers found that a single generated face could unlock 20% of all identities in the University of Massachusetts’ Labeled Faces in the Wild (<a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/">LFW</a>) open source database, a common repository used for development and testing of facial ID systems, and the benchmark database for the Israeli system.</p><div id="attachment_176962"><p></p><p id="caption-attachment-176962"><em>The Israeli system workflow, which uses the StyleGAN generator to iteratively seek out ‘master faces’.</em> Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01077.pdf</p></div><p>The new method improves on a similar <a href="https://www.unite.ai/a-universal-facial-id-master-key-through-machine-learning/">recent paper</a> from the University of Siena, which requires a privileged level of access to the <a href="https://www.unite.ai/what-is-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> framework. By contrast, the new method infers generalized features from publicly available material and uses it to create facial characteristics that straddle a vast number of identities.</p><h3><strong>Evolving Master Faces</strong></h3><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf">StyleGAN</a> is initially used in this approach under a black box optimization method focusing (unsurprisingly) on high dimensional data, since it’s important to find the broadest and most generalized facial features that will satisfy an authentication system.</p><p>This process is then repeated iteratively to encompass identities that were not encoded in the initial pass. In varying test conditions, the researchers found that it was possible to obtain authentication for 40-60% with only nine generated images.</p><div id="attachment_176963"><p><a href="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs-M8dyDKvP/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/master-faces.jpg"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-176963"><em>Successive groups of ‘master faces’ obtained in the research across various Coverage Search methods, including LM-MA-ES.

Though this is well-suited to the intent of the project, an additional component is needed to deduce which faces are the best candidates for cross-identity authentication. Therefore the researchers created a ‘Success Predictor’ neural classifier to sieve the flood of candidates into the best-fit faces for the task.</p><div id="attachment_176965"><p></p><p id="caption-attachment-176965"><em>Rationale of the Success Predictor used in the Israeli facial identification spoofing project.</em></p></div><h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3><p>The system was tested against three CNN-based face descriptors: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08063.pdf">SphereFace</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf">FaceNet</a> and <a href="https://www.scalr.ai/post/facial-detection-and-recognition-with-dlib">Dlib</a>, each system architecture containing a similarity metric and a loss function, which are useful in validating the system’s accuracy scores.</p><p>Success Predictor is a <a href="https://www.unite.ai/what-are-neural-networks/">feed-forward neural network</a> comprising three fully-connected layers.

The network uses <a href="https://medium.com/@nishantnikhil/adam-optimizer-notes-ddac4fd7218">ADAM</a> as the optimizer, with an ambitious learning rate of 0.001 over batches of 32 input images.</p><div id="attachment_176966"><p></p><p id="caption-attachment-176966"><em>Output from the three architectures.</em></p></div><p>All three algorithms tested were trained for 26,400 fitness function calls using the same set of five seeds.</p><p>The researchers had established by this point that longer training processes did not benefit the system; effectively, the Israeli approach is seeking to derive key data from an early stage of model training, where only the highest features have yet been discerned. It’s worth noting that this is something of a gift, in terms of framework economy.</p><p>Having established baseline results with Facebook’s Python-based <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad">NeverGrad</a> gradient-free optimization environment, the system was profiled against a number of  algorithms, including various brands of the <a href="https://www.metabolic-economics.de/pages/seminar_theoretische_biologie_2007/literatur/schaber/Storn1997JGlobOpt11.pdf">Differential Evolution</a> heuristic.</p><p>The researchers found that a ‘greedy’ approach based on Dlib outperformed its competitors, succeeding in creating nine master faces capable of unlocking 42%-64% of the test dataset. Application of the system’s Success Predictor further improved these very favorable results.</p><p>The paper contends that ‘face based authentication is extremely vulnerable, even if there is no information on the target identity’, and the researchers consider their initiative a valid approach to a security incursion methodology for facial recognition systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Julian Assange: peering through the murk</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_lawgazette_co_uk_commentary-and-opinion_julian-assange-peering-through-the-murk_5109400_article/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>
					
					<div><p>If Julian Assange is extradited to the United States and convicted of any of the charges he faces there – such as unauthorised obtaining of national defence information – the US government will let him serve his sentence in an Australian prison.</p>
<div data-attachment="98594" data-sequence="3">
<p></p>

<p>Julian Assange</p></div>
<p>The US has also agreed that, as things stand, the Wikileaks founder will not be held at the administrative maximum security prison near Florence, Colorado, known as ADX. Nor will he be subject to special administrative measures designed to prevent the disclosure of classified information – such as limits on correspondence, visits and telephone calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if, as Swift has held, the US has raised ‘arguable issues that should be considered at a final hearing’, lawyers with clients currently facing extradition to the US need to know – now – precisely what these are</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be a game-changer. An application by the US government for Assange’s extradition was dismissed in January because a court in London had found it would be oppressive to extradite him to a country where he might face these restrictions. District Judge Baraitser was persuaded that if he was subjected to the ‘extreme conditions’ of special administrative measures, ‘Assange’s mental health will deteriorate to the point where he will commit suicide’.</p>
<p>But Assange remains in prison. The district judge refused him bail after the US government said it would seek to appeal to the High Court against her decision. And on 5 July Mr Justice Swift granted the US permission on three of the five grounds set out in its application for permission to appeal.</p>
<p>What were those? This is where the story becomes murky.</p>
<p>The judge’s two-page order, which has not been published but is readily available from the court, explains briefly why he refused the US permission to appeal on grounds 3 and 4. It says nothing about Swift’s reasons for granting permission on grounds 1, 2 and 5.</p>
<p>That’s not a problem as far as the parties are concerned: they know what the grounds of appeal were. And when the appeal is heard – this autumn or next year – we shall find out too. But if, as Swift has held, the US has raised ‘arguable issues that should be considered at a final hearing’, lawyers with clients currently facing extradition to the US need to know – now – precisely what these are.</p>
<p>Foreign governments seeking extradition are represented by the Crown Prosecution Service. I asked the CPS for a copy of the application they had filed for permission to appeal. They refused to let me see it. Instead, they suggested I asked the High Court. The court told me I needed to make a written application to the judge and pay a fee of £255. I was not willing to do so – it raises concerns about access to justice data that were the subject of an important report by the Legal Education Foundation last month – and I have not been able to get hold of a copy in any other way.</p>
<p>After further requests, the CPS agreed to send me an informal briefing note that had been supplied to other journalists shortly after Swift’s ruling. This note, which includes a minor inaccuracy, is the source of all media reports and legal commentaries on the judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>The first arguable ground, according to this note, was that Baraitser had made errors of law in applying the test under section 91 of the Extradition Act 2003. This says that if the physical or mental condition of a suspect ‘is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him’, the judge must either order his or her discharge or adjourn the hearing until he or she is better. We don’t know what Baraitser’s alleged errors were.</p>
<p>The second arguable ground is that, having decided that the threshold for discharge was met, Baraitser should have notified the requesting state of her provisional view and given the US a chance to offer assurances.</p>
<p>The third arguable ground – ground 5 – was that the US has now provided the UK with the assurances I summarised earlier.</p>
<p>The two grounds on which permission was refused related to the evidence of a defence psychiatrist and the risk of suicide. Swift said that Baraitser’s findings were reasonably open to her and her conclusions on the disputed evidence were also reasonable. The matters referred to in the application for permission to appeal – we have no idea what these were – ‘are no more than an attempt to re-run determination of the evidential disputes reached by the district judge’.</p>
<p>Nick Vamos, an extradition partner at Peters &amp; Peters, said the apparent willingness of the US authorities to provide specific assurances – which they have resisted in the past – may signify the importance they place on this case. Alternatively, it may ‘simply be the US bowing pragmatically to the inevitability that bespoke assurances are now an indispensable part of many extradition proceedings’.</p>
<p>But it’s the details that matter: would Assange have to remain in the US pending any appeal, for example? It may be some months before we find out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to all our new subscribers! I write a weekly newsletter, sent out every Sunday, about anything, as long as it’s interesting. If you enjoy the newsletter, please share it with a few friends/colleagues.</em></p><p>Last week, I shared a few excerpts of <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/charlie-munger/">Charlie Munger</a>’s <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/charlie-munger-the-psychology-of-human-misjudgment/">Psychology of Human Misjudgment</a> as someone had reached out saying that they thought it was a useful, albeit long, speech. That article got forwarded around a bit and resulted in one of the highest subscriber-per-view stats of any email I have sent out.</p><p>I think that means many people found it interesting.</p><p>So I thought I would do something similar again this week with another transcript that I posted on the <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/">main website</a> earlier this year — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Brodsky">Joseph Brodsky</a>’s Speech at the Stadium.</p><p>For those interested, <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/joseph-brodsky-speech-at-the-stadium/">the full speech transcript can be found here</a>. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1103534-c7b0-4901-b989-74f21cd6deef_1280x720.jpeg"></a></figure></div><h3>Who is Joseph Brodsky?</h3><p>Joseph Brodsky was a Russian poet and Noble Prize recipient.</p><p>He was born in Leningrad in 1940 and held numerous jobs following high school — working in a morgue, in a weapons factory, as a sailor, and on a geological exploration team in Asia. He started writing poetry at the age of 18, but only three years later, and while on that expedition far away from home, Brodsky decided to make poetry his full-time career and returned home to Leningrad.</p><p>Shortly thereafter he started becoming well-known in Russian literary circles, while at the same time being considered controversial. Well-known and controversial were an unfortunate combination in the Soviet Union at the time, and Brodsky found himself in and out of Soviet-run mental hospitals and prisons. </p><p>Fortunately, he was able to leave the Soviet Union in 1972 through the help of a few American poetry friends and eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1977. He went on to hold teaching positions at Columbia University and Mount Holyoke College and served as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Poet_Laureate">Poet Laureate of the United States</a> from 1991 to 1992. Further, he won the Noble Prize in Literature in 1987 for “an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity.”</p><h3>Famous Poet, You Say?</h3><p>Title: <strong>1 January 1965</strong></p><p>Translated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kline">George L.

Pay every attention to it and try to increase your earnings. The purpose here is not to boost your bedroom eloquence or your professional success — although those, too, can be consequences — nor is it to turn you into parlor sophisticates. The purpose is to enable you to articulate yourselves as fully and precisely as possible; in a word, the purpose is your balance…</p><p>On a daily basis, a lot is happening to one’s psyche; the mode of one’s expression, however, often remains the same. Articulation lags behind experience… Sentiments, nuances, thoughts, perceptions that remain nameless, unable to be voiced and dissatisfied with approximations, get pent up within an individual and may lead to a psychological explosion or implosion.</p></blockquote><h3>Make What You Can Better</h3><blockquote><p>Try not to set too much store by politicians. Not so much because they are dumb or dishonest, which is more often than not the case, but because of the size of their job, which is too big even for the best among them, by this or that political party, doctrine, system or a blueprint thereof. All they or those can do, at best, is to diminish a social evil, not eradicate it. No matter how substantial an improvement may be, ethically speaking it will always be negligible, because there will always be those — say, just one person — who won’t profit from this improvement…</p><p>No matter how fairly the man you’ve elected will promise to cut the pie, it won’t grow in size; as a matter of fact, the portions are bound to get smaller. In light of that, or, rather, in dark of that — you ought to rely on your own home cooking, that is, on managing the world yourselves — at least that part of it that lies within your reach, within your radius.</p></blockquote><h3>Focus on Being You, Not What Someone Else Is</h3><blockquote><p>To this it should be added that the rich and famous these days, too, come in throngs, that up there on the top it’s very crowded. So if you want to get rich or famous or both, by all means go ahead, but don’t make a meal of it. To covet what somebody else has is to forfeit your uniqueness; on the other hand, of course, it stimulates mass production. </p><p>But as you are running through life only once, it is only sensible to try to avoid the most obvious cliches, limited editions included. The notion of exclusivity, mind you, also forfeits your uniqueness, not to mention that it shrinks your sense of reality to the already-achieved.</p><p>Far better than belonging to any club is to be jostled by the multitudes of those who, given their income and their appearance, represent — at least theoretically — unlimited potential. Try to be more like them than like those who are not like them.</p></blockquote><h3>Do Not View Yourself as a Victim</h3><blockquote><p>Of all the parts of your body, be most vigilant over your index finger, for it is blame-thirsty. A pointed finger is a victim’s logo — the opposite of the V-sign and a synonym for surrender. No matter how abominable your condition may be, try not to blame anything or anybody: history, the state, superiors, race, parents, the phase of the moon, childhood, toilet training, etc… The moment that you place blame somewhere, you undermine your resolve to change anything; it could be argued even that that blame-thirsty finger oscillates as wildly as it does because the resolve was never great enough in the first place.</p><p>After all, a victim status is not without its sweetness. It commands compassion, confers distinction, and whole nations and continents bask in the murk of mental discounts advertised as the victim’s conscience — but try to resist it. However abundant and irrefutable is the evidence that you are on the losing side, negate it as long as you have your wits about you, as long as your lips can utter “No…”</p><p>On the whole, try to respect life not only for its amenities but for its hardships, too. They are a part of the game, and what’s good about a hardship is that it is not a deception.</p></blockquote><h3>It’s OK to Let Go of People and Things</h3><blockquote><p>Try not to pay attention to those who will try to make life miserable for you. There will be a lot of those — in the official capacity as well as the self-appointed. Suffer them if you can’t escape them, but once you have steered clear of them, give them the shortest shrift possible. Above all, try to avoid telling stories about the unjust treatment you received at their hands; avoid it no matter how receptive your audience may be…</p><p>What your foes do derives its significance or consequence from the way you react. Therefore, rush through or past them as though they were yellow and not red lights. Don’t linger on them mentally or verbally; don’t pride yourself on forgiving or forgetting them — worse come to worse, do the forgetting first.</p></blockquote><p>If you made it all the way through the article, please take a moment to share it with someone that might find it interesting, or consider becoming a supporter of the newsletter by being a paying subscriber — I appreciate your support and interest in the newsletter very much.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/speech-at-the-stadium?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/speech-at-the-stadium?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Take care and have a great rest of the week,</p><p>— EJ</p><h3>See <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/">here</a> for an archive of recent newsletter articles</h3><p>A few selected examples…</p><h3><a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/an-attack-on-pearl-harbor">We Only Ever Talk About the Third Attack on Pearl Harbor</a></h3><p>“It was a winter Sunday morning and the island of Oahu was asleep — its military at Pearl Harbor less alert than they might have been any other day of the week.</p><p>The winter trade winds blow steadily from the northeast against the Hawaiian island, rushing along and then up and over the 3,000-foot Koolau Range, with the moisture they carry being wrung out along the way.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    
    
<p>Nearly ten years ago I graduated with a degree in Mathematics &amp; Computing, with a keen interest in pursuing a career involving maths and programming, but with little idea how. First and foremost I had decided to stay in Manchester after uni, rather than risk getting stuck at my parents’ if I moved back home. So I rented a flat with a friend from uni and started looking for a job. I had spent a lot of time at uni learning web development – not so much from the course, but self-taught as the course was quite far behind. I was happily making websites with the LAMP stack, I felt pretty capable at it and I knew there were plenty of such jobs in the Manchester area – so I started applying for “Web developer” and “PHP developer” and similar positions in all sorts of local companies.</p>



<p>The first interview I had was a general developer job in a small company in Stockport – the job required Microsoft Access experience, and for some reason this was still something I considered myself to have, and was willing to promise to others I had, which baffles me now. I ended up having a really great chat with the company boss at the interview. He asked some great interview questions about data analysis, and we spent about 90 minutes in conversation – he was fascinated by what I’d studied at uni – particularly data visualisation and dynamical systems &amp; chaos. I did get offered the job but he was too late – I’d already had my second interview and they asked me to start immediately.</p>



<p>My second interview was with a company called <em>App Start</em> in an office building in an old fashioned industrial estate in a horrible part of Salford (if you think of Media City as <em>Salford</em>, the rest Salford would be a shock). I was pushing it for time due to underestimating the walk from the train station, and I arrived a bit flustered from the rush and trying to find the place. I was greeted by a man in beach shorts and flip-flops. I was dressed in a full suit, shirt, tie and smart shoes, and I told him “I’m here for an interview with Chris” – his response “Oh, Chris doesn’t work here any more” should have set off alarm bells, but hey, I was young and naive.</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<div><figure><figcaption>Clifton Business Park, Salford. The real factory of dreams.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The guy in flip-flops, Alex, seemed to be in charge now. He asked which role I’d applied for – I said “web developer” and he invited me in. There were about 15-20 people working at desktop PCs. There was a big sofa. The floor was bare concrete. In between whiteboards with passwords written on them you could see the walls were graffitied. The “interview” involved him trying to find my CV in Chris’s inbox, and me showing him some websites I’d made. He asked if I could come in the next day, to do a day’s work as a trial – so I did.</p>



<p>The next day was a Friday – and I seem to recall building a prototype of a social networking site – although I’m not sure why. Anyway – he seemed to think I was good enough so he offered me the job – starting on Monday – which was great for me – I’d landed a full-time job starting straight away, meaning I could pay the rent and start my post-uni life in Manchester. But once I accepted, he asked “are you free tomorrow?” – I hesitated but answered the question – “yes”. “Can you come in?” and because I wasn’t sure what else to say, I said yes. Again, this should have been a sign.</p>



<p>The owner was a young entrepreneur called Andrew, who I was told had made millions through his property development and management company, <em>Fresh Start Living</em>. He decided to get into the “app” market (remember, this was 2011 – iPhone apps were huge) and so he’d decided to give his IT guy (Alex) a budget to hire some developers to make a load of apps. Surely one of them would be a huge success and he’d make millions.</p>



<h2>Monday to Friday? 9 to 5?</h2>



<p>I went back again on the Saturday to find no sign of anyone in the office. I waited around a bit but didn’t know what to do. I didn’t have a contact number for Alex. After a while, he showed up. He’d been in the Fresh Start Living side of the building. We did a day’s work on our own in the office. He gave me a lift home and I was due to start work for real on the Monday.</p>



<p>I arrived on Monday, and was told about the project I’d be working on. The short version is that I was told we had to have it finished before anyone could go home. We were there until 9pm. That was my first day as a full-time employee.</p>

<h2>Skill Buy</h2>



<p>So on my first day, Alex told me the project I’d be working on was called <em>Skill Buy</em>, and proceeded to explain the concept. The idea was similar to an auction site that was popular at the time where you could bid on a product, but you paid for every bid – so if you saw an iPhone with a winning bid of 1p, you could bid 2p, but if you were outbid, you’d lost your 2p – eventually someone would win it at a bargain price at the expense of everyone who’d bid before them and the company would make a fortune. They’re called penny auctions and you can read about them in this paper: <em><a href="https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/26656/1/PubSub3120_Griffiths.pdf"><strong>Are online penny auctions a form of gambling?</strong></a></em> Anyway – the idea I’d been told about was similar, but instead of bidding, you’d play a game (a <em>Flash</em> or <em>Unity</em> game made by the game devs I was working with) – and it worked like an arcade game – the winner gets the prize. You’d buy credits, spend your credits playing games, and if you were the top scorer at the end of the game’s countdown timer, you’d win the prize. Actually you’d win the prize at 99% discount because they seemed to think that got around gambling laws.</p>



<p>Without a web developer on staff, getting this idea off the ground had proved tricky, and Alex had been using his own jack-of-all-trades skills to knock something together. He had some experience managing an e-commerce site (I later found out that he ran his own online sex toy shop…) so he’d put together a Skill Buy prototype using the PHP e-commerce framework <em>Magento</em>. He would add products (prizes) in the site’s admin area, and hacked away at the templates to show countdown timers and things. Somehow, Alex had promised the site would be ready to show Andrew the next day – and at some point in the afternoon he started to stress out and said to the whole room “no-one’s going home until this is done”. One of the game devs, had made a target shooting practice game in <em>Unity</em>, and we had to figure out how to embed it in the site and get the game to submit the player’s score to the site’s PHP back-end. We had no idea where to start, but we worked on it all afternoon, well into the evening, and we got it working to whatever standard Alex had required, and finally got to go home.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>The shooting range game</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Over the next few weeks I worked on the site, I grew fed up of being stuck in this e-commerce framework – having to work with its hyper-normalised MySQL database (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">EAV model</a>), and the fact the product I was building wasn’t really a shop – so I asked Alex if he minded me writing something custom instead. I got my own custom PHP/MySQL site up-and-running pretty quickly, and it didn’t take long before we launched the site. I was happy enough writing crappy PHP, implementing questionable security protections (feeble attempts to block people from sending in fake scores), and learning things like how to integrate Facebook Login, PayPal payments, using AJAX, and working with the game devs to integrate with the scoring system. I actually quite enjoyed working there for a little while! It was liberating, knowing I was using my self-taught web dev skills on my own terms – and getting paid to do so.</p>

<p>The apps company was being run by Alex and a 19-year-old kid called Liam, whose Uncle was involved in the property business. Somehow Liam had been given an experimental side-project business to help run as his “placement year” at uni.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>Skill Buy</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One thing that might strike you as odd is the bizarre graphics. The designer had made all these cow-in-a-field graphics for an iPhone game that was planned – but they’d shelved it and told her to re-use them on the website. She <em>hated </em>that they were being used like this – and it didn’t make sense to anyone else either.</p>



<p>Alex had a tendency of regularly asking if you were free on Saturday. The first few times I said yes, and just worked an extra day – I think I assumed I would automatically get paid overtime – but I didn’t. Eventually I just learned to say no.</p>



<p>A little while after I joined, a guy called Bob turned up and took some kind of product manager job, similar to Alex and Liam. Like Liam, he seemed nice enough but somewhat out of place. He was a friend of Alex’s. He used to stare at Google Analytics all day and come over and tell me things about bounce times and referrals. He used to leave after lunch, for whatever reason, so he earned the nickname <em>Half-a-job Bob.</em> He didn’t last long though. One day, he’d been in a meeting with Andrew, who’d obviously seen through him and had enough. I came to discover that when Andrew decided he didn’t like someone, rather than fire them, he’d have a go at them and make them feel so angry they’d want to leave. Bob marched through the door, slammed it behind him, muttering loudly to himself “he’s not talking to me like that” and declared to the room that he was “taking no more of Andrew’s shit” and stormed out.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure></figure></li><li><figure></figure></li><li><figure></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>We’d launched the site, and they’d started running Facebook ads promoting it. Alex even ordered a load of printed materials and signs to put up. I remember once, when giving me a lift home, he pulled up and got out of the car to cable tie a Skill Buy banner to a railing at a set of traffic lights. <a href="http://whatsthefunctionality.blogspot.com/2011/10/skillbuycouk-and-what-it-is.html">We had people playing</a> – you got a few free credits after signing up, and some were actually buying credits too. The cheaper gimmicky prizes had short timers on them, and we had winners claim prizes – which Liam shipped out. We had some big prizes on there too, like a Rolex watch, a year’s free accommodation, and a house. The idea was that Andrew could give away use of some of Fresh Start’s rental properties and even a house, if the website made enough revenue. The accommodation and the house were on a 3-month timer, and <em>surely</em> that would be enough time to build up the site user base.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>We ran a stall at the university fresher’s fair to try to get some student interest. We ran a special game where people played “Avoid the Hangover” on a projected screen to win “a mountain of beer” (or “mountin” if you saw our printed leaflets).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After a while, Andrew decided to make a change. Instead of buying credits, you would buy a ticket for a game, and only when enough people had bought a ticket would the game open, to guarantee the revenue covered the cost of the prize. This basically halted all activity on the site. Rather than people playing games and competing for prizes, they were just waiting, and hardly anyone was interested in buying tickets. It meant that the site was no longer spending any money on prizes, so it didn’t have any outgoings, but there wasn’t any sign of it getting the number of users it needed.</p>



<p>While searching my inbox for anything related to App Start, I found this email from Andrew, forwarded to me by Alex:</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi Ben – These are the skill buy changes required by andrew.</p></blockquote>



<div><figure><figcaption>One day, Andrew brought in a friend who had his own skip company – and he introduced me and said I would make him a website for his skip company.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Pigs Might Fly</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the team was working on iPhone games. There were some really talented designers and developers there – and they produced some great games they were rightly very proud of. They made a game called <em>Splat</em> (a bit like whack-a-mole) which was one of those addictive games, and they managed to get a local radio station to interview them about it. They also made a game called <em>Pigs Might Fly</em> – and they went all out with the marketing for this one. Alex got some large pig signs printed and attached them to helium balloons and sent them flying around Manchester City centre. They got everyone to text the radio station saying things like “I’ve just seen a flying pig float past my car in Manchester” and they read a few of them out and asked if anyone knew what it was about. Someone then called in to the radio show and went on air to promote the app. I’ve just found the company <a href="https://twitter.com/AppStartUK">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/appstart/">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AppstartLtd/videos">YouTube</a> accounts are still live and it’s all there:</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure></figure></li><li><figure></figure></li><li><figure></figure></li><li><figure></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>A point of contention was that Andrew wanted them to knock out as many apps as possible, and wait to see if any of them got traction. But they wanted to choose an idea and spend a few months working on it, to do a decent job.</p>



<h2>An app a day</h2>



<p>Once I’d finished converting Skill Buy to its new format, it didn’t need any ongoing work until it had the users it needed, so I was asked to join the rest of the team building apps. We were assigned to groups of three: two developers and a designer in each. We had to make 10 apps per group every week. So each developer had to make an app a day, with the designer creating any assets we needed. We just listed off a load of crappy ideas for things that you could make without any effort. They were mostly either a multiple-choice quiz, or a button that did something silly. I was using PhoneGap to bootstrap the apps, create the icons and metadata, and just writing the app logic in PHP scripts which were hosted on the Skill Buy server. The apps looked terrible, they were pointless and had no potential. But we were hitting our targets. Andrew also fed us his own ideas, such as the “Ask an expert” series, where we’d build an app you could submit questions to, and an “expert” would respond. He seemed to think he knew some experts.</p>



<p>Around this time, the same thing that happened to Bob had happened to Alex – he just came in and shouted “I’m done, Cya!” and walked out. We knew he must have been on the receiving end of Andrew’s routine.</p>



<p>I had a similar experience with Andrew myself. One day, the web developer in the property business was off sick and I was asked to cover for him, because Andrew had been promised that some new feature was going to be ready by the end of that day. I was briefed by Steph from the property business, and I had a Google Chat open with the developer. I did what was asked, and Steph was happy with it. I was called in to present it to Andrew, who seemed to believe that this was not was he’d asked for – so he ridiculed the work, called it a waste of time, told me to “go back to apps” and proceeded to yell at Steph as I was leaving.</p>



<p>So we continued for a little while. We made our crappy apps. We hit our targets. We told our 19-year-old boss that we can’t go on like this, that none of these apps were going to succeed. I decided it was time to move on. I waited to the end of the month, made sure I’d been paid and I politely told Liam I was leaving. They had never given me a contract, so I didn’t have a notice period or anything. I just left and started looking for something new. I bumped into one of the designers a month or so later and he said that one day Andrew just closed them down and they all lost their jobs.</p>



<p>It’s a shame my first real job only lasted about 4 months, but it was a wild ride and a crazy experience. I haven’t really thought about that time much until now. Looking back, it feels so strange and the story seems so surreal, so I felt like writing about it.</p>

<h2>Andrew Camilleri, the Gazerati, and a suspended prison sentence</h2>



<p>Andrew was quite the character, but he was nothing compared to Gaz. I think Gaz was Andrew’s oldest and best friend. When Andrew made his money, he hired Gaz to be his driver / bouncer. Gaz looked like a bouncer. He was one of those people who you were terrified of at sight – but he was genuinely pleasant and nice to talk to. One day, we heard a vehicle driving around the car park making a lot of noise. Andrew had just purchased a <em>Maserati</em> as a “present” for Gaz – to drive him around in, and they were doing laps of the industrial estate. Naturally, this car became known as the <em>Gazerat</em>i.</p>



<p> While researching online for this article, I came across a news article entitled <em><a href="https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/property-developer-given-suspended-prison-sentence/">Property developer given suspended prison sentence</a></em>, which starts:</p>



<blockquote><p>Andrew John Camilleri, a businessman formerly associated with wound-up property company Fresh Start Living, has been unanimously convicted by a jury at Manchester Crown Court of making false representations in an Individual Voluntary Arrangement proposal.</p><cite>placenorthwest.co.uk</cite></blockquote>



<p>It also states that in early 2011, Andrew made false representations to creditors in attempt to wipe out debts of £9m. So rather than being a millionaire, he was actually the opposite – a negative millionaire. And it seems Fresh Start Living, like App Start Ltd, is no more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2654303675" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-real-story-of-pixar" data-authors="Alvy Ray Smith" data-headline="The Real Story of Pixar"><div><p>The story of <a href="https://www.pixar.com/" target="_blank">Pixar</a> doesn&#39;t start with its founding—a tech company&#39;s story rarely does. Rather, the original spark often comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Google" target="_blank">a university lab</a>, a renegade group at a large company, or <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/steve-wozniak-inventor-and-apple-co-founder/" target="_blank">a hobbyist building stuff for fun</a>. Pixar&#39;s story doesn&#39;t even start with the creation of Lucasfilm&#39;s Computer Graphics Group, which developed the Pixar Image Computer, the company&#39;s first product.<br/></p><p>The story, instead, goes back to a time when I and other researchers in computer graphics scattered around the United States began to see the technology as allowing a new art form: the creation of digitally animated movies. A handful of us began talking about when somebody would make the first one—&#34;The Movie,&#34; we called it—and the massive computing power it would take to pull it off. That kind of computing power was not affordable in the mid-1970s. But with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/special-report-50-years-of-moores-law" target="_self">Moore&#39;s Law</a> cranking along at a steady pace, there was every reason to think that the cost of computing power would come down sufficiently within a decade or so. In the meantime, we focused on developing the software that would make The Movie possible.</p><p>By definition, The Movie could incorporate no hand drawing. The tools to build it emerged piecemeal. First came the software that enabled computers to create two-dimensional images and, later, virtual 3D objects. Then we figured out how to move those objects, shade them, and light them before rendering them as frames of a movie.</p><p>

NYIT&#39;s owner, Alexander Schure, hired Ed Catmull, Malcolm Blanchard, and me, adding David DiFrancesco soon after. DiFrancesco and I had been using and developing software that manipulated pixels—&#34;painting&#34; pictures—at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/tech-history/silicon-revolution/behind-the-scenes-at-xerox-parcs-futures-day40-years-ago" target="_self">Xerox Parc</a>. Catmull and Blanchard had been involved with software designed to build 3D geometric objects at <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the University of Utah</a>. We four were tasked with figuring out how to incorporate computers into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traditional cel animation</a> process—a two-dimensional technique that dates back to 1915 and had changed little over the years. It took an extraordinary amount of time and talent, with teams of animators drawing and then painting individual frames by hand, and it was clear that computers could at least make it easier, if not automate many of the steps. We formed the core of a group that grew to more than a dozen over four years.</p><p>This NYIT group eventually produced a 22-minute short using the computer-assisted cel-animation technology we developed, but not until 1979. And it was still a long way from &#34;The Movie&#34;: Not only was it short, but it still involved a lot of hand drawing.</p><p>

</p><p>In 1980, we four original members of the NYIT team had been hired by <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/" target="_blank">Lucasfilm</a> to form its Computer Division. This division was charged with computerizing editing, sound design and mixing, special effects, and accounting for the company&#39;s books, as if this fourth challenge would be as difficult as the other three. Catmull, who led the Computer Division, made me head of the Computer Graphics Group, which was tasked with the special-effects project.<br/></p><p>At Lucasfilm, we continued to develop the software needed for three-dimensional computer-generated movies. And we worked on specialized hardware as well, designing a computer, called the Pixar Image Computer, that could run its calculations four times as fast as comparable general-purpose systems—but only for pixels. We were still waiting for Moore&#39;s Law to get general computers to where we needed them—it did, but this strategy gave us a boost for a few years.</p><p>We didn&#39;t get one of our fully computer-generated movie sequences into a major motion picture until 1982, with our one-minute &#34;Genesis&#34; sequence in <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>. It showed a bare planet catching on fire, melting, and then forming mountains and seas and green forests. We followed that groundbreaking piece of a movie with a brief sequence in<em> Return of the Jedi </em>in 1983, featuring a &#34;hologram&#34; of the Death Star.</p><p>While a couple of minutes is a long way from a couple of hours, we knew we had Moore&#39;s Law on our side, and were on track to make The Movie in the next few years.</p><p> But then our Computer Graphics Group, now numbering 40 people, got the news that the Computer Division was on the chopping block.</p><p>Here I&#39;ll pick up the story as adapted from my narrative in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biography-pixel" target="_blank"><em>A Biography of the Pixel</em></a>, published this month by MIT Press.</p><p><strong>George and Marcia Lucas divorced</strong> in 1983. Because California is a community-property state, George effectively lost half his fortune overnight. Over the next couple of years this resulted in the Computer Division&#39;s being split into distinct units that could be sold off, all except the Games Project, which would become Lucas Arts. By 1985, we were the last one left.</p><p>I walked into Ed Catmull&#39;s office near mine and announced, &#34;We&#39;re going to be fired, Ed. George has never really understood who we are, and he can no longer afford us. It would be a sin to let this world-class group disperse. Let&#39;s start a company to give them a home.&#34;</p><p>This was two computer nerds talking to each other. Neither of us had more than a middle manager&#39;s sense of budgets and resources, nor any detailed notion about raising money. So we bought two books each on how to start companies.</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">From left, Ed Catmull, Alvy Ray Smith, and Loren Carpenter at Lucasfilm in 1980.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."> Photo courtesy of Pixar Animation Studios</small></p><p>&#34;What will the company do?&#34; Ed asked reasonably. We both knew that the Computer Graphics Group couldn&#39;t become a separate company that depended on movies—not yet—or more importantly that it would be difficult to capitalize our company on the prospect. And our calculations convinced us that neither a software company nor a digital-effects-and-commercials house would produce revenues enough to support our group of 40 people. It had to be hardware.<br/></p><p>We did have a prototype special-purpose computer, the Pixar Image Computer. So Ed and I wrote up a business plan to build and sell Pixar Image Computers, calling them &#34;supercomputers for pixels.&#34; Within our company, we would keep a small team of computer-animation experts working for the next five years, ready to make The Movie once doing so became realistic by our calculations.</p><p>But first, we had to sell the idea of starting a company to the 38 other members of the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group. We described the plan, emphasizing that each employee would own a piece of the new company, regardless of job description.</p><p>Then Ed Catmull and I began the grind of finding funds for our new company.</p><p>Our first idea was to approach VCs. Apparently we didn&#39;t fit their idea of a seed-capital startup—and they all turned us down, 35 of them.</p><p>Then we turned our minds to making a &#34;strategic partnership&#34; with a large corporation instead. Of the 10 we talked to seriously, 8 turned us down. But we almost closed a joint deal with two vast corporations, <a href="https://www.gm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Philips</a>.</p><p>We dealt with the GM division that had formerly been a separate company, Electronic Data Systems, headed by H. Ross Perot. GM saw our technology as a way to replace their expensive clay-modeling technique for new-car designs. Philips, partnering with GM to share the financing load, was interested in our rendering technology that yielded three-dimensional internal views of human beings from CAT scans.</p><p>We signed a letter of intent with GM, Philips, and Lucasfilm, dated November 7, 1985. But that deal never happened. Three days before the signing, Perot had berated the GM board of directors about their $5-billion-plus purchase of Hughes Tools. It took a year before Perot actually left GM, but it was immediately clear, when the news broke in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, that anything happening at GM that involved Perot was now dead. Our deal fell right in that crack.<br/></p><p>GM-Philips had been our last hope. Ed and I were frantic. In the airport limo on our return trip to California, we came up with a Hail Mary—go to Steve Jobs.</p><p>This wouldn&#39;t be the first time we&#39;d talked to Jobs. Three months earlier, on August 4, Steve had invited Ed, me, and Ajit Gill, our financial manager, to his mansion in Woodside, Calif. Steve, who had just been ousted from <a href="http://apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>, proposed that he buy us from Lucasfilm and run us as his next company. We said no, that we wanted to run the company ourselves, but we would accept his money in the form of a venture investment. And he agreed.</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Steve Jobs circa 1993.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."> Kristy Macdonald/AP</small></p><p>But when Steve presented his proposal to Lucasfilm, they paid him no heed. His number was $7 to $14 million. GM and Philips were talking $20 to $36 million.<br/></p><p>Now that the GM-Philips deal had fallen through, Ed and I decided to call Steve and ask him to make the same offer again. Lucasfilm did go for it, and Steve Jobs became the venture capitalist who financed Pixar.</p><p>

</p><p>Note that Jobs did not <em>buy</em> Pixar. He financed a spinout corporation that was partially owned by the employees; Steve took 70 percent and the employees had 30 percent. Steve capitalized the company with $10 million. We took the first check from him at the signing for $5 million, and Ed immediately endorsed it over to Lucasfilm. That bought us the rights to the technology we had developed there, including the Pixar Image Computer.</p><p>Pixar the company was officially born on February 3, 1986, in San Rafael, north of San Francisco. We had managed to keep the team together. And we thought we had an exciting product in the Pixar Image Computer.</p><p><span></span>Meanwhile, Steve had started running a different computer company, NeXT, about an hour and a half away, south of San Francisco. That physical separation turned out to be a godsend.</p><p>We kept the possibility of The Movie alive during the next five years with a series of short films, including <em>Luxo Jr</em>. (1986), nominated for an Academy Award; <em>Tin Toy </em>(1988)<em> </em>winner of an Academy Award; <em>Red&#39;s Dream</em> (1987); and <em>Knick Knack</em> (1989). These were four of the sparkling jewels that sustained us during these otherwise tough years.</p><p>Each one of these pieces represented continued improvements in the underlying in-house technologies. <em>Luxo Jr.</em>, for example, incorporated the first articulated objects that self-shadowed themselves from multiple light sources. <em>Red&#39;s Dream</em> showed off our Pixar Image Computer: the principal background for the piece, a bicycle shop, was the most complex computer graphics scene ever rendered at the time.</p><p>The fifth jewel was CAPS, the Computer Animation Production System we created for <a href="https://www.disney.com/" target="_blank">Disney</a>, building on our experience working on cel-animation tools at NYIT. It kept Pixar and Disney close in a mutually admiring relationship and was a major source of income for the fledgling Pixar. Every Disney cel animation for years following was executed on the system for a total of 18 feature films. It used Pixar Image Computers running animation software written by Pixar people and logistics software, used for keeping track of the complicated production process, written by Disney people. Disney first used CAPS for one scene in <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, released in 1989, and by 1990 produced an entire movie using the system, <em>The Rescuers Down Under</em>.</p><p>Pixar&#39;s sixth and crowning jewel during the pre-Movie years was <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/and-the-oscar-goes-to" target="_self">RenderMan</a>, a groundbreaking piece of software that became an industry standard.</p><p>The path to RenderMan began with individual shading techniques, such as Gouraud shading or Phong shading, both from the 1970s at the University of Utah. Then, in the early 1980s, during our time at Lucasfilm, Rob Cook generalized the notion into a comprehensive shading language that acted as a front end to Lucasfilm&#39;s internal rendering solution, a system that ran on our specialized hardware.</p><p>The next big leap was to free the shading language from the specificity of Lucasfilm&#39;s hardware, making a specific language into a <em>standard</em> language. This was huge. It created a unified computer-graphics industry and gave RenderMan a place in history.</p><p>RenderMan freed a picture maker from having to know the specifics of any one company&#39;s rendering hardware. When you buy RenderMan, you get its shading language, a compiler for that language, and a complete rendering system for any hardware that supports the language. A moviemaker, say, has only to know RenderMan&#39;s shading language, and the RenderMan system takes care of the rest—the generation of the pixels—behind the scenes.</p><p>Creating a good standard is hard—it must be very well designed in order to work universally and to hold up over time. RenderMan, published in 1990, has become a Hollywood staple for visual effects and animation.</p><p>But Pixar, at that point, was still a hardware company. And Pixar was a lousy hardware company. We failed several times over our first five years. That&#39;s failure measured the usual way: We ran out of money and couldn&#39;t pay our bills or our employees.</p><p>If we&#39;d had any other investor than Steve, we would have been dead in the water. But at every failure—presumably because Steve couldn&#39;t sustain the embarrassment that his next enterprise after the Apple ouster would be a failure—he&#39;d berate those of us in management . . . then write another check. And each check effectively reduced employee equity. After several such &#34;refinancings,&#34; he had poured about $50 million (half of the fortune he had made from Apple) into Pixar. In today&#39;s money, that&#39;s more than $100 million. On March 6, 1991, in Pixar&#39;s fifth year, he finally <em>did</em> buy the company from the employees outright.</p><p>But Pixar was still in serious financial trouble. We tried all sorts of ways to make money, like a television-commercial production business, but none of these efforts had enough income-producing capacity to even hope to pay for our company&#39;s operating expenses. Jobs explored the notion of folding us into NeXT, but his cofounders there wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>Then, at last, Moore&#39;s Law saved us. The ever-falling cost of processing power finally made The Movie economically feasible. We said we could make The Movie, and Disney stepped forward to finance it, saving Steve Jobs&#39;s face (and investment) and saving Pixar the company. Ed Catmull closed the movie deal with Disney in July 1991.</p><p>The Movie was not Steve Jobs&#39;s idea; he never talked about movies. He was a hardware man. The Movie had been our dream and goal since the 1970s.</p><p>But I had to leave. I had to get Steve Jobs out of my life. About a year earlier he had attacked me in full bullying, tyrannical mode in what is infamously known as &#34;the whiteboard incident&#34; and described in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J3IEZQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>During the next four years, Pixar completed The Movie—<em>Toy Story</em>—and it premiered in 1995. <em>Toy Story</em> was wildly successful almost as soon as the movie was in the can. Pixar and Disney took it to New York City for a first glimpse by critics, and their enthusiasm was electric.</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Bill Reeves at Pixar working on Toy Story.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."> Michael Ansell/Photo courtesy of Pixar Animation Studios</small></p><p>Pixar at the time had little cash except what it had from selling off bits and pieces of the failing hardware part of the company, and a few other small deals. Yet Jobs took Pixar public on November 29, 1995, on nothing more than the promise of <em>Toy Story</em>. It salvaged his reputation and made him a billionaire.</p><p>Pixar&#39;s public offering, set the company&#39;s value at 151.8 million, at an opening price of $22; the stock closed that first day at $39. It was the biggest IPO of the year. Disney bought the company in 2006 for more than $7 billion. This is astounding considering they could have had us for free in the 1970s when we approached them on bended knee. Or they could have had us for $10 million in the mid-1980s when Jobs was our last-chance, Hail Mary investor, or for $50 million in the late 1980s when he would have sold us to anyone to make himself whole and unembarrassed.<br/></p><p>By the turn of the millennium or thereabouts, Pixar produced three other successful digital movies: <em>A Bug&#39;s Life</em> (1998), <em>Toy Story 2</em> (1999), and <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> (2001). As of this writing, Pixar made The Movie 24 times.</p></div>

Plimpton 322 set him on a quest to find other tablets from the same period that contained Pythagorean triples, eventually leading him to Si.427.</p><p>“Si.427 is about a piece of land that’s being sold,” Mansfield said. In the cuneiform script, with its characteristic wedge-shaped indentations, the tablet describes a field containing marshy areas, as well as a threshing floor and nearby tower.</p><p>The rectangles depicting the field have opposite sides of equal length, suggesting surveyors of that time period had devised a way to create perpendicular lines more accurately than before, according to Mansfield.</p><p>“Much like we would today, you’ve got private individuals trying to figure out where their land boundaries are, and the surveyor comes out but instead of using a piece of GPS equipment, they use Pythagorean triples.”</p><p>Though Plimpton 322 and Si.427 both use Pythagorean triples, they predate the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/11/the-10-best-mathematicians" data-link-name="in body link">Greek mathematician Pythagoras</a> by more than 1,000 years.</p><p>“Once you understand what Pythagorean triples are, your society has reached a particular level of mathematical sophistication,” Mansfield said.</p><p>Si.427 contains three Pythagorean triples: 3, 4, 5; 8, 15, 17; and 5, 12, 13.</p><figure id="1a890300-7c14-4448-ae70-3f4605e01af4"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-14 | 14" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></figure><p>The Babylonians used a base 60 number system – similar to how we keep time today – which made working with prime numbers larger than five difficult.</p><p>Si.427, described in a study in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10699-021-09806-0" data-link-name="in body link">Foundations of Science</a>, dates from a period of increasing private land ownership. “Now that we know what problem the Babylonians were solving, that recolours all the mathematical tablets from this period,” Mansfield said. “You see mathematics being developed to address the needs of the time.”</p><p>One thing that puzzles Mansfield about Si.427 is the sexagesimal number “25:29” – similar to 25 minutes and 29 seconds – that is etched in large font on the back of the tablet.</p><p>“Is it part of a calculation that they performed? Is it an area that I haven’t come across yet? Is it a measurement of something?” he said. “It’s really annoying to me because there’s so much about the tablet that I understand. I’ve given up trying to figure out what that one is.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.</p><div>
            <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Since many of us are working from home in these trying times, it seems safe to assume that more people than ever are indulging in playing the occasional computer game. A city builder is a specific kind of computer game in which you design a city, extract resources, set up production chains and ensure that your settlement grows. City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.</p><h3><strong>Historical city builders</strong></h3><p>The city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the management genre, leading to games such as <em>Sim City</em> (1989), <em>Caesar </em>(1992) and <em>Age of Empires</em> (1997).</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">

                  <p>It did not take long before medieval-themed city builders popped up. We may think of <em>Settlers</em> (1993) and <em>Knights and Merchants</em> (1998). In addition, the <em>Anno</em> games (1998-2019), although initially set in the 1600s basically had a medieval theme.</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">

							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>These games often start with plopping down a village center on a promising location near abundant resources. You then continue to gather these resources which grant you building materials for building new homes and facilities for your settlement.</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">
									
												   <figcaption>Screenshot: Settlers (1993)</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>Setting up specialized production chains might involve growing grain, milling the grain for flour and turning the flour into bread which feeds your villages. Similarly, another production chain might involve rearing sheep for their wool, turning the wool into cloth and turning the cloth into clothing. When done correctly, the reward of correct investments and planning is that you see your settlement grow.</p>

							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>This often leads to settlements growing organically from a couple of houses around a community center to a larger settlement with hundreds of people. However logical such an organic growth of a settlement might seem, it is not historically accurate.</p>

                  <p>A thing that is rarely touched upon in medieval city builders is how complex village life actually was. This can be exemplified by how the community related to its overlords. Land ownership here is key. Land in the community might be owned by a lord, a local liegeman, a monastery or even directly by the duke or count. Taxes, rents and tithes were the organisational structures in which the landowner was tied to the farmers who worked the fields. Often the payment of taxes and tithes was linked to feast days and the visit of the tax collector represented a big event in the agricultural year. An interesting side note is that some obligations which the commoners had to the lord and the church (such as seigneurial duties like working a mill) might drain the community from the needed manpower for tilling the land. Furthermore, a rural community that was its own seigneury had access to a law court with sheriff, aldermen and a local militia (Middle Dutch <em>schutterie</em>) to fight off bandits with. Harsh capital punishments were set in place to deter anyone from raiding the farms and hamlets and the village gallows were often the first thing one saw when approaching a medieval settlement. </p><h3><strong>Planning a medieval settlement</strong></h3><p>But something that is much more fundamental to the theme of a settlement building game, is how medieval settlements were actually planned and grew. Landscape historians and archaeologists have acquired a lot of insight into how this worked.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the realization that medieval settlements in their first stages of development were planned and laid out according to a specific design. In my own research into the settlement history of West-Brabant (southern Netherlands, from 1000 to 1300 CE) I have encountered the following types.</p><p>Here is a sketch of a Brabantine circular manor (Middle Dutch <em>vroonhoeve</em>). This is a reinforced circular homestead with moat, often next to a bend in the river, containing several farms and a fan-like plot pattern radiating out from it. Such manors were often called BORCH.</p>

					</a>
												   <figcaption>Sketch of a Brabantine street settlement</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>Here is a sketch of a Brabantine street settlement, often built with exploitation of nearby fenland in mind. It consists of a line of farms with associated evenly sized rectangular plots built in a line perpendicular to a raised road.</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">

					<a href="#8238" id="PAK Game Blog8">
						
					</a>
												   <figcaption>Sketch of a more complex exploitation village</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>Here is a more complex exploitation village which is set up with a moated enclosed church homestead and a central meadow as its center. There is a line of farms next to the road. The arable land to the east is bordered by a ditch supplying fresh drinking water (Middle Dutch <em>bansloot</em>). In layout, this type represents a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types. </p>

					</a>
												   <figcaption>Sketch of a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>Let us first make clear that these different types of exploitation settlements often existed alongside each other and can be found in one and the same region. In part, the different types reflect different chronological layers but some types were also more suited to certain geographical environments than others.</p><p>So how were these settlements planned? Many medieval exploitation enterprises were initiated by a monastery or a consortium of free men who were granted permission by (or bought permission from) the feudal lord to “colonize” the wilderness.</p><p>Clearing the wooded landscape in order to create arable land was done by cutting away the trees and bushes (Middle Dutch <em>rode</em>) or, alternatively, burning it away in controlled fires (Middle Dutch <em>brant</em>).</p><p>Land surveyors sent by the lord would then measure out the block or strips that would be taken in cultivation. Strips of arable land were often 1250m deep (6 Middle Dutch <em>voorlingen </em>= <em>furlongs</em>) so that the plough could go straight in a long line before having to turn. Important blocks or strips were demarcated by hedges, earthwork, woodwork, ditches or roads. Medieval names for these blocks often survived into the modern day. </p><p>The presence of drinking water (a river or a brook) in the vicinity was an important factor in choosing the location for the settlement. The vicinity of water entailed risk and reward because flooding was an ever present danger. Floods could devastate arable land but might also fertilize it. Meadows in particular were often situated in flood areas. </p><h3><strong>Managing a settlement</strong></h3><p>So how was such a settlement managed? First of all, the quality of the soil had to be carefully controlled by crop rotation: specific crops were sown on different segments of the arable land with one part laying fallow to recover from the tilling (English three-field system, Dutch <em>drieslagstelsel</em>). The cattle and sheep were put out to pasture on the common meadows guarded by a shepherd or cowherd. Pigs were allowed to forage in the nearby forests and killed in autumn before the winter starvation set in.</p><p>Roads and rivers were important for transport of crops and livestock. These roads, some of them paved, some of them not, needed to be maintained. They were essential to the payment of the tithe, since tithe collectors assessed the harvest on the field and later collected the sheaves on the side of the road.</p><p>The buildings within the community also needed maintenance. Farmhouses, community barns and stables were made of wood and had to be rebuilt every few generations, only the name of the farm or homestead being continued.</p><p>So what kind of threats did a medieval settlement face? First of all, the weather was an important factor which dictated the success of the harvest. Storms, droughts and floods could devastate the harvest and decimate the community.</p><p>Diseases and epidemics were another danger threatening the community. The situation on the countryside was a lot better in this regard than in the medieval towns, but an epidemic could still mean the end of a village. Similarly, diseases among livestock impacted the medieval subsistence economy in a brutal way.</p><p>Then there are the consequences of medieval warfare affecting the community: Armies that passed by could plunder the village, burn the farms and execute villagers at will. Or they could also demand supplies, food and provisions as an emergency &#34;tax&#34;<br/></p>
                        						<figure id="10615">
									
												   <figcaption>Screenshot: Burning village in Knights and Merchants (1998)</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>But war also brought indirect consequences; a liege lord calling the banners and levying troops from the village community might extract a large part of the adult men. Warfare also disrupted the trade networks that supplied a village with building materials and commodities.</p><p>Then there were internal threats to the fabric of the village community. We may think of social unrest because of land disputes. Feuds could also tear a community apart with endemic vendetta’s causing death and despair. A socially unstable society was also more prone to internal accusations of heresy and witchcraft.</p><h3><strong>An “accurate” medieval settlement builder</strong></h3><p>So, which of the above listed features could potentially contribute to a more historically accurate computer game about medieval settlement building? First of all, it would be more realistic if the settlement could first be planned out and was not forced to &#34;grow organically&#34; from a community center. The first settlement phase would be a test of how “successful” a layout is in adapting to the exigencies of the terrain and the needs of the community. Only after that initial layout proved successful, further expansions can be planned. </p><p>Secondly, it would be more realistic if we could build both straight roads and curved roads, just as in <em>Cities Skylines </em>(2015), a modern city builder well known for its incredibly flexible layout tools. Incidentally, the tools of Cities Skylines can also be used to recreate medieval settlements, as was done by YouTube creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7wsXzeuaqk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Curiously</a> who constructed an impression of a medieval Croatian village.</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">
									
												   <figcaption>Screenshot: Cities Skylines (2015) by YouTuber Play Curiously</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>Such a flexible road drawing tool can then also be used to lay out ditches, hedges and enclosures since these features were central to the medieval experience of the cultivated landscape.</p><p>Thirdly, It would be interesting to see a medieval-themed game embrace the concept of flood valleys that limit and endanger pasture and arable land. Other historical city builders such as <em>Pharaoh</em> (1999) and <em>Children of the Nile</em> (2004) already implemented this feature for their setting in Ancient Egypt. However, such a mechanic would likewise fit a medieval city builder and show the general public how medieval society dealt with seasonal flooding as well as the devastating effects that storm floods could have.</p>
                        						<figure id="10615">
									
												   <figcaption>Screenshot:  Children of the Nile (2004)</figcaption>
							</figure>
	   						
                  <p>And finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.</p><h3><strong>Why not?</strong></h3><p>There are some good reasons why city building games are not that historically accurate and instead adhere to the established formula of the city building game. </p><p>First of all, a linear growth model makes sense from a gameplay perspective, since it is rewarding to see your settlement grow.in a linear way. It fosters a feeling of progress and motivates the player to keep momentum and push through to the next expansion phase. Secondly, games are generally wary of punishing failure too harshly in order to avoid demoralizing the player. Thirdly, in order to facilitate path finding for the simulated villagers it is easier to implement a gridlike road and building system rather than an off-grid building system that allows for curvy roads. So far only <em>Cities Skylines </em>has managed to do this in a satisfactory way. </p><p>Lastly, for marketing purposes and recognizability, game developers generally don&#39;t stray too far from the image of the Middle Ages that the public is already acquainted with. For a medieval city builder this means windmills, industrious peasants, lots of sheep and stone castles. Things like land surveying, crop rotation and tithe collection do not fit this image and challenge the romanticized picture of the uneducated farmer in his pre-industrial environment. </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Although I think medieval-themed city building games could benefit from incorporating some of the things we know about medieval settlement history into the gameplay loop, it may not be desirable for game developers to stray too far from the established formula. The idea that medieval settlements developed organically according to messy road plans is strongly imbedded in popular perception. Allowing both straight and curved road building in medieval city builders, may serve to challenge some of the stereotypes that exist about medieval village life. And if you ask me, that would be a good thing for it is an enriching experience to see the world through the eyes of our medieval forebears. One may find out that their lives were not that different after all... </p><h3><strong>Further reading</strong></h3><ul><li>Fossier, R. (2004). “The Rural Economy and Demographic Growth.” In: D.

<p>New York City is mandating proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter certain indoor businesses — including all indoor restaurants, entertainment venues and gyms, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday.</p>



<p>“It’s time for people to see vaccination as necessary to living a good and full and healthy life,” de Blasio said during his daily press briefing.</p>



<p>“This is crucial, because we know that this will encourage a lot more vaccination.”</p>



<p>The program, which de Blasio dubbed the “Key to NYC Pass,” makes New York the first major US city to create such a mandate, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/02/de-blasio-requiring-all-newly-hired-nyc-employees-be-vaccinated/">marks a significant escalation</a> of the city’s efforts to curb the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant. The initiative will launch on Aug. 16, the mayor said.</p>



<p>“It will require vaccination for workers and customers in indoor dining, in indoor fitness facilities, indoor entertainment facilities,” he said from City Hall. “The only way to patronize these businesses indoors is if you’re vaccinated.”</p>



<p>“If you want to participate in society fully, you’ve got to get vaccinated,” de Blasio added.</p>



<p>Enforcement will begin on Sept. 13, following a public service announcement campaign, de Blasio said. Entry will be denied to anyone without a shot.</p>



<p>“If we’re going to stop the Delta variant, the time is now,” said the mayor. “This is going to make clear, you want to enjoy everything great in this summer of New York City? Go get vaccinated.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>The “Key to NYC Pass” is part of the city’s initiative to curb the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.</figcaption><figcaption><span>Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The program is modeled after the vaccine passport programs rolled out in France and other European countries, officials said.</p>



<p>De Blasio said City Hall is finalizing the regulations, including if children younger than 12 years old with vaccinated parents will be allowed to dine indoors.  Additionally, the mayor said the city is examining expanding the vaccine proof requirement to other indoor activities, such as shopping.</p>



<p>The specifics of the new policy will be finalized by the week of Aug. 16, de Blasio said.</p>



<p>New Yorkers will be required to show either the state’ “Excelsior Pass,” the city’s new vaccine pass or Center for Disease Control’s paper vaccine card, as proof of vaccination, according to the mayor.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Excelsior Pass app provides digital proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative test results.</figcaption><figcaption><span>SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the newly released<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/nyc-expanding-covid-vaccine-or-test-mandate-to-all-city-workers/"> rules for city workers</a>, those who are unvaccinated will not have an option to receive a COVID-19 test, de Blasio said. The restrictions will not apply to outdoor dining.</p>



<p>State Sen. James Sanders Jr. (D-Queens) said he supports the policy.</p>



<p>“Only government can make a difference here,” he said during the virtual press briefing. “If we do not take a strong stand and say ‘you have the right to your body, of course; but you do not have to kill other people.”</p>



<p>“A strong stance needs to be taken,” the lawmaker added. “It will be controversial, but your stance — when we look back in history on this one, this will be a defining moment in your government.”</p>



<p>Tren’ness Woods-Black — granddaughter of Sylvia Woods, founder of the later Sylvia’s in Harlem — said the vaccine requirement is a necessary measure to keep neighborhood residents who have not yet received a shot healthy. </p>



<figure><figcaption>“If you’re vaccinated, a world of opportunity opens up to you,” Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed.</figcaption><figcaption><span>Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The real case is that COVID is killing us,” she said. “We are being hit — especially in Harlem and other black and brown communities especially hard — because lots of folks are not getting the vaccination.”</p>



<p>The major announcement comes after de Blasio has in recent days repeatedly floated the possibility of ramping up restrictions and vaccine requirements. He <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/20/de-blasio-to-mandate-covid-vaccinations-for-public-hospitals-staff-sources/">mandated</a> in late July that all public health system employees get their shots or receive a weekly coronavirus test — and then<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/nyc-expanding-covid-vaccine-or-test-mandate-to-all-city-workers/"> expanded the requirement</a> to the entire city workforce.</p>



<p>“We’ve got to shake people at this point and say, ‘Come on now.’ We tried voluntary. We could not have been more kind and compassionate. Free testing, everywhere you turn, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/14/nyc-hits-new-covid-19-low-positivity-rate/">incentives</a>, friendly, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/25/people-who-get-vaccinated-at-msg-can-win-knicks-tickets/">warm embrace</a>. The voluntary phase is over,” de Blasio <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/27/de-blasio-proclaims-voluntary-phase-is-over-on-covid-vaccines/">said on MSNBC</a> last week. “It’s time for mandates, because it’s the only way to protect our people.”</p>



<p>During <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/30/nyc-may-impose-vaccine-mandate-on-bars-eateries-de-blasio/">an appearance on CNN</a>, the mayor left the door open to soon imposing vaccination requirements to enter city bars and restaurants.</p>



<p>“Given everything we’re learning, all options are on the table,” he said Friday. “I keep saying we’re climbing the ladder in terms of more and more mandates.”</p>

<p>And on Monday, the mayor hinted at the Big Apple moving toward a “reality” in which those who do not get vaccinated are barred from certain settings.</p>



<p>“More and more, there’s going to be a reality where, if you’re vaccinated, a world of opportunity opens up to you. If you’re not vaccinated, there’s going to be more and more things you can’t do,” de Blasio said during his virtual press briefing, when he announced that the city will only hire vaccinated workers and advised all New Yorkers to wear masks in indoor, public settings.</p>



<p>“I say that to say, go get vaccinated, so you can fully participate in the life of this city, because that’s where things are going.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <date>2 August 2021</date>
        
        
<p><em>The title is a reference to the mostly forgotten nickname of the excellent <a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a> —</em> <em>Cheese Shop — which refers to the Monty Python <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz1JWzyvv8A">Cheese Shop sketch</a>.</em></p>



<p>I often find myself staring at the piwheels monitor, and occasionally a strange package name or an unusually longer version number pops up:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>I’ve been doing a lot of auditing piwheels vs PyPI lately, making sure we have the right set of packages and versions, pruning stuff that should have been deleted and adding in any that somehow got missed. And I came across lots of interesting oddities, so I thought I’d do some analysis and exploration and share the results here.</p>



<p>The following analysis is of a set of packages and version obtained from PyPI a few days ago, and at the time there were:</p>



<ul><li><strong>311,063 packages</strong></li><li><strong>2,766,603 versions</strong></li></ul>



<h2>Longest package names</h2>



<p>The most common length of package name is <strong>8</strong> characters (like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gpiozero/"><strong>gpiozero</strong></a>):</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>The least common package name lengths are <strong>72</strong>, <strong>73</strong>, <strong>74</strong>, <strong>75</strong>, <strong>80</strong>, <strong>82</strong>, <strong>83</strong>, <strong>90</strong>, <strong>92</strong> — all of which occur once.</p>



<p>The longest package names are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest/"><strong>testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest</strong></a> (92)</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wix-protos-com.wix.ecom.shipments.localdelivery-wix-ecommerce-shipments-local-delivery-web/"><strong>wix-protos-com-wix-ecom-shipments-localdelivery-wix-ecommerce-shipments-local-delivery-web</strong></a> (90)</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wix-protos-multilingual-localizationimporterexporter-localization-importer-exporter/"><strong>wix-protos-multilingual-localizationimporterexporter-localization-importer-exporter</strong></a> (83)</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wix-protos-ecom-shipments-localdelivery-wix-ecommerce-shipments-local-delivery-web/"><strong>wix-protos-ecom-shipments-localdelivery-wix-ecommerce-shipments-local-delivery-web</strong></a> (82)</li></ul>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<h2>Starting characters</h2>



<p>The most common starting character for a package name is <strong>p</strong> (14%), due to lots of packages being named “py”-something or “python”-something. Second is <strong>d</strong> (9%) due to “django-” packages. The distribution for the rest of the character set is:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>The least common starting character is <strong>9</strong>. Only five packages start with a 9:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/91act-platform">91act-platform</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/99d4aa80-d846-424f-873b-a02c7215fc54">99d4aa80-d846-424f-873b-a02c7215fc54</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/908dist">908dist</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/91downloader">91downloader</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/9">9</a></strong></li></ul>



<p>Looking at the first two characters, the most common are <strong>py</strong>, <strong>dj</strong>, <strong>od</strong>, <strong>co</strong> and <strong>re</strong>:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>Looking at the first three characters, <strong>dja</strong> takes over <strong>py</strong>:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<h2>Benford’s Law</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford’s Law</a> states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small, and hence the distribution of each subsequent digit is less likely. I wondered if this could be seen within package version numbers. Taking the numeric versions, and looking at the first non-zero digit, the distribution is reasonably compliant with Benford’s Law:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>However, looking at the distribution of all digits (not just the first), this follows the pattern laid out by Benford’s Law much more closely:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>In both cases, 1 is more common that expected, 2 seems to be perfectly aligned, but 9 is slightly more common than expected, more so in the first digit example.</p>



<h2>Number of versions per package</h2>



<p>I excluded packages which had no versions (because they don’t have JSON endpoints on PyPI). As for the rest of them, over a quarter only have a single version. The frequency drops steadily as the number of versions rises:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>The package with the most versions is <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pulumi/">pulumi</a></strong> with <strong>2,566</strong> versions!</p>



<h2>Version length</h2>



<p>A PyPI package version doesn’t have to be strictly numeric – they’re usually in the form 1.2.3 or similar, sometimes with characters appended to indicate alpha, beta, dev or release candidate, but they can be <em>any</em> string.</p>



<ul><li>The most common version length is <strong>5</strong>, which matches the “<strong>1.2.3</strong>” format.</li><li>The single most common version is “<strong>0.1.0</strong>” which occurs <strong>57,258</strong> times</li><li>There are <strong>233,734</strong> distinct versions</li><li>The longest version is a version of package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lyricsprocessor"><strong>lyricsprocessor</strong></a>, with the version number <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lyricsprocessor/0.1.40404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040/"><strong>0.1.40404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040</strong></a> (84 chars)</li><li>The next longest are all from package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/softwarefabrica.django.utils/"><strong>softwarefabrica-django-utils</strong></a> which exclusively has versions of 70 characters e.g. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/softwarefabrica.django.utils/1.0dev-BZR-r115-panta-elasticworld.org-20100520155735-sf3yrsr0pvyvlm8m/"><strong>1.0dev-BZR-r115-panta-elasticworld.org-20100520155735-sf3yrsr0pvyvlm8m</strong></a></li></ul>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>At one point in PyPI’s history, someone accidentally submitted the description of their package as the version name, so there was a version of package <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/sysv-ipc/">sysv-ipc</a></strong> called:</p>



<pre>Sysv_ipc gives Python programs access to System V semaphores, shared memory and message queues. Most (all?) Unixes (including OS X) support System V IPC. Windows+Cygwin 1.7 might also work. 

Sample code is included.

This extension is released under the GPL. 

You might also be interested in the similar POSIX IPC module at: http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/</pre>



<p>Yes, that entire block of text. The version has now been deleted.</p>



<div><figure><figcaption>The truncated version number appearing on piwheels, prior to its deletion</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Other times this kind of thing has happened by accident include the first version of <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/omnijson/">omnijson</a></strong> which was called “<strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/omnijson/Kenneth%20Reitz/">Kenneth Reitz</a></strong>” and is still live:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<h2>Whitespace significance?</h2>



<p>I recently noticed a version which seemed to have whitespace at the end of it, and had a look to see if there were others. There are 16 versions on PyPI which end in a newline character. Of these 16, 12 have registered the stripped equivalent too:</p>



<ul><li><strong>bugzilla</strong> ‘1.0\n’</li><li><strong>bugzilla</strong> ‘1.0.0\n’</li><li><strong>django-filtered-form</strong> ‘1.0.1\n’</li><li><strong>django-mongokit</strong> ‘0.2.3\n’</li><li><strong>docbook</strong> ‘1.0.11\n’</li><li><strong>git-plus</strong> ‘0.2.1.beta\n’</li><li><strong>lcinvestor</strong> ‘2.2.1\n’</li><li><strong>lendingclub</strong> ‘0.1.7\n’</li><li><strong>pythonwpy</strong> ‘0.3.0\n’</li><li><strong>pythonwpy</strong> ‘0.3.3\n’</li><li><strong>rabbit-qurator</strong> ‘v1.0.0\n’</li><li><strong>rtmidi2</strong> ‘0.5.2\n’</li></ul>



<p>Visually, on PyPI, these look identical:</p>







<h2>Non-numeric version names</h2>



<p>Since version numbers tend to be numeric, surely the most interesting ones are those without any numbers in them.</p>



<ul><li>There are <strong>166</strong> packages which have non-numeric versions</li><li>There are a total of <strong>171</strong> non-numeric versions</li><li>The longest non-numeric version is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jw.util/"><strong>jw-util</strong></a> version “<strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/jw.util/-class.-jw.util.version.Version-/">-class.-jw.util.version.Version-</a></strong>“</li></ul>



<p>This version number of <strong>jw-util</strong> seems to have been another accident:</p>



<div><figure></figure></div>



<p>Since the version included a tarball in its <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jw.util/-class.-jw.util.version.Version-/#files">release</a>, you can inspect how this accident occurred. Lots of complicated code for calculating what the version number should be … gone wrong. The version string is actually the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr">repr</a> of the Version class, not the string representation of the instance, as intended. Normally it would appear as <code>&lt;__class__.jw.util.version.Version&gt;</code> but it’s been canonicalised, replacing the angle brackets and double underscores with single hyphens.</p>



<p>Interestingly (if you’ve made it this far, I think you’re the kind of person who’ll find this interesting), of the 166 packages with non-numeric versions, all but five of them have only a single non-numeric version, and those five only have two such versions each. Those are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/confine-controller"><strong>confine-controller</strong></a> ‘dev’ and ‘beta’</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycli"><strong>pycli</strong></a> ‘devel’ and ‘dev’</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyircserver"><strong>pyircserver</strong></a> ‘PreAlpha’ and ‘Alpha’</li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/amoi">amoi</a></strong> ‘lol’ and ‘.lol.’</li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/dstufft-testpkg">dstufft-testpkg</a></strong> ‘dog’ and ‘watwatwat’</li></ul>



<h2>Queen’s English</h2>



<p>Using the system dictionaries, I wondered how many package names were dictionary words:</p>



<ul><li><strong>11,131</strong> packages are a single word found in the US English dictionary</li><li><strong>11,031</strong> packages are are a single word found in the British English dictionary</li><li>Only <strong>39</strong> of the British English dictionary packages do not appear in the US dictionary, so for fun, let’s see what those are:<ul><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/acclimatise">acclimatise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/aluminium">aluminium</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/analyse">analyse</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/armoury">armoury</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/behaviour">behaviour</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/caesium">caesium</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/colour">colour</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/colouration">colouration</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/coloured">coloured</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/colourful">colourful</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/colourless">colourless</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/colours">colours</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/connexion">connexion</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/decentralise">decentralise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/draughts">draughts</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/draughtsman">draughtsman</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/fibre">fibre</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/gramme">gramme</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/harbour">harbour</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/inflexion">inflexion</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/labours">labours</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/liquorice">liquorice</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/memorised">memorised</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mitre">mitre</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/motorise">motorise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mould">mould</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/moult">moult</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mums">mums</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/normalise">normalise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/optimisation">optimisation</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/optimise">optimise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/optimiser">optimiser</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/organise">organise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyjamas">pyjamas</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/sceptre">sceptre</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/spectre">spectre</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/spectres">spectres</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/summarise">summarise</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/tricolour">tricolour</a></strong></li></ul></li></ul>

      <title>Launch HN: Keyri (YC S21) – Secure smartphone-based passwordless authentication</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28063339</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, we&#39;re Zain and Grant at Keyri. We make a white label passwordless authentication SDK that companies can embed into their mobile apps for instant biometrics-based registration and login on any device. Keyri can be used for (1) authentication by itself, (2) an auth option in addition to passwords and OpenID, (3) step-up identity verification in high risk-score scenarios.<p>Passwords suck - they&#39;re terrible for security and terrible for ease of use. 2FA solutions are clunky and still insecure - for example, SMS-based 2FA doesn&#39;t work when you travel abroad, and it can be defeated with phishing and SIM swapping. They also allow users to share their subscription accounts with others, robbing companies of revenue. Password-based auth also enables the sort of bot activity that renders sites like Ticketmaster and StockX unusable for real customers.</p><p>2FA methods currently in the market represent a tradeoff between security and ease of use. Secure 2FA methods like USB keys are a pain to use, while easy 2FA methods like SMS passcodes are unsecure. Keyri essentially takes the USB key concept and puts it in users&#39; phones. This is hard to do in a secure way while maintaining a seamless UX due to the need for two-way communication to prevent phishing. Some enterprise-focused smartphone-based passwordless solutions require a Bluetooth or WiFi connection between users’ phones and their other devices to ensure security, which is obviously untenable for rollout to mass audiences. Our system works securely 100% over HTTPS and computer vision (beyond just reading QR codes). An additional difficulty is that companies don&#39;t want to force their users to download a third-party app. We solve this with our SDK that allows companies to bake our passwordless auth capability into their apps.</p><p>Keyri replaces passwords with public key cryptography plus biometrics. Instead of remembering and typing in your credentials, authentication happens by just scanning a QR code (on desktop web) or tapping a button (on mobile web and mobile native apps). Thanks to biometrics and cryptographic functions happening in the background, multi-factor authentication happens in one step that takes less than a second.</p><p>At registration, the Keyri SDK generates a key pair, stores the private key in the phone&#39;s secure enclave, and sends the public key to the relying party&#39;s (our customer’s) credential server. At login, the SDK first verifies the user&#39;s identity via biometrics (Face ID etc.), then generates a signed authentication request using the stored private key, then sends that request to the relying party&#39;s auth server, which authenticates the user by verifying the signature using the public key it received during registration. The user&#39;s private keys never leave their phone. There&#39;s a lot more cryptography, handshakes, secret sauce, etc. that happen during the auth flow, but those are incidental to the core concept outlined above.</p><p>What&#39;s different about us? 1. Keyri is available as a mobile SDK, allowing any company to offer passwordless onboarding and WhatsApp-like QR code login entirely within their own app without a long and tricky dev cycle. 2. Keyri doesn&#39;t require any typing or setup / opt in. Other passwordless solutions require typing out a username/email address and/or connecting by bluetooth, specialized onboarding, etc. 3. Key backup and recovery is handled automatically via the cloud (iCloud / Google Drive). Additional backup/restore options are available in our SDK. 4. Privacy: unlike OpenID and some other passwordless solutions, Keyri’s server does not store or see any private keys or any personal information. Our API simply facilitates the transmission of public keys and encrypted signed authentication requests.</p><p>We charge companies based on how many unique users use Keyri to log in to their web services in a given month. We can provide our API in a self-hostable format for companies in heavily regulated industries. Our auth endpoint code is open source, but our API and mobile SDK are not.</p><p>If you want to try the experience, check out our live demo here: <a href="https://keyri.co/demo" rel="nofollow">https://keyri.co/demo</a>. Note that this demo uses our standalone authenticator app, which is available for companies that don’t have their own mobile app, but our main product is the white label SDK that incorporates the authenticator app’s full functionality (and then some) into our customers’ apps.</p><p>As a long-time HN lurker, I know the community has expertise and strong opinions on authentication. It would be great to get your feedback, and I’d be happy to answer any questions. We’re very actively building out the system, so any ideas for bolstering our system are welcome.</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> has banned a group of academics from New York University who researched <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-political-ads-global-witness-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political ads</a> and misinformation on the platform. </p>



<p>The social media giant announced in a blog post on Wednesday that it had banned the accounts, apps, and pages related to the <a href="https://adobservatory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYU Ad Observatory</a>, a project by <a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybersecurity of Democracy</a>. The ban is the latest in a long-running feud Facebook has had with the academics. </p>



<p>To aid in their research, the group created a browser plug-in called Ad Observer, which collects data on the political ads users see and why they were targeted for the ad. </p>



<p>Specifically, the tool <a href="https://adobserver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collects</a> the advertiser’s name, the ad’s content, information Facebook provided about how the ad was targeted, and when the ad was shown to a user, among other things. It doesn’t collect personal information. The data collected by Ad Observer is then made public.</p>



<p>In October of last year, Facebook said the NYU Ad Observatory’s project violated their terms of service, as the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-shutdown-of-nyu-research-project-into-political-ad-targeting-11603488533?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em> reported at the time. On Wednesday, the social media giant reiterated that in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> explaining their reasoning for the ban. </p>



<p>“While the Ad Observatory project may be well-intentioned, the ongoing and continued violations of protections against scraping cannot be ignored and should be remediated,” Mike Clark, the company’s product management director, wrote in the post. Clark also said the browser extension collected information about Facebook users “who did not install it or consent to the collection.”</p>



<p>However, as <a href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-facebook-researchers-scraping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protocol noted in March</a>, the information collected from accounts that did not “consent to the collection” that Clark appears to be referring to was actually advertisers’ accounts, not private users. </p>



<p>Laura Edelson, a member of Cybersecurity for Democracy, told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-researchers-facebook-disables-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protocol</a> that Facebook was “silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform.” The Daily Dot reached out to Cybersecurity for Democracy for comment, but didn’t immediately hear back. </p>



<p>However, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraEdelson2/status/1422736708433481730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of tweets</a>, Edelson elaborated more on the social media giant’s decision. </p>



<p>“This evening, Facebook suspended my Facebook account and the accounts of several people associated with Cybersecurity for Democracy, our team at NYU. This has the effect of cutting off our access to Facebook’s Ad Library data, as well as Crowdtangle,” Edelson wrote. “Over the last several years, we’ve used this access to uncover systemic flaws in the Facebook Ad Library, identify misinformation in political ads including many sowing distrust in our election system, and to study Facebook’s apparent amplification of partisan misinformation.” </p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work.

</div></figure>



<p>Edelson continued: “By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, including our work measuring vaccine misinformation with the Virality Project and many other partners who rely on our data. The work our team does to make data about disinformation on Facebook transparent is vital to a healthy internet and a healthy democracy.” </p>

  <p id="ux8WbJ">Microsoft launched its new cloud PC Windows 365 service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605800/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-streaming-html5">earlier this week</a>, and the company has already had to pause free trials due to demand. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575064/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-launch-date-price-features">Windows 365 lets you rent a cloud PC</a> — with a variety of CPU, RAM, and storage options — and then stream Windows 10 or Windows 11 via a web browser. The service reached max capacity after only a day of signups.</p>
<p id="o5UwrX">“Following significant demand, we have reached capacity for Windows 365 trials,” reads a statement from the Microsoft 365 Twitter account. “We have seen unbelievable response to Windows 365 and need to pause our free trial program while we provision additional capacity,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RDS4U/status/1422616706485080065">explains Scott Manchester</a>, director of Windows 365 program management.</p>

<p id="e0xp0a">Windows 365 is only available to businesses right now, and there’s clearly been more demand than Microsoft had anticipated if the company has hit capacity issues after just a day of free trials. Microsoft launched the service on Monday, with per-user pricing that starts at $20 per month for one vCPU, 2GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and 12GB of bandwidth if you already have a Windows 10 license.</p>
<p id="UxfiUk">There are a variety of configurations for Windows 365, including one at the top end that includes eight vCPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $158 per month. All of the different price options are available at <a href="http://windows365.com/">Windows365.com</a>, but you’ll now need to <a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-signup-for-updates-windows-from-the-cloud.html?LCID=EN-US">register interest</a> in a free trial as Microsoft has hit capacity.</p>

                            <p>Netflix will stream a documentary next month which will follow the story of the world&#39;s first private all-civilian space orbit.</p><p>The group will board a <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/spacex-6129" target="_blank">SpaceX</a></strong> capsule next month and spend three days orbiting the Earth, becoming Netflix&#39;s first documentary &#34;to cover an event in near real-time&#34;.</p>
<p>The privately chartered flight will be commanded, funded and led by 38-year-old billionaire Jared Isaacman, and aim to support St Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital to the tune of $200 million.</p>


<p>He will be joined on board by Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA candidate, Christopher Sembroski, a US Airforce veteran, and Hayley Arceneaux, a doctor&#39;s assistant at St Jude and childhood cancer survivor.</p><p>The group will apparently reach a higher altitude than the International Space Station as they orbit the planet in the SpaceX Dragon capsule, dubbed Inspiration4.</p>        
<p>The quick-turnaround documentary will be made in five parts, with the first two premiering on 6 September.</p>
<p>Inspiration4&#39;s actual launch is scheduled for 15 September - an event which will feature in the final part at the end of the month.</p><p>Viewers have been promised behind the scenes access of the mission - from their selection, to footage from inside the spacecraft while it orbits Earth.</p>

      <title>Forgotten heroes of the Enigma Story (2018)</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06149-y</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_nature_com_articles_d41586-018-06149-y/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><b>X, Y &amp; Z: The Real Story of How Enigma Was Broken</b> <i>Dermot Turing</i> The History Press (2018) </p><p>Alan Turing’s crucial unscrambling of German messages in the Second World War was a tour de force of codebreaking. From 1940 onwards, Turing and his team engineered hundreds of electronic machines, dubbed bombes, which decrypted the thousands of missives sent by enemy commanders each day to guide their soldiers. This deluge of knowledge shortened the war. Bletchley Park, UK — the secret centre where it all happened — rightly gained its place in history. But as with all breakthroughs, many more people laid the foundations.</p><p>In his book <i>X, Y &amp; Z</i>, Dermot Turing, the great mathematician’s nephew, tells the gripping story of a band of Polish mathematicians who figured out much about how German Enigma encoding machines operated, years before Alan Turing did. The Poles shared their secrets with French and British intelligence services before and during the Second World War — the letters X, Y and Z were shorthand for the French, British and Polish codebreaking teams, respectively.</p><p>The author’s research is painstaking. After the war, military documents were scattered across Europe, and key French records were declassified only in 2016. Many original Polish papers were destroyed, but the mathematicians’ families have shared personal letters. Turing unearths a remarkable tale of intellect, bravery and camaraderie that reads like a nail-biting spy novel.</p><p>Polish skills in cryptography and radio engineering came together during the 1920 Russo-Polish War. Signallers decoded a telegram from Red Army military commander Joseph Stalin, which indicated that an attack on Warsaw was imminent. Jamming the Russians’ radio communications bought enough time to secure and save the city. Maksymilian Ciężki and Antoni Palluth were among those signallers. After the 1920 conflict, Ciężki became leader of a radio-intelligence unit. Palluth set up a business making electronic equipment, including radios the size of a credit card for Polish secret agents.</p><figure>

  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure><p>In 1926, the German navy began to send messages that were scrambled in a more random way, making them almost impossible to decipher. They were encoded using the typewriter-like Enigma machine. The keyboard was wired so that typing one letter lit up a different one in a set of bulbs on top. Rotors altered the path of the electric circuit with every keystroke. The machines were commercially available but modified for German military use. Without knowing the precise setting of a machine, there was no way to unpick the code.</p><p>The book tells how Ciężki hired a group of mathematics students to crack the problem. They worked quietly in basements and in a bunker deep in the woods. Marian Rejewski, an alumnus of Poznań University in Poland, was one. At the helm was Gwido Langer, a Pole who had worked in radio intelligence for the Austrian army.</p><p>Meanwhile, in France, Gustave Bertrand headed the equivalent unit. The French had a more conventional approach to gathering information: good agents, clandestine meetings and generous pay-offs. Bertrand managed two formidable spies. Rudolf Stallmann — code name Rex — was a German card-sharp who had posed as a baron to fleece casino-goers; he picked up languages and people with ease. Rex recruited Hans-Thilo Schmidt, or Agent Asche, whose brother was a colonel in the German army. Schmidt supplied cases of military documents to the French, which Rex received and Bertrand and his colleagues photographed in hotel bathrooms.</p><p>Bertrand built up a network for sharing intelligence, including with Poland and the United Kingdom. In 1931, he agreed to supply Langer with German military documents if the Poles would pass back decrypted German messages. One of those documents, passed on by Schmidt, was a manual for Enigma.</p><figure>

  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure><p>Langer, Ciężki and Rejewski leapt on it. They discovered that a panel added to the front of the machine altered the settings, although they still could not tell how the device was wired. They set about collecting coded messages and applied their wits to find clues. Sometimes the senders made telling mistakes. The German soldiers might use simple sets of three letters, such as QQQ, to broadcast the settings to the receiver. Occasionally, the messages could be guessed: for instance, they often said <i>maschine defekt</i>.</p><p>By 1936, in the run-up to war, the German military was tightening its communications. In October that year, the senders began to reset the Enigma machines daily. Dermot Turing credits another Polish mathematician, Jerzy Różycki, with realizing that this altered the frequency of letters, revealing extra information. The team developed tools to work through the hundreds of permutations, including punched cards and a mechanical device with rotors that mimicked Enigma, which, for uncertain reasons, the team called a <i>bomba</i>. Both concepts were later used and developed by Alan Turing.</p><p>Bertrand fed this information back to Britain’s codebreakers, who come across in the book as humorous but aloof. They called the French dispatches — stamped <i>TRÈS SECRET</i> in red — scarlet pimpernels. In late July 1939, just over a month before the German army marched into Poland, Bertrand arranged for the respected British cryptologist Dillwyn ‘Dilly’ Knox (who was already working on Enigma at Bletchley) to meet Langer’s team near Warsaw. The Poles wanted to pass on their knowledge. Initially angry that they had beaten him to it, Knox later sent the Poles a silk scarf printed with a horse-racing scene to concede that they had won.</p><figure>

  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure><p>The British immediately ramped up codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park; within a few months, Alan Turing had re-engineered the bombes to work more quickly. The Polish insights saved him a year of work.</p><p>When war broke out, the Polish radio-intelligence unit was wound up. The codebreakers buried their notes and machines and fled. Some ended up in Algeria, the rest in France working for Bertrand, who had set up a radio-intelligence group in a chateau in southern France. In breathtaking passages, the book reveals how most of the Polish codebreakers made it through the war, tapping into the French Resistance and dodging Germany’s military-intelligence services and secret police when France became occupied. As valuable assets, the codebreakers were not allowed to fight. Touching photographs in the book show them joking with each other and spending time with girlfriends amid the devastation. </p><p>Eventually, Ciężki and Langer were arrested and interned in the Sudetenland (now part of the Czech Republic). After the war, they settled in Scotland. Palluth was killed in Germany in 1945, when an aeroplane factory in which he was working at Sachsenhausen concentration camp was bombed. Bertrand artfully played all sides. Avoiding becoming a double agent, he ended up a general. In 1972, he wrote a popular French book about Enigma, and so the story of X, Y and Z and Bletchley began to seep out.</p><p>Dermot Turing’s vivid and moving account sets the record straight.</p>

      <title>Ultra fast Thunderbolt NAS with Apple M1 and Linux</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___chrisbergeron_com_2021_07_25_Ultra-fast-Thunderbolt-NAS-with-Apple-M1-and-Linux_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">Thunderbolt is exciting for several reasons, but most notable for me is the sheer speed and bandwidth capability.
<h2 id="Adding-a-Thunderbolt-4-PCIe-Add-on-Card"><a href="#Adding-a-Thunderbolt-4-PCIe-Add-on-Card" title="Adding a Thunderbolt 4 PCIe Add-on Card"></a>Adding a Thunderbolt 4 PCIe Add-on Card</h2><p></p>
<p>Adding a single 4 lane PCIe 3.0 card to an existing NAS server in a SOHO is a relatively straightforward process.  I wasn’t sure that the card I selected would work for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t know if Thunderbolt required modern CPU architecture.  Intel is including Thunderbolt in the CPU of the forthcoming Ice Lake processors (<em>I think</em>), but for now it remains an external add-on chipset.</li>
<li>My NAS, as I suspect many other Homelabbers and hobbyists doesn’t have a state-of-the-art processor or motherboard chipset.</li>
<li>I reasonably concluded that the latest Linux Kernel and corresponding modules/code would support Thunderbolt but I wasn’t sure of the extent of compatibility and/or any “X Factors” that might arise from my specific hardware / software combination and use case.</li>
</ul>
<p>I set aside my trepidation and decided to just try it.  No guts no air medal, right?</p>
<p>There is a hardware “hack” involved with implementing this card in an older motherboard.  Fortunately, it’s an easy one and the card vendor provides almost everything needed in the box.  I haven’t delved into the software override functionality yet, so this hardware modification may not be necessary at all, YMMV.</p>
<p>What’s notable about this configuration is that the motherboard doesn’t have a Thunderbolt (tbt_3 or tbt_4) header and there are no special CPU / chipset requirements.  It’s just an Intel Xeon based motherboard/cpu combination with a Gigabyte GC 2.0 Titan Ridge PCIe Thunderbolt 3 card.</p>
<p>I used the work ‘hack’ lightly above.  To get a server without a dedicated thunderbolt header to see the PCIe card, you need to short pins 3 and 5 together like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In effect, this tells the card that it’s plugged in.  The THB_C port on a “Thunderbolt™ Enabled” motherboard may provide extra DisplayPort capability.  I wasn’t able to find a conclusive reason for the tbt header connection aside from theories about vendor locking.  I’m sure it’s in the Intel Thunderbolt whitepaper (GPIO) but I haven’t looked it over yet.</p>
<p>All I know is that if you get this card and it doesn’t appear in your device list, you may need to short these two wires. <em>I take no responsibility for anything that happens if you do this and something bad happens - please research accordingly.</em></p>
<p>Now that the card is installed and internal cables are connected it’s time to power up the NAS Server.</p>

<h2 id="Host-1-NAS-04-Linux"><a href="#Host-1-NAS-04-Linux" title="Host 1:  NAS-04 (Linux)"></a>Host 1:  NAS-04 (Linux)</h2><p>This host is a Linux server.  It’s running on a Supermicro X10SRL-F motherboard with an Intel Xeon CPU.  The chassis’ are two Supermicro 836A.  <a href="https://chrisbergeron.com/2020/03/07/diy_das_part1/">One chassis is the NAS server, the other is a DAS</a> (Disk shelf) attached to the NAS for a total of 32+ removable disk bays.</p>
<p>After powering up the NAS server we can see the Titan Ridge card using <code>lspci</code>:<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>02:00.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL7540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge [Titan Ridge 4C 2018] (rev 06)</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>We can see more information in the <code>/sys/bus/thunderbolt</code> kernel syspath.  This is the output prior to connecting a thunderbolt cable to another host:<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>root@nas-04:/sys/bus/thunderbolt </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>After connecting the thunderbolt cable the <code>thunderbolt0</code> device comes up as <strong>0-3.0</strong>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>root@nas-04:/sys/bus/thunderbolt </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>… and we can view the relevant kernel message buffer lines (log) with <code>dmesg</code>:<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>[Sun Jul 25 16:24:56 2021] thunderbolt-net 0-3.0 thunderbolt0: ThunderboltIP login timed out</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Interestingly, we can also see that the Mac Mini is immediately auto discovered and that the <code>thunderbolt0</code> network interface has become available.  I thought I would have to start the kernel module (driver) for <code>thunderbolt-net</code>, but it looks like it happened automatically.</p>
<p>You can check to see if the <code>thunderbolt</code> and <code>thunderbolt-net</code> kernel modules are loaded using <code>lsmod</code>.  If you don’t see them listed, you can manually load them with <code>modprobe thunderbolt</code> and <code>modprobe thunderbolt-net</code>.</p>
<p>After the network device becomes available we can address and configure it using standard userspace tools.  I use good old <code>ifconfig</code> to set a non-link-local (not automatic 169.254.x.x) IP address for the interface.  Using <code>ip addr</code> or other userspace tools (GUI) should work just fine.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>root@nas-04:~ </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now that the interface has an IP, we have to add a static host route entry for it to communicate:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><em>Fun linux fact I’ve heard:  The root user’s command prompt is a hashtag (#) so that if someone were to copy and paste a command from a website like this, it would run as a comment and not actually execute the paste buffer (if anyone has a source for this, please comment below).</em></p>
<p>Next, we just need to set up the Thunderbolt routeable IP on the Mac.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="Host-2-Apple-Mac-Mini"><a href="#Host-2-Apple-Mac-Mini" title="Host 2: Apple Mac Mini"></a>Host 2: Apple Mac Mini</h2><p>The other host in this setup a Mac Mini.  Thunderbolt 4 is not a requirement for this setup and neither is Apple Silicon.  Thunderbolt is an Intel™ Specification and any hardware that has license from Intel should work equally well.  This host is running MacOS Big Sur / Monterey.</p>
<p>Here we can see the new network service(s) that came up after connecting the Thunderbolt cable between the machines - <code>Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot 1</code> and <code>Thunderbolt Bridge</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>mini-01:~ cbergeron$ networksetup -listallnetworkservices</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Much the way we set an IP on the Linux host, we will do the same thing on the Mac.  You can set the IP of the TB interface however you want.  Either via the command line with posix tools:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>root@nas-04:~ </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>or macos commands:<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>mini-01:~ cbergeron$ networksetup -getinfo <span>&#34;Thunderbolt Bridge&#34;</span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Or, using the UI:</p>
<p></p>
<!-- NOTE: If you want your routes to persist across reboots, you can use the `networksetup -setadditionalroutes` command [details at this link](http://networknucleus.com/2018/06/07/persistent-static-routes-in-macos/). -->
<p>This is probably the part of this post that you came here for.</p>
<p>To benchmark the connection speed I used <code>iperf3</code> so that disk I/O isn’t a variable.  Even though I’m using tiered storage including NVMe’s on the NAS server, at this point I’m just interested in the connection capability.  Here are the results from <code>iperf3 -s</code> on the Mac mini:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>-----------------------------------------------------------</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Not bad.  Not quite what I was expecting though.  I initially thought I would see closer to 35Gbps (40Gbps minus 10-15% overhead).  This is more inline with 85% of 20 Gbps.</p>
<p>I know that Thunderbolt 3 and 4 are rated at 40Gbps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interesting.  It’s almost exactly half of what I expected.  Could it be that it’s operating at half duplex?</p>
<p>Let’s check the PHY link speed (NAS):<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ cat /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/tx_speed /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/0-1/rx_speed</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><!--
# Takeaway
As I mentioned, this type of setup isn't novel - it's just not well documented online (at least based on my Duck Duck Go search skills).

<!--## Troubleshooting

Can't ping:
  - check firewall rules on both hosts
  - check SE linux policies (on linux hosts)
  - check output of tcpdump -i thunderbolt0 on both ends

USB4 specification is great for transferring small files, which was one of the intended purposes of USB - (cameras, SD cards, etc).  For larger payloads, Thunderbolt has lower overhead and better handling of large block streams (MTU 9000) [VALIDATE AND SUPPORT THIS]

      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A few months ago the trackpad in my work computer stopped working properly. Instead of getting it fixed, I took it as challenge to stop using the mouse entirely. Here are the things I learned and rediscovered.</p><h2>Out of the box</h2><p>You can go pretty far without a mouse using a combination of <code>Tab</code>, <code>Shift+Tab</code> and arrow keys.</p><p>For web browsers, accessible websites such as Google and Wikipedia have focus states for interactive elements and some even contain <code>Jump to navigation</code>, <code>Jump to main content</code> tab-accessible links as the very first things you can tab-navigate to. <code>Page Up</code>, <code>Page Down</code>, <code>Home</code> and <code>End</code> can be used to scroll through web pages and PDF documents. To follow text links, press <code>Ctrl+F</code>, type part of the link text until it matches, press <code>Esc</code> and your link will be focused. Then just press <code>Enter</code>. This can also come in handy for image links and forms: search for a term close to the image or element you want to click or focus on then tab-navigate to it.</p><p>For GUI applications in general, on Windows and Linux pressing <code>Alt</code> on will open and/or focus on the applications menu bars. You can then navigate using the arrow keys and pressing the underlined letters in the menu bar items. Good for discovering keyboard shortcuts, too.</p><h2>Vimium</h2><p>With the <a href="https://github.com/philc/vimium">Vimium</a> extension installed, pressing <code>f</code> will make every visible link on the page get a one-to-three letter shortcut. Type that shortcut, navigate to that page.</p><p>Besides being faster than tab-based navigation, it can be useful during pair-programming sessions: press <code>f</code> and your coworker can simply say out loud the letter sequence of the link he wants you to navigate to.</p><p>Similar ideas in the programming tools space are <a href="https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion">easymotion</a> and <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">avy</a>.</p><h2>Keyboard-driven cursor movement</h2><p>Not all applications support a good keyboard-only experience. No problem. While controlling a virtual keyboard with a mouse is hardly joyful, controlling the cursor with your keyboard makes you look pretty cool.</p><h3>numpad</h3><p>The <code>4862</code> keys are for moving left, up, right and down respectively. <code>7913</code> move diagonally. <code>5</code> clicks.</p><p>To set this up on a Linux with Xorg, run <code>setxkbmap -option keypad:pointerkeys</code> in a terminal then press <code>Shift + Num Lock</code> to make your numeric keypad control the cursor. For more details, check out the <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/HOWTO_use_the_numeric_keyboard_keys_as_mouse_in_XOrg">LinuxReviews wiki</a>.</p><p>On Windows, as things are always changing in the Control Panel World, refer to the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-mouse-keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer-9e0c72c8-b882-7918-8e7b-391fd62adf33">Windows documentation</a>.</p><h3>keynav</h3><p>While the numpad approach works well, it can be a bit slow. keynav applies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning">binary space partitioning</a> idea to mouse navigation. From the <a href="https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/keynav/">keynav website</a>:</p><blockquote><p> You select a piece of the screen. The screen is initially wholely selected. One move will cut that region by half. A move is a direction: up, down, left, and right. </p><p> Once you’re done moving, you simply indicate (with a key stroke) that you want to move. Boom, cursor moves. </p></blockquote><p>In practice, this is done by starting the keynav process, pressing <code>Ctrl-;</code> to pop up an overlay and then repeatedly pressing either <code>hjkl</code> for dividing up the screen, <code>w</code> for moving the cursor to the center of the selection area and <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> or <code>3</code> for left, middle or right clicking.</p><p>Sounds crazy, works pretty well.</p><p>Besides being potentially much faster than numpad navigation, Vimium on a Raspberry Pi can take a few seconds to set up all shortcuts depending on how busy a web page is. keynav feedback is always instantaneous.</p><p>While the project is Linux-only, I wrote a tiny version of keynav for Windows using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> as suggested by the keynav docs. Get it <a href="https://github.com/FelipeCortez/keynav-ahk">here</a>.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>This blog post contains toy implementations of Vimium and keynav.</p><p><code>;</code> opens the keynav overlay. Bisect with <code>hjkl</code>, click a link with <code>1</code>. Press <code>;</code> again to recenter. Press <code>q</code> to cancel.</p><p><code>f</code> opens the Vimium overlay. Press the key for the link to navigate or <code>q</code> to cancel.</p><h2>Why?</h2><ul><li>Put the keyboard on your lap and never move your arms</li><li>One less USB port, maybe</li><li>Set up a Raspberry Pi, GUI mode, without a mouse</li><li>Look cool to your coworkers</li><li>Make your life harder</li></ul><p>As of August 2021, I have been using Vimium for seven years and keynav for six months. I don&#39;t miss having a mouse or trackpad!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Nutrition Science Is Broken. This New Egg Study Shows Why. (2019)</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___undark_org_2019_07_18_science-of-eggs_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<div>
				<div itemprop="articleBody">
					
					<p><span>It’s been</span> a tortuous path for the humble egg. For much of our history, it was a staple of the American breakfast — as in, bacon and eggs. Then, starting in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it began to be disparaged as a dangerous source of artery-clogging cholesterol, a probable culprit behind Americans’ exceptionally high rates of heart attack and stroke. Then, in the past few years, the chicken egg was redeemed and once again touted as an excellent source of protein, unique antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, and many vitamins and minerals, including riboflavin and selenium, all in a fairly low-calorie package.
</p>
<p>
  This March, a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2728487">study published in JAMA</a> put the egg back on the hot seat. It found that the amount of cholesterol in a bit less than two large eggs a day was associated with an increase in a person’s risk of cardiovascular disease and death by 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The risks grow with every additional half egg. It was a really large study, too — with nearly 30,000 participants — which suggests it should be fairly reliable.
</p>
<p>
  So which is it? Is the egg good or bad? And, while we are on the subject, when so much of what we are told about diet, health, and weight loss is inconsistent and contradictory, can we believe any of it?
</p>
<p>
  Quite frankly, probably not. Nutrition research tends to be unreliable because nearly all of it is based on observational studies, which are imprecise, have no controls, and don’t follow an experimental method. As nutrition-research critics Edward Archer and Carl Lavie have <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2017/12/16/nutrition_researchers_have_a_consensus_to_use_bad_science.html">put it</a>, “’Nutrition’ is now a degenerating research paradigm in which scientifically illiterate methods, meaningless data, and consensus-driven censorship dominate the empirical landscape.”
</p>
<p>
  Other nutrition research critics, such as <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2698337">John Ioannidis</a> of Stanford University, have been similarly scathing in their commentary. They point out that observational nutrition studies are essentially just surveys: Researchers ask a group of study participants — a cohort — what they eat and how often, then they track the cohort over time to see what, if any, health conditions the study participants develop.
</p>
<p>
  The trouble with the approach is that no one really remembers what they ate. You might remember today’s breakfast in some detail. But, breakfast three days ago, in precise amounts? Even the unadventurous creature of habit would probably get it wrong. That tends to make these surveys inaccurate, especially when researchers try to drill down to specific foods.
</p>
<p>
  Then, that initial inaccuracy is compounded when scientists use those guesses about eating habits to calculate the precise amounts of specific proteins and nutrients that a person consumed. The errors add up, and they can lead to seriously dubious conclusions.
</p>
<p>
  A good example is the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cncr.21332">2005 study</a> that suggested that eating a cup of endive once a week might cut a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer by 76 percent. There was even a possible mechanism to explain the effect: Endive is high in kaempferol, a flavonoid that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3102233/">has shown</a> anticarcinogenic properties in laboratory experiments. It was a big study, based on a cohort of more than 62,000 women. This study was published in the prestigious journal Cancer, and many in the media were convinced. Dr. Mehmet Oz even <a href="https://www.doctoroz.com/videos/anti-cancer-diet-1">touted it</a> on his television show.
</p>
<p>
  But, as Maki Inoue-Choi, of the University of Minnesota, and her colleagues <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635581.2013.748921">pointed out</a>, the survey had asked about many other kaempferol-rich foods — including some that had higher levels of kaempferol than endive does — and not one of those other foods had the same apparent effect on ovarian cancer.
</p>
<p>
  The new study linking eggs and cardiovascular disease deserves similar scrutiny. Statistically speaking, 30,000 participants makes for a very powerful study. And in fairness, the study’s defenders say that it did a good job accounting for factors that might have influenced the findings, such as overall fat consumption, smoking, and lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
  But on the other hand, the study tracked participants’ health outcomes over periods ranging from 13 to more than 30 years, and participants were queried about their diet only once, at the beginning of the study. Can we assume that the participants gave a reliable depiction of their diet at the outset, and then that they maintained that same diet for the years — in many cases, decades — that followed? Probably not. Who eats the same way for 10 years?
</p>
<p>
  In light of these flaws, Dr. Anthony Pearson, a cardiologist at St. Luke’s Hospital in suburban St. Louis, had this advice: “Rather than drastically cutting egg consumption,” <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/blogs/skeptical-cardiologist/79361">he wrote</a> in a blog for MedPage Today, “I propose that there be a drastic cut in the production of weak observational nutrition studies and a moratorium on inflammatory media coverage of meaningless nutritional studies.”
</p>
<p>
  Instead of observational studies, most nutrition scientists would rather see experimental studies like those performed by the late Dr. Jules Hirsch. A pioneer in the study of obesity, Hirsch got his start in the 1950s, long before weight control became the problem that it is today. He took a relatively unglamorous, ignored area of medical health and made it extremely interesting. To this day, his controlled experiments on human nutrition are considered a gold-standard in nutrition science. He discovered that when a person diets, their heart rate slows, they feel cold, and their immune system is undermined.
</p>
<p>
  But here’s the rub: Hirsch worked at Rockefeller University — a serene little campus tucked away on the Upper East Side of Manhattan — where researchers are free to follow their muse, free of teaching duties. Rockefeller University also has a hospital. Between that and the endowment support, Hirsch was able to do research that would have been impractical to do virtually anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
  Hirsch started with basic science, looking at fat cells and how they functioned. Then he moved on to patients. He would admit them to the university hospital and keep them there, assigning them to a metabolic ward where he could control nearly everything they ate. That was critical, because it is really hard to be on a restricted diet, and there are temptations.
</p>
<p>
  In perhaps his most famous study, Hirsch admitted 18 obese men and women to the hospital together with 23 people who had never been obese. He fed them all mostly a liquid diet to control their calories precisely. First, he had them maintain their initial weight and took measurements. Then he had them gain 10 percent of their initial weight and took measurements. Finally, he limited their portions, causing them to go at least 10 percent below their initial weight, and repeated the measurements a third time.
</p>
<p>
  The experiment revealed the now-well-known fact that when an individual loses weight, their metabolism slows. That’s what makes it so hard to lose weight — and to keep the weight off afterward.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, it is impractical — and probably impossible — for most researchers to carry out those types of studies on a large scale. Crunching the data from a big observational study is a much easier way to get a publication and some media attention. So we get what we get.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, what do the rest of us do with our diets?
</p>
<p>
  Most experts recommend avoiding processed foods as much as possible and sticking with a Mediterranean-like diet because it makes intuitive sense. It is not too restrictive. It is heavy in fruits and vegetables. It has the right kinds of fats and some grains. It includes fish and generally lean proteins.
</p>
<p>
  These experts contend that you should also be wary about foods that are said to have newly revealed healthy, or unhealthy, properties. In other words, don’t buy the notion of superfoods. The evidence is just not there.
</p>
<p>
  In an email, Michael Blaha, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University who has written about methodological issues with nutritional science, told me he finds “particularly distasteful studies of one particular food (e.g., broccoli) or one particular macronutrient,” because “it is impossible to disentangle the effect of one particular food or one macronutrient from the accompanying foods and macronutrients that characterize a typical dietary pattern.”
</p>
<p>
  To put it another way: Eat what you like but keep it balanced. And, perhaps, long live the omelet!

      <title>Good Design is Imperfect Design, Part 1: Honest Names</title>

<p>by Eric Evans</p>



<p>Perfectionism is a pitfall. For those who, like me, love elegant design and see its utility, there is a slippery slope waiting when a satisfying design does not emerge in a reasonable time. It takes constant self-discipline to recognize this and accept, let go, ship and move on – or return in a later cycle, if it matters. It doesn’t always matter. For many parts of our systems, a good-enough design is good enough. And for those few strategically important parts, where an incisive model and a crisp design are actually likely to affect the outcome of the project, a great initial design doesn’t usually emerge immediately. We’ll need iteration and experimentation. None of our goals is furthered by grinding and dawdling, waiting for a design we can be proud of in version one.</p>



<p>For my own part, I try to go a bit beyond acceptance. When I am struggling with some part of the design, I often make design choices that explicitly responds the design problems themselves. This helps me let go and move on, and it can improve the chance for change in a later iteration.</p>



<p>In this short series I’ll describe a few techniques I use that help me take the step of shipping something I’m not happy with while also potentially leaving a good path for improvement in future iterations.</p>



<h2>Part 1: Honest Names</h2>



<p>An honest name isn’t always an intention-revealing name. That is only the case when we succeed in <em>fulfilling our intention </em>with a design element. But this does not always happen. In this article, we are considering those unfortunate times when the nice solution doesn’t come.</p>



<p>I need a specific example to illustrate the approach. It would be easy to pick apart some poorly designed software, but it is much more interesting to examine the imperfections in something that is generally well-designed. JodaTime is a Java library for date/time, very widely used as an open source library and eventually adopted, in a modified form, as a standard library for Java. It is well-designed – but not perfect, of course. (After all, it shipped!)</p>



<h3>Consider ‘Plus’</h3>



<p>The JodaTime library allows us to declare times, such as a date, and periods of time:</p>



<p>The ‘plus’ operation is versatile. It works seamlessly with different kinds of periods:</p>



<p>The code seems very expressive and clear. And yet…</p>



<p><code>2021-01-30.plus(1 month) ⇒ ?</code></p>



<p>Remember, February is a short month! I can think of at least three plausible responses. To know what it actually does, I ran the code:</p>



<p><code>2021-01-30.plus(1 month) ⇒ 2021-02-28</code></p>



<p>This seems like a reasonable default behavior, but it is not obvious. The fact that I had to run the code (or look up a document somewhere) to know what would happen, even after some experience using the operation, highlights a flaw in the model. But what is wrong with it, and what could be done?</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll focus on the name. The word ‘plus’ seems to fit what is happening in my first few examples, but it gives no hint about how we handle irregularities, such as months of different lengths.</p>



<p>And this brings us to “Honest Names”. A simple name like ‘plus’ can actually be misleading if the behavior of the operation is complicated. What could it be called instead?</p>



<p><code>t.plusRounded(p)</code></p>



<p>Any of these would have at least given me a clue. They are also <em>awkward</em>!</p>



<h3>Give Awkward Names to Awkward Concepts</h3>



<p>Let’s look some more at the ‘plus’ operation in JodaTime, and why ‘plus’ is a confusing name. (Here I’ll just write ‘plus’ as ‘+’ for easier reading.)</p>



<p><code>2021-03-30 + 1 month ⇒ 2021-04-30</code></p>



<p>Should those two expressions actually have the same value?</p>



<p>Take a guess at the value of these two expressions:</p>



<p>Does it seem like the answer should be the same?</p>



<p>Here are the actual answers:</p>



<p>Periods can also be combined with ‘plus’, so</p>



<p>And therefore,</p>



<p>And here we come to an insight about what is wrong with calling this ‘plus’: <em>The name has connotations that do not apply in our context!</em> In math, the ‘plus’ operation has properties such as associativity:</p>



<p>By the way, I like to keep adding to my list of possible alternative names for a thing. Here are a few more that occur to me at this point:</p>



<p><code>t.plusRounded(p)</code></p>



<p><code>t.plusNonAssociative(p)</code></p>



<p>We must ship! The JodaTime designers may have noticed this issue at the time. (I don’t know anything about the inside of that project.) If they did notice, they still made the right call, in my opinion. They shipped a very useful and generally quite clean library — that was not perfect. They must have made similar decisions many times. Some issues they noticed and some they did not.</p>



<p>However, in a case when you have decided to ship something with awkward bits that you recognize, consider giving it an honest, awkward name. This can communicate to future users, and can help future iterations of the design.</p>



<p>A clean name shuts down our thinking.</p>



<p>An awkward name provokes new ideas.</p>



<h2>Coming in Part 2: Refinement in a Later Iteration</h2>



<p>Accepting a flaw in our design doesn’t mean we forget about it! In part two, we’ll take a quick look at an alternative concept that might emerge in a later iteration to relieve the awkwardness.</p>

      <title>Convincing Xcode to map Vim keys</title>
      <link>https://bryce.co/xcode-vim-map/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___bryce_co_xcode-vim-map_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I&#39;ve tried to make it clear in the title, but hopefully you haven&#39;t gotten to this page thinking that
Apple provides a built-in way to add custom key mappings in Xcode 13&#39;s new Vim Mode.
Unfortunately, this functionality just isn&#39;t easily configurable.</p><p>Instead, this is one of those “but everything&#39;s a <em>little</em> configurable with enough swizzling &amp; pointer arithmetic” kind of posts.</p><hr/><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2><hr/><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>First things first: Xcode 13 is the first Xcode release to offer a built-in Vim Mode!</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is huge news - I&#39;ve only really gotten into vim in the last few years,
but it&#39;s one of those things that I don&#39;t think I could ever leave behind at this point.</p><p>I&#39;m a big fan of the <a href="https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2">XVim</a> plugin for this reason, so seeing vim functionality added directly to Xcode is great.
This is especially true since XVim is the last Xcode plugin I still commonly use - proper vim functionality in Xcode might mean not having to worry about managing plugins at all in the future.</p><p>That being said, while this is a significant step forward either way,
it&#39;s not exactly a full implementation, as indicated by Apple&#39;s own fairly toned-down
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210801014803/https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">description</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Many common key combinations and editing modes familiar to Vim users are supported directly within the code editor…</p></blockquote><p>Now I really want to emphasize here - I&#39;m still already loving this feature.</p><p>Of course there are some bits of functionality that I&#39;ve found myself missing when using it so far - apparently I like to jump to specific line numbers using commands like <code>:25</code> a lot -
but this feature has launched with enough functionality to cover what I want to do the majority of the time.</p><p><em>Except</em> for one big thing, which I have so far been unable to get over - I do normally have my escape key mapped to something else.</p><p>Well, in insert mode, at least. That part of my <code>.vimrc</code> file looks like this:</p><p><code>imap jk &lt;Esc&gt;</code></p><p>… which is really wonderful - it maps a <em>sequence</em> of keys - the <code>j</code> key, followed by the <code>k</code> key in quick succession - to exit insert mode.
It&#39;s a common mapping, and for good reason - it&#39;s just a quick double-tap on the home row to switch modes.</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/xcode-vim-map/vim-example-light.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><source src="/" type="video/webm"/><source src="/" type="video/ogg"/></video>
<video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/xcode-vim-map/vim-example-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><source src="/" type="video/webm"/><source src="/" type="video/ogg"/></video><p>The keys used - along with the exact behavior, where you get a sort of “fake” <code>j</code>
until it resolves based on another keypress or a timeout - makes this a difficult
thing to implement using software outside of Xcode.</p><p>But not only is it a core part of my muscle memory now
(I was surprised how much the characters <code>jk</code> kept appearing in Xcode without this mapping available),
but also something that I just don&#39;t want to get rid of; I found this to be my preference ages ago, and I don&#39;t want
to learn something else just to appease Xcode.</p><p>So instead, let&#39;s see if we can bring Xcode over to our side.</p><hr/><h2 id="finding-xcodes-vim-implementation">Finding Xcode&#39;s Vim Implementation</h2><p>As is often the case with this sort of thing, we only really have a couple of steps to cover:</p><ol><li>Figure out where this logic is being handled</li><li>Change said logic</li></ol><p>So let&#39;s start with the first. When using Vim Mode, Xcode includes a new bottom bar that lists some currently-available actions:</p><p></p><p></p><p>One good starting option is to search for those action names and try to find where they&#39;re used - it&#39;s not a super-precise method, but it&#39;s fast and often works.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">% <span>cd</span> /Applications/Xcode-13.0b4.app
% rg --binary <span>&#34;yank \(copy\)&#34;</span> <span># rg = `ripgrep`</span>
Binary file Contents/SharedFrameworks/SourceEditor.framework/Versions/A/SourceEditor matches
</code></pre></div><p>A single match in a framework called <code>SourceEditor</code> - if anything I&#39;d expect a match in a localized file,
containing something like <code>&#34;YANK_DESCRIPTION&#34; = &#34;yank (copy)&#34;</code>, after which we would search for <code>YANK_DESCRIPTION</code>. But hey, works for me!</p><p>Next we can open <code>SourceEditor</code> in a disassembler like <a href="https://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper</a>, and then search for our “yank (copy)” string again.
This gives a result that appears to be referenced by a function named <code>SourceEditor.ViYankToEndOfParagraphDownCommand.init</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>;</span> DATA <span>XREF</span><span>=</span>_<span>$s12SourceEditor33ViYankToEndOfParagraphDownCommandC13eventConsumerAcA0c5EventL0C_tcfcTf4gg_n</span>+414

</code></pre></div><p>A class name starting with <code>Vi</code> is good news!
We have more digging to do, but the <code>SourceEditor</code> framework seems like the right place to start.</p><hr/><h2 id="finding-input-handling-logic">Finding Input Handling Logic</h2><p>Tracing through the rest of this using a disassembler is probably more effort than it&#39;s worth.</p><p>Instead, let&#39;s open up Xcode 13, attach a debugger to it, and put a breakpoint on all of the <code>SourceEditor.ViYankToEndOfParagraphDownCommand</code> methods.
That way, if we perform a yank-to-end-of-paragraph in Vim Mode, we should hit our breakpoint.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">% lldb

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> process attach --name Xcode
Process <span>20279</span> stopped

Breakpoint 1: <span>22</span> locations.

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> <span>continue</span>
Process <span>20279</span> resuming
</code></pre></div><p>It is at this point that I am realizing that I have no idea how to yank to the end of a paragraph. Google says <code>y}</code>?</p><p>That doesn&#39;t seem to hit the breakpoint though, and it&#39;s unclear if it&#39;s from me doing the wrong thing or if this breakpoint didn&#39;t land somewhere useful.</p><p>Looking back in Hopper for other <code>SourceEditor.Vi</code>-prefixed classes, <code>SourceEditor.ViReplaceCharacterCommandHandler</code> jumps out as a good second option.
I definitely know how to replace a character (should be <code>r</code>, followed by the replacement) and this class has a <code>CommandHandler</code> suffix rather than just <code>Command</code> - sounds like something that definitely should
have a method called on it when a replacement happens.</p><p>After setting up the breakpoint and trying to replace a character, we&#39;re in luck!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Target 0: <span>(</span>Xcode<span>)</span> stopped.

</code></pre></div><p>From this stacktrace, we can see the following flow:</p><ol><li>Starting at the bottom, some general app/window logic that&#39;s slowly bubbling up an <code>NSEvent</code> (frame <code>#17</code> up through <code>#12</code>)</li><li>Xcode-specific handling of that event in <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView.keyDown</code> (frames <code>#11</code> and <code>#10</code>)</li><li>Vim-specific handling of that event in <code>IDESourceEditor.IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> (frame <code>#9</code>)</li></ol><p>There&#39;s more vim handling above that as well, but things become messier as we go.</p><hr/><h2 id="where-to-hook">Where to Hook</h2><p>Now that we have even the smallest insight into what the control flow for a vim command looks like,
it&#39;s clear that we&#39;re probably not going to be able to understand the whole system without a lot of effort:
there are events, event consumers, event consumer contexts, commands, command interfaces, command handlers…
I&#39;d probably have trouble wrapping my head around it even with source code &amp; documentation.</p><p>Instead, let&#39;s find a smaller area to focus on. We mostly just want to tell Xcode that it&#39;s actually receiving different inputs.
That&#39;s not all we need to do - at some point, we will have to figure out how to do things like check which vim mode we&#39;re currently in -
but we can burn that bridge when we get to it.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the <code>IDESourceEditor.IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> method that we called out above.
It&#39;s the lowest vim-specific frame in the stack; low enough that it&#39;s only really dealing with <code>NSEvent</code>, so
whatever logic handles mapping a keypress to a command likely happens after this point.</p><p>We can disable our original breakpoint and add a new one on this <code>IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> method:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> br disable <span>2</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Back in Xcode, we can now hit any key to reach our breakpoint, since we&#39;re no longer breaking on character-replacement-logic;
I&#39;ll start by using the mouse to move to Line 1, and then hitting the <code>j</code> key, which should move us down to Line 2; and the breakpoint is indeed hit!</p><p>We can now print out some information about the event we&#39;re working with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Target 0: <span>(</span>Xcode<span>)</span> stopped.

If we type <code>continue</code> in <code>lldb</code>, and go back to Xcode, we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve moved down to Line 2.</p><p>Now let&#39;s see if we can actually impact the result of a keypress. Back in Xcode, we can hit <code>j</code> again, starting the move down to Line 3.</p><p>In lldb though, we&#39;ll skip out on this method&#39;s logic entirely and simply return early. Based on the stacktrace above, our <code>IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code>
method is expected to return a <code>Bool</code> - likely indicating whether or not it actually handled the key event. Let&#39;s start by returning <code>true</code> early:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Target 0: <span>(</span>Xcode<span>)</span> stopped.

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> thread <span>return</span> <span>true</span>

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> <span>continue</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After checking back in Xcode, we&#39;re still on Line 2! This makes sense - we&#39;ve effectively said that <code>IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> has successfully handled the key
event, but didn&#39;t actually do anything with it.</p><p>Let&#39;s try the inverse. We&#39;re still on Line 2; hitting <code>j</code> again brings us back to our breakpoint:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Target 0: <span>(</span>Xcode<span>)</span> stopped.

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> thread <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
* thread <span>#1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = breakpoint 3.1</span>

<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> <span>continue</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And looking back in Xcode… hm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Saying that <code>IDEViEventConsumer</code> did not handle the key event meant a <code>j</code> character was inserted
into our line, despite us having been in normal mode (in fact, we still are).</p><p>This points to one of two possibilities:</p><ol><li><code>IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> is expected to handle all keypresses when Vim Mode is enabled.
Our <code>thread return false</code> meant that we fell back to some non-vim-mode handler, which naturally just inserted a <code>j</code> character; this wouldn&#39;t happen in normal use.</li><li><code>IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent</code> actually only handles <em>some</em> keypresses in vim mode, like for navigation or switching between modes.
General typing in insert mode is handled by some other event consumer later in the chain.</li></ol><p>That distinction might affect our path forward here, so let&#39;s see if we can figure out which is true.
The easiest way to do that is to check what values this method is returning in different scenarios.</p><p>Back in Xcode, another <code>j</code> press to hit our breakpoint - this time, let&#39;s step out of the frame, and then check the <code>rax</code> register to see what value was returned:</p><blockquote><p>Note: If you&#39;re trying to replicate the steps in this post on an M1-based Mac, the return value here should be in $x0 instead; note that I haven&#39;t tested any part of this post on an M1 though - sorry!</p></blockquote><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> finish

Next, let&#39;s enter insert mode; we can follow the same process to see a return value of <code>1</code> again for the <code>i</code> keypress that entered the mode.</p><p>Finally, another <code>j</code> press - but now when we check the return value:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> finish

In that case, we&#39;ll want to hook into things one level down on the stack, in <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView.keyDown</code>.</p><p>This might make some things harder (like figuring out vim-specific context like what mode we&#39;re in; presumably, that would have been easier to access from a class called <code>IDEViEventConsumer</code>!), but it&#39;s necessary in order for us to manipulate events within insert mode.</p><p>Then again, it might make some things a lot easier - from the stacktrace above, it looks like there is an <code>@objc</code> entrance to <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView.keyDown</code>,
meaning we should be able to swizzle it.

I think there are a few templates around that could be useful, but I usually prefer to know what I&#39;m changing, especially when there are few enough steps, so:</p><ol><li><p>Start with File &gt; New Project, and pick the macOS Bundle template.
Project Name (I&#39;m using <code>XcodeVimMap</code>) and Organization Identifier are up to you, but change the Bundle Extension to <code>xcplugin</code>.</p></li><li><p>Add a new Obj-C Header / Implementation file using File &gt; New &gt; File, Cocoa Class. I&#39;ll use my project name for this class name as well - <code>XcodeVimMap</code>.</p><p>Here&#39;s what my implementation file looks like to start with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>#</span><span>import &#34;XcodeVimMap.h&#34;</span><span>

Add the associated UUID of the Xcode app version you&#39;re developing for as a <code>string</code> item within the array; you can get the UUID using:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">defaults <span>read</span> /Applications/<span>{</span>PATH_TO_XCODE<span>}</span>.app/Contents/Info DVTPlugInCompatibilityUUID

but I&#39;m not really qualified to know what they are or speak much about them; but probably do some research is this if your first foray into plugins).</p></li><li><p>Build the plugin and copy the resulting product into <code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/</code>.</p></li><li><p>Launch Xcode from the command line, searching the output for news from your plugin:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">/Applications/<span>{</span>PATH_TO_XCODE<span>}</span>.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode 2&gt;<span>&amp;</span><span>1</span> <span>|</span> grep XcodeVimMap
</code></pre></div><p>If you set up everything correctly, you should get a prompt within Xcode asking you if you want to load the bundle (<code>Unexpected code bundle &#34;...&#34;</code>). Note that the button you want is the non-highlighted one.
After loading the bundle, you should see the <code>XcodeVimMap Loaded</code> output in your terminal.</p><blockquote><p>Note: If you see any output about the plugin not being loaded, such as <code>Skipping plug-in at path &#39;.../XcodeVimMap.xcplugin&#39;</code>,
it&#39;s likely related to the Info.plist values specified above; double-check them before anything else.</p></blockquote></li></ol><p>If everything worked, there are two additional steps you can do to make development quicker:</p><ol><li><p>In your target&#39;s Build Settings, change <code>Installation Build Products Location</code> to <code>$(HOME)</code>, and <code>Installation Directory</code> to <code>/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins</code>.
This will prevent you from having to copy the product over after each build.</p></li><li><p>In your scheme&#39;s settings, on the Run tab, and the Info sub-tab, change your <code>Executable</code> to be the copy of Xcode that you&#39;re developing for.
This will let you hit the Run button to launch another instance of Xcode after building, see its log output, and debug it. Note that as of writing,
you&#39;ll also have to uncheck <code>Enable user interface debugging</code> in the Options sub-tab, or you&#39;ll get an error message about being unable to load a debugger plugin.</p><p>Xcode is fairly slow with a debugger attached,
so if the debugger isn&#39;t a core part of your workflow,
it&#39;s worth unchecking the <code>Debug executable</code> box in the Info sub-tab -
though we will be using it for parts of this post.</p></li></ol><p>With all that out of the way, we now have a general Xcode plugin set up - we can now start adding some vim-specific code to it.</p><hr/><h2 id="swizzling-the-event-handler">Swizzling the Event Handler</h2><p>We determined earlier that <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView.keyDown</code> was likely the ideal method to target here, so let&#39;s start by swizzling it in our plugin.</p><p>First, let&#39;s add a breakpoint on our <code>NSLog</code> statement in <code>pluginDidLoad:</code>

there are a few things we should try out, since we&#39;ll need them for our final implementation;
better to make sure they work now rather than later.</p><h4 id="sending-delayed-inputs">Sending Delayed Inputs</h4><p>As mentioned earlier in this post, the remap functionality we&#39;re looking for
adds a ‘fake’ <code>j</code> when the key is pressed, before fully committing to it; this way,
vim can determine if the next key is a <code>k</code> (indicating we should exit) or if the
user really just meant to type <code>j</code>.</p><p>There are two rough proxies of that that I can think of:</p><ol><li>Don&#39;t insert a <code>j</code> at all when we receive a keypress, until either the next key is pressed
or a time threshold has passed. If the next key is <code>k</code>, don&#39;t insert the <code>j</code> at all, just exit.</li><li>Do insert a <code>j</code> under the assumption that it is wanted. If the next key is <code>k</code>, delete the <code>j</code>, then exit.</li></ol><p>I like the first option a lot more - anything that deals with deleting content starts to get tricky,
even in a situation where you have full control over things - which we don&#39;t. Doing something simple like sending
a <code>backspace</code> event leads to problems if, for example, the user has clicked on another line or
highlighted some text with their mouse in the meantime
(I guess that might introduce issues in either case, but still; option 1 feels the least destructive).</p><p>In either case, we need the ability to send an event at a time when it didn&#39;t originally occur.
This is probably perfectly fine, but might as well test while we&#39;re here.</p><p>An easy way to do so would be to
send the same input multiple times, with one coming after a delay. This isn&#39;t guaranteed to work if these events used
some sort of nonce-based system, but that seems unlikely, and we can debug if needed. So let&#39;s try it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>BOOL</span><span>)</span><span>swizzled_keyDown:</span><span>(</span><span>NSEvent</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>event</span> <span>{</span>

at the same time. Let&#39;s use essentially the same setup, without the delay, to confirm that
Xcode allows for this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>BOOL</span><span>)</span><span>swizzled_keyDown:</span><span>(</span><span>NSEvent</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>event</span> <span>{</span>

I omitted that from the <code>modifiedEvent:</code> method earlier, so looks like we&#39;ll have to add it in.</p><p>Except… that doesn&#39;t work! Even after adding the keycode in, and getting a modified event whose
debug description looks <em>exactly</em> like an original Escape key event, it doesn&#39;t actually work
for exiting insert mode. There must be some underlying state that&#39;s not exposed here that&#39;s
set for Escape key events. Capturing an Escape key event and replaying it in the future works,
which supports this theory as well.</p><p>I was stuck on this for a while - I started looking at what private ivars <code>NSEvent</code> might have,
trying to figure out what part of the vim implementation was responsible for checking the escape
button press (with no luck), and so on.</p><p>At some point I ended up looking at a dumped <code>NSEvent.h</code> header to see what else might be relevant,
and saw that there was an undocumented <code>-[NSEvent _isEscapeKeyEvent:]</code> method - looking at its implementation
revealed the issue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> po escapeEvent.characters


<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> p escapeEvent.characters.length
<span>(</span>NSUInteger<span>)</span> <span>$3</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I was too easily misled by the event&#39;s debug description; these weren&#39;t empty strings at all. They&#39;re <code>@&#34;\x1b&#34;</code> - a string containing only the escape character,
which uses key code <code>0x1b</code>.</p><p>Yea, that one&#39;s on me.</p><p>Good news is that <code>[XcodeVimMap modifiedEvent:event withCharacters:@&#34;\x1b”]</code> does indeed work! Remapping from any key to this modified event,
using a similar setup to the <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> swap above, lets us use that key to leave insert mode. That should cover everything we need from the <code>NSEvent</code>
modification &amp; replay side.</p><hr/><h2 id="determining-which-vim-mode-were-in">Determining Which Vim Mode We&#39;re In</h2><p>If the end goal is to make a <code>j</code> input followed by a <code>k</code> input leave insert mode, then we have to have a way
to tell if we&#39;re actually <em>in</em> insert mode. If we didn&#39;t care, we probably could have done this whole thing with software outside
of Xcode.</p><p>But having an app-wide (or system-wide) delay on my <code>j</code> key sounds terrible, even if just for navigating in vim&#39;s normal mode.
To do this properly, we really need to be able to find which mode we&#39;re in.</p><p>Some part of Xcode&#39;s Vim system has this knowledge, since it&#39;s making decisions about what keys should do at any given point in time;
this might require some digging to find, but it&#39;s easier to start with objects we&#39;ve seen before.</p><p>In the stacktrace we saw earlier for handling a Character Replace, there were a bunch of interesting classes referenced - one that
really jumps out by name is <code>SourceEditor.ViEventConsumer.Context</code>.</p><p>From that same stacktrace, it looks like there&#39;s a <code>SourceEditor.ViCommand.perform(...)</code> function that gets this context as its first argument -
let&#39;s switch back to the debugger and set a breakpoint there:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> b -r SourceEditor.ViCommand.perform

And second of all - there&#39;s our Vim Mode, right at the top!</p><p>There are a few hoops that we&#39;re going to have to jump through here. We&#39;re starting with a <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView</code> instance from
our swizzled method; we need to use that to get an <code>IDESourceEditor.IDEViEventConsumer</code> instance (the owner of the method we were
first investigating hooking). We can presumably use that to get this <code>ViEventConsumer.Context</code> instance, and from there, we need a way
to access this <code>mode</code> property&#39;s value.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the middle hoop, going from <code>IDESourceEditor.IDEViEventConsumer</code> to <code>ViEventConsumer.Context</code>.</p><h4 id="searching-ivars">Searching Ivars</h4><p>We can start by pausing in the same method that we were working with previously:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> b IDESourceEditor.IDEViEventConsumer.handleKeyEvent

I&#39;m more used to iOS, where there&#39;s a nice built-in way to do this via <code>-[NSObject _ivarDescription]</code> and <code>-[NSObject _methodDescription]</code>, added by an <code>NSObject</code> category in <code>UIKitCore</code>, but those won&#39;t help us on macOS.</p><p>There are also some lldb scripts that could help with this, but after some trying, they don&#39;t seem to work properly in this scenario in particular.</p><p>Let&#39;s just look at the ivars manually:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> e -- unsigned int <span>$ivarCount</span> <span>=</span> 0<span>;</span>

for this same purpose. My understanding is that <code>valueForKey:</code> should fall back to searching for ivars of the same name (both with and without underscore prefixes).
This class isn&#39;t overriding the default <code>valueForKey:</code> implementation, and doesn&#39;t have <code>accessInstanceVariablesDirectly</code> overridden to return <code>NO</code>. Direct ivar access works either way, but still - let me know if you know why <code>valueForKey:</code> doesn&#39;t work here!</p></blockquote><p>After a bit of searching through the ivars of <code>VIEventConsumer.Context</code>, it looks like we can then get the current vim mode
using a similar strategy, this time by looking for an ivar named <code>&#34;mode&#34;</code>.</p><p>One note here is that <code>object_getIvar</code> has a return type
of <code>NSObject *</code>, but this is somewhat broken for primitive types - they aren&#39;t wrapped in an <code>NSNumber</code> or the like,
but rather, their values are simply returned as-is by the method. Not a pointer to anything, just the raw scalar value.

well enough to do anything other than acknowledge that each item in this array appears to be stored in pairs of pointers (one to the instance itself,
and the other related to the protocol witness table).</p><p>The first line of the output also clearly shows a pointer, though lldb doesn&#39;t print out any info about it here. Let&#39;s try to do so manually:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> po 0x00007fd0d18550d8
_TtGCs23_ContiguousArrayStorageP12SourceEditor29SourceEditorViewEventConsumer__$
// demangled: Swift._ContiguousArrayStorage&lt;SourceEditor.SourceEditorViewEventConsumer&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>So this is indeed an array (or at least, “array storage”?) but how do we get it back into a reasonable format?</p><p>I tried a few quick options - like passing this pointer to a Swift-based function and converting it there, or calling <code>_bridgeToObjectiveC</code> manually - but no luck. Possibly
because this is not technically an array, or possibly because I&#39;m doing something completely wrong.</p><p>I would spend more time digging, but it&#39;s hard to justify when the instance we want is <em>right there</em>. So let&#39;s just figure out how to read it ourselves.</p><p>First we need to know how many objects are in the array - we could make a guess based on some of the first few values printed by <code>lldb</code> above (<code>0x03</code>? <code>0x0d</code>? <code>0x20</code>?),
but we also know that <code>SourceEditor.SourceEditorView.keyDown</code> must look at this memory to get the <code>IDEViEventConsumer</code> instance itself, so let&#39;s see if we can figure out what it does.</p><p>Looking through that method in a disassembler, just a bit before the offset in the method that we jump from based on our initial stacktrace, we can see the following instructions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm"><span>mov</span>   <span>r15</span><span>,</span> <span>qword</span> <span>[</span><span>rax</span><span>+</span><span>0x10</span><span>]</span>

<span>je</span>    <span>loc_3633ae</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This looks like an initial check to see if our array is empty; it&#39;s reading the value at <code>0x10</code> bytes from the <code>rax</code> register (which presumably, by this point, holds a pointer to our array storage); then <code>test r15, r15</code> is essentially checking if the value is less than or equal to zero.
This implies that the array length is kept at offset <code>0x10</code> - in our case, that corresponds to the <code>0x0d</code> value in the above <code>lldb</code>&#39;s output, i.e., 13 items in the array.</p><p>We now have enough information to read this data and convert it to an NSArray instance ourselves:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>NSArray</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>arrayFromSwiftArrayStorage:</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>swiftArrayStorage</span> <span>{</span>

and this post is getting quite long as-is.</p></blockquote><p>Now back to the above <code>TODO</code> section; when we detect a <code>j</code> keypress in insert mode,
we want to store it rather than sending immediately:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Check if we&#39;ve received a &#34;j&#34; keypress

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>With this change, it&#39;s not impossible to type a <code>j</code> in insert mode. Let&#39;s add a new check above it, which will apply our prior <code>j</code> keypress whenever a new keypress comes in:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Check if we have a previous `j` press queued up
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>queuedEvent</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here&#39;s the current result, shown by typing the start of the english alphabet with a roughly-constant time between keys; you can see the <code>j</code> key is not sent until the <code>k</code> key
is pressed after it.</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">

</span><span></span>    <span>dispatch_block_cancel</span><span>(</span><span>sendQueuedEventAfterTimeout</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here&#39;s the same test as before, just typing up through <code>j</code> this time. Despite hitting <code>j</code> after the same delay as the other keys,
you can see Xcode hold on to the press again, but this time automatically apply it after a second of inactivity:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">

corresponds to a <code>k</code> keypress - and if we have a <code>j</code> key queued up, we know we want to exit insert mode instead of applying either.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Check if we&#39;ve received a `k` press while a `j` press is still queued

<p><span>A message from the editors:</span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, real-time ray tracing arrived in consumer GPU hardware and swiftly established itself as a key component of how images would be generated moving forward. Now, three years later, the second iteration of this hardware is available, mainstream game consoles support ray tracing, and cross-platform API standards have been established to drive even wider adoption. Developers and researchers have been busy inventing (and reinventing) algorithms to take advantage of the new possibilities created by these advancements. The “gems” of knowledge discovered during this process are what you will find in </span><i><span>Ray Tracing Gems II</span></i><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Writing an anthology style book, such as this, is an act of collective faith. Faith that the authors, editors, publisher, and schedules all converge to produce a worthwhile result for readers. Under normal circumstances this is a difficult task, but the past year and a half has been anything but “normal”. This book’s call for participation was posted in late November 2019, just as the COVID-19 virus began to emerge in Asia. In the 18 months since, a once-in-a-century pandemic has surged. Its impact has touched every person on Earth – and it is not yet over. The virus has taken lives, battered livelihoods, and broken the way of life as we knew it. We postponed this book with the quiet conviction that the coronavirus would be overcome. As time passed, the development of vaccines made breakneck progress, remote work in quarantine became a new staple of life, and authors began to write about computer graphics again. As a result, this book was written entirely during quarantine. We sincerely thank the authors for their passion and dedication – and faith – all of which made this book possible under extraordinary circumstances.</span></p>

      <title>I’m an ICU Doctor and I Can&#39;t Believe What Unvaccinated Patients Are Saying</title>
      <link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/icu-doctor-health-care-workers-unvaccinated-patients_n_6102ad2ae4b000b997df1f17</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-yaft-module="huffpost-entry-text">
<p>“We can’t let COVID win.”</p>
<p>This was my colleague’s mantra when the pandemic started last year. And for the almost 18 months since, health care workers have rallied to the battlefields, even at times when we had no weapons to brandish.</p>
<p>We took care of the infected and the critically ill when no one else would. We reused N95 masks, carefully placing them in labeled brown paper bags in between shifts. We witnessed lonely deaths and held up iPads for families to say their heartbreaking goodbyes. We created elaborate backup schedules and neglected our personal lives. We stepped up during surges and when our colleagues fell ill. Camaraderie in the ICU had never been stronger because we recognized that this was a team effort and all of humanity was battling against a common enemy.</p>
<p>But as health care workers, we also were painfully aware of our own vulnerabilities. We can run out of ICU resources for our patients. We can run out of personal protective equipment for ourselves. We can be exposed on the job and get sick. And we can die — many of us did, <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/us-health-workers-deaths-covid-lost-on-the-frontline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 3,600 from COVID-19 in the first year</a>.</p>
<p>Many of us quarantined away from our families to protect the ones we love. We counted the risk factors of our children, our elderly parents, our spouses, and came up with our own formulas to decide whether to come home at the end of the shift or hole up in a hotel room. One of our ICU directors wrote and rewrote our COVID-19 clinical guidelines to keep up with the evolving literature and somehow she carved out the time to write her own will.</p>

<figure>


</figure>

<p>I worked daily to adapt our end-of-life program to the changing needs and restrictions of the pandemic and signed up for a vaccine clinical trial as soon as one became available. I also updated my own advance directive and printed it out for my husband, just in case.</p>
<p>Then, effective vaccines became widely available in the U.S. — I briefly saw light at the end of the tunnel. The number of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs across the country plummeted. It looked like our sacrifices and commitment as health care workers had paid off. We believed herd immunity could become a reality and we could return to some sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>But the relief was short-lived, the hope was fleeting, and we are amid another surge. A surge that is fueled by a highly transmissible variant and those unvaccinated. My experiences in the ICU these past weeks have left me surprised, disheartened, but most of all, angry.</p>
<p>I am angry that the tragic scenes of prior surges are being played out yet again, but now with ICUs primarily filled with patients who have chosen not to be vaccinated. I am angry that it takes me over an hour to explain to an anti-vaxxer full of misinformation that intubation isn’t what “kills patients” and that their wish for chest compressions without intubation in the event of a respiratory arrest makes no sense. I am angry at those who refuse to wear “muzzles” when grocery shopping for half an hour a week, as I have been so-called “muzzled” for much of the past 18 months.</p>
<p>I cannot understand the simultaneous decision to not get vaccinated and the demand to end the restrictions imposed by a pandemic. I cannot help but recoil as if I’ve been slapped in the face when my ICU patient tells me they didn’t get vaccinated because they “just didn’t get around to it.” Although such individuals do not consider themselves anti-vaxxers, their inaction itself is a decision — a decision to not protect themselves or their families, to fill a precious ICU bed, to let new variants flourish, and to endanger the health care workers and immunosuppressed people around them. Their inaction is a decision to let this pandemic continue to rage.</p>
<blockquote>
<span>I am at a loss to understand how anyone can look at these past months of the pandemic — more than 600,000 lives lost in the U.S. and more than 4 million worldwide — and not believe it’s real or take it seriously.</span>
</blockquote>

<p><span>And meanwhile, immunocompromised people, for whom vaccines don’t generate much immunity, are desperately waiting for herd immunity. I have no way to comfort my rightfully outraged transplant patients who contracted COVID-19 after isolating for over a year and getting fully vaccinated as soon as they could. With angry tears, these patients tell me it’s not fair that there are people who are choosing to endanger both themselves and the vulnerable people around them. They feel betrayed by their fellow citizens and they are bitter and angry. I cannot blame them.  </span></p>
<p><span>I am at a loss to understand how anyone can look at these past months of the pandemic — more than 600,000 lives lost in the U.S. and more than 4 million worldwide — and not believe it’s real or take it seriously. But the unhappy truth is that there are people who do not. They did not in the beginning and many are doubling down now. </span></p>
<p><span>I thought when this pandemic began that we were all in this fight together, engaged in a war against a common enemy. Now, I painfully realize: Perhaps we were never on the same side and we never had a common enemy. Perhaps the war has been among ourselves all along. We have won many battles but unvaccinated America is choosing to let COVID win the war. </span></p>

      <title>Parsing Excel XLSX Using Tcl Parser Tools (2011)</title>

<p><a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/JBR">jbr</a> - 2011/02/14 (Happy Valentines Day)</p><p>Here is some code I&#39;ve written to parse and evaluate formula in an Excel 2008 xml format spreadsheet. I generate some very complex reports in Excel format using perl (XLSX:Excel:Writer <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Using+Perl+to+get+Excel">Using Perl to get Excel</a>), so my xlsx output files do not have the values precomputed for each cell the way excel writes its output by default. To allow testing and verification of values that I&#39;m pushing out to the client I need to be able to evaluate the formula that I&#39;ve written. This is a rather long story but it starts with an example of using the Tcl <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Parser+Tools">Parser Tools</a> from tcllib 1.13:</p><p>xls-parser.peg:</p><div><pre id="mkup_code_0"> PEG xlsexpr (Formula)

Its almost 500 lines so I&#39;ll just reference it here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/jbroll/xlsx-expr">https://github.com/jbroll/xlsx-expr <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p><p>Included are methods to open the xlsx file and parse the cell values, formula and formats from the xml into instance variable arrays in the xlsx object. The &#34;=&#34; method evaluates the value of the cell including following a formula right through all the references in the spreadsheet. Each formula value is cached and evaluated only once. Formula are evaluated by parsing them into AST format with parser tools and then executing the AST as a script. The result of the script is an expression suitable for <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/expr">expr</a>, which is then called to obtain the cell&#39;s value. Just enough stuff is implemented here to support the syntax and functions in my spreadsheets, but extending this should be straight forward. I have evaluated workbooks with multiple worksheets, complex formula across thousands of cells with perfect agreement to the values that excel computes itself.</p><p>These Excel functions are currently supported:</p><ul><li>MAX</li><li>MIN</li><li>COUNT</li><li>SUM</li><li>AND</li><li>DAYS360</li><li>VLOOKUP</li><li>IF - This is handled specially in the AST expansion to short circuit. </li><li>YEAR</li><li>ROUND</li></ul><p>The parser is fed using tcl::chan::string which needs a small patch. The Allowance method is broken so I just added a &#34;return&#34; at the start of virtchannel_core/events.tcl:Allowance to disable any checking. This checking seemed like overkill to me anyway.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/AK">AK</a>: The checking is necessary. My 2009 Conference paper on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tclcommunityassociation.org/wub/proceedings/Proceedings-2009/proceedings/TclChannels/rtc.pdf">Reflecting and Transforming Channels <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> (at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tclcommunityassociation.org/wub/proceedings/Proceedings-2009.html">TCA Conference Page <span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>) explains these internals. The actual issue was a missing constructor chaining preventing the proper initialization of the event management core. Fixed in the source repository head.</p>

      <title>Growing open source from Torch to PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://soumith.ch/posts/2021/02/growing-opensource/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>from Torch to PyTorch</h2><p>An outline of my keynote talk at JuliaCon.</p><p><strong>August 2, 2021</strong></p></div><div><article><blockquote><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I didn’t cover some of this talk outline at JuliaCon and improvised on other parts, so the video doesn’t match or cover everything written here.</em></p></blockquote><p>As I’ve been told, the Julia community invites keynotes from people from adjacent open-source communities to learn from them. So, in my keynote, I tried to give a small thread of my journey through Torch and PyTorch.</p><p id="6V6jk_OdH-w"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6V6jk_OdH-w" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Most open-source projects don’t just get started with <em>“we need to have 10k users”</em>. That just doesn’t make sense, and the journey through open-source is a lot more organic.</p><p>What we start with – especially in open-source – is to do something that’s of personal interest. Often, we try to intersect it with something that is of broader interest or need. The market-making here a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ideas and project mostly grow organically only if they are of interest to many people who want to commit time together. There are rare exceptions, like a mega-corp launching a top-down product with a huge marketing plan, but that’s not really what I want to talk about here.</p><p>Most small open-source projects, after enough effort and involvement, think about growth. At that point, they’ve nailed down their core interests and philosophies which are a foundation for their technical and cultural stack. Next, they’re wondering if they are doing the best they can to sell, market and grow this project.</p><p>In this note, I talk about four aspects that are useful to delibrately outline as you grow from this stage of a project. I talk through these aspects via stories from my journey from Torch to PyTorch:</p><ul><li>Philosophy / Principles</li><li>Scope &amp; Risk</li><li>Measurement</li><li>Scaling of the project</li></ul><h2>Philosophy / Principles</h2><p>When we think about a project, it could be a technology-centric project, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tensor Comprehensions</a> which was trying to propagate the ideas of polyhederal optimization, or a user-centric project like <a href="http://torch.ch/">Torch-7</a>, which propagates the ideas of ease-of-use without caring about what technology or ideas get you the ease of use.</p><p>I started working with Torch in 2010/2011. Over time, I made friends in the Torch community, I understood the implicit principles that they stood for as a whole. Open-source, like politics, can be fairly ill-defined in relationships and principles – not everyone stands for the same thing.</p><p>So, over the years, I absorbed and appreciated that Torch was a user-centric product, which stood for immediate-mode, easy-to-debug, stay-out-of-the-way explicitness. It was targeted at people somewhat familiar with programming matters, and who could reason about things like performance, and if needed, write a C function and bind it in quickly.</p><p>When we were writing PyTorch, I came to the realization that in an organic open-source community, not everyone stands for the same principles. We had a couple of really important members in the Torch community who were against Python, even though our user-centric view allowed us to go in that direction. Then, we had to make a decision on bringing them along or leaving them behind. These are difficult decisions because there is no right answer, only subjective calls that you have to make rapidly as a leader.</p><p>In such scenarios, it is often worth thinking about when to stay strong, and when to compromise. My view is that you have to be absolutely stubborn on the principles / philosophy that you are driving, but everything else is changeable.</p><p>This view was really useful in bringing people along. Over time, PyTorch brought along and integrated the Caffe2 community and the Chainer community and stayed friendly with Jax and Swift4TF since their inception. Bringing others along has huge advantages. The community gets bigger, you arguably get wider perspectives that make the project better and broader over time. And if you are stubborn on your core principles, you aren’t really compromising on your original vision, only strictly making it better.</p><h2>Scope &amp; Risk</h2><p>Apart from the challenge of bringing the Torch community along, the second thing we were facing was that our most formidable competitor at that time – TensorFlow rumoured to have 10x to 30x more developers. The really good thing for us though, was that TensorFlow was trying to be everything for everyone. From our visibility, it was a project planned top-down with a huge amount of resources and breadth.</p><p>So, we naturally tried to take the exact opposite approach, mostly to survive and compete on realistic terms. We decided that we would concentrate on no one except ML researchers, and make their life really good. This way, we can stay focused and deliver with lesser resources. We intentionally scoped down and hence took more vertical risk, but less horizontal risk. We just wanted to nail our addressable market.</p><p>However, once we were successful in that market with PyTorch, we got incrementally amibitious. We slowly and incrementally expanded our scope and ambition, as we grew and matured. This approached scaled well.</p><p>Here, I also want to talk about the deliberate nature of risks you take and how it could shape your destiny.</p><p>We were making a deliberate bet on the ML researcher market, and that:</p><ul><li>the modeling they do over the next few years would need more flexibilty and debuggability</li><li>the ML researcher market would continue innovating on crazier model architectures and that it would become the mainstream future</li></ul><p>So, with this bet, we needed a very wide API combined with a user-experience that helped use and extend that API really easily. This bet we made could have not worked out for a million reasons based on how the ML community shaped it’s future. For example we could’ve hypothetically stopped innovating at ResNets for maybe a decade, and that would’ve made the need for a wide and large API obsolete – and that future would’ve needed a library more vertically focused only ResNets.</p><p>You can listen to more of my views of this topic, and how I think about the future ML frameworks, <a href="https://scale.com/events/transform/videos/future-of-ml-frameworks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this talk that I gave</a>.</p><h2>Measurement / Metrics</h2><p>Apart from our core principles and scope, we also wanted a feedback loop with our customers, which is a standard operating need in product development. Then, we asked ourself about how we want to track various dimensions of PyTorch:</p><ul><li>Are they measurable</li><li>Are they measuarable well?</li><li>Should you measure them?</li><li>How do you deal with unmeasurable areas? – at scale?</li></ul><p>In our Torch days, we learned a lot about how people love to measure things, and how other love to read comparisons of measurement as gospel. For example, micro-benchmarks, github stars growth, tables of feature comparison, etc. etc.</p><p>After people published a few such measurements and comparisons in the community, we felt wronged by some of these measurements, and we were annoyed by them. But the bigger realization we took out of our experiences from Torch was to ask ourselves how prematurely measuring something shapes the product in a bad way. Even though we didn’t write the blogposts measuring Torch to a competitor, we were constantly expending significant energy trying to optimize for those measurements and reacting to them, instead of focusing on other more user-important priorities.</p><p>So, when we wrote PyTorch, we were clear on two things. One, that our core competency is not something measurable like speed or some other stat, but we needed to march towards a buttery-smooth user-experience that put flexibility, API design and debuggability as a top priority. There is no good way to measure that, and we had to get really comfortable with that ambiguousness, and to be able to subjectively constantly reassess our internal signals on whether we are able to do a good job or not. Second, we believed that if we don’t react to external measurments of PyTorch, we can stay focused on what we care about – even if that creates short-term churn.</p><p>So, in PyTorch’s history, we never responded to speed benchmarks or irrelevant measures such as github stars. We haven’t submitted to industry benchmarks such as MLPerf ourself as the PyTorch authors. It was very deliberate, and we are really really comfortable and happy with our approach. When I would give PyTorch talks, it would be common for someone to ask: “how fast are you compared to X?”. Even if I knew we were as fast or faster on a given use-case, I would simply side-step the question – “we are more flexible, and we are probably within 10% of the performance elsewhere, try us out”. This gave us an incredible superpower – to focus on our core competency without the pressure of getting dragged into what we saw as a reductive view of our product – a view where our superiority is not valued at all.</p><p>The metrics that we softly tried to rely on were whether people were using PyTorch and it’s relative use to our competition. Not metrics that measured bookmarking (like github stars), or performance on microbenchmarks – but actually writing code in it. So, we used metrics like Github’s global code search (for <code>import torch</code> and stuff) and arxiv citations, which more accurately portrayed whether someone actually used us, with no ambiguity.</p><p>However, the problem was that these are lagging metrics. We couldn’t rely on them to understand immediate needs of our community at all, because they had a huge lead-time, 6 months or so.</p><p>We also didn’t use metrics to try to approximate how users felt about their overall experience, and aspects such as debuggability and API ease. But we did subjectively measure them…</p><p>At a smaller scale, what we did was for me to basically read the entire volume of information that our community produced – github issues, forum posts, slack messages, twitter posts, reddit and hackernews comments. It was incredibly useful signal – yes there was a lot of noise but there was a lot of signal as well. It helped us prioritize really well, and I think it was a great way to shape our product through subjective land. Apart from me, almost all the core devs spent a lot of time interacting with our users, and so we had a rich amount of shared understanding through very ambiguous and subjective aspects. However, this approach did not scale beyond a point.</p><h2>Scaling</h2><p>As we scaled, I think within 2 years of PyTorch, I was getting to physical / human limits of doing this every day. I was going through ~500 github notifications, ~50+ forum posts, tons of slack activity and many engagements on twitter/Reddit/HN. I think I was working 15 hour days and was just exhausted all the time without actually doing much else. My immediate thought was to obviously pawn this off on someone else, i.e. they work harder and better, and I can nurse my burnout.</p><p>This was obviously not going to work. My colleague Edward Yang who has superpowers that I don’t have, he took over the process with the intent of first observing it, and then building a better process to scale it. He wrote a fantastic blog post summarizing what he did <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2021/01/pytorch-open-source-process/">here</a>. The nice realization that I came to from watching him do this is that once you’re at a certain scale, you can’t aim to do everything and you have to heavily heavily prioritize and there’s no other way around it and that’s okay. It doesn’t make you cruel for not being able to close every github issue.</p><p>The other thing to think about at scale is whether you integrate vertically or horizontally. In 2009, AMD spun off their fab division into a separate company. At that time, I found this incredibly hard to comprehend. Several years later, I read an article that theorized that AMD did this because the fab (backend) wasn’t working well with the designers (frontend), and that the vertical integration there was hurting more than helping. In contrast, Apple’s M1 processor and it’s magically fast practical speeds are attributed to unbelievably good vertical scaling, where the software team is able to measure the bottlenecks in the Apple software ecosystem, and find critical low-level ops that need to be sped up, and that signal translating all the way until hardware design. I don’t know if either of these theories are true, but I do believe that vertical integration done poorly is a huge overhead and done well is a huge force multiplier – so choose wisely which way you go. On PyTorch, we vertically integrated packages like <code>distributed</code>, <code>jit</code> and <code>quantization</code>, which need deeper vertical integration because they intersect heavily with frontend design. We branched off packages such as <code>torchvision</code> or <code>torchserve</code> into their own github repos, because they didn’t need as much end-to-end thought. Here, I think the decisions around vertical vs horizontal integration also heavily rely on the effective bandwidth between the people building these things – whether they are within the same company, whether they are in the same timezone or physical space, or if they are primarily talking via long-form async communication – all defining whether the vertical integration can be effectively executed.</p><p>Another topic I wanted to talk about on scaling is on growing not just yourself but your ecosystem. The right kind of incentives matter – a lot. Since the beginning of PyTorch, we wanted to grow the community based on whether people were interested in using / contributing to PyTorch because they liked it as a product. We worked really hard to remove other kinds of incentives. Hence, for a very long time, we didn’t offer any prizes or bounties or other economic incentives to get people to use PyTorch. Our view was that once you introduce economic incentives, it shapes your community’s culture in an irreversible way. Even now, outside of a hackathon or two a year, we strive to not push this button much, even though we have a bigger budget as a project and we can. Another incentive we care about a lot is to make sure we give others the space to grow, and not scope-creep everything for ourselves. We care about helping the community grow and fill voids first, and only if no one is filling the needs do we deliberately go in and make those investments top-down.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p>My goal was to tell you a few anecdotes and stories from the journey of the PyTorch team, the project and from my personal journey. I hoped to tie them to four useful dimensions that you think about when building and growing an open-source project, whether in Julia land or elsewhere. I hope this was useful, and please email me if you have any feedback.</p></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                                <div><div><p>A Valley Village woman has sued the city of Los Angeles, saying she was struck by a car after venturing into a Hollywood street where a homeless encampment was blocking city sidewalks.</p><p>Debra Todd, 64, sustained injuries to her head, hip, back, arm and leg when she was hit by a Nissan heading south on Gower Street at the 101 Freeway overpass, according to the lawsuit filed earlier this week.</p><p>The incident occurred on Oct. 4, 2020, as  Todd was crossing Gower. Todd said she had gone to the overpass to distribute sandwiches, potato chips and water to people living at the freeway encampment.</p><p>“Because of the encampment, you couldn’t walk on the sidewalk. You had to walk on the street,” she said. “There was no light or stop sign anywhere at Gower where I got hit.”</p>

<p>Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for City Atty. Mike Feuer, declined to discuss the lawsuit’s allegations. “We will review the complaint and have no further comment at this time,” he said.</p><p>The legal filing comes just a few days after Mayor Eric Garcetti signed a <a href="https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-1376-S1_ord_draft_7-02-21.pdf" target="_blank">law</a> allowing the City Council to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-28/anti-camping-vote-la-homelessness" target="_blank">remove encampments</a> that pose a public safety threat or are within 500 feet of a freeway overpass. A council vote will be required before enforcement can begin at a particular location.</p><p>Under the ordinance, the city can also clear encampments that block wheelchair access, as required under the Americans With Disabilities Act — an action that would not require a council vote.</p>
<p>Backers of the ordinance have portrayed it as humane, saying any enforcement would be accompanied by street engagement teams offering shelter and services. Foes say it would criminalize homelessness and spur the city to issue citations to those who are least capable of paying.</p><p>Todd, the lawsuit’s plaintiff, told The Times she had been attempting to get from one side of Gower to the other when she and another person, a homeless man with whom she was walking, were hit by the car. At the time, the median on Gower was also filled with tents, she said. </p>
<p>Todd was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, while the male victim declined medical treatment, according to a report prepared by the Los Angeles Police Department. The driver of the Nissan stayed on the scene and told authorities that she had been going 20 mph.</p>
<p>The car did not have visible damage on its front bumper area, the report said.</p><p>Todd’s lawsuit accuses the city of allowing the encampment at the 101 overpass on Gower to remain for a “substantial amount of time,” creating dangerous conditions for pedestrians and drivers. The city also did not post signs warning drivers that there would be “excessive foot traffic” in the street due to the encampments, the lawsuit said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the sidewalks and median at the  overpass were still filled with tents, furniture and other objects.</p><p>Alan Turlington, Todd’s lawyer, said his client suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, which could leave her with a permanent disability and require future medical treatment. Todd expects to lose earning capacity as a result of that injury, he said.</p>
<p>The issue of homeless encampments at freeway overpasses has come up previously as part of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-10-23/judge-efforts-bolster-complicate-homeless-housing" target="_blank">federal civil rights lawsuit</a> filed by a group of downtown residents and business owners who say the city and county have failed to address the region’s homelessness crisis.</p>
<p>At one point last year, a federal judge issued a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.775720/gov.uscourts.cacd.775720.108.0.pdf" target="_blank">preliminary injunction</a> ordering the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-05-20/city-and-county-fight-over-how-to-shelter-homeless-coronavirus" target="_blank">city and county</a> to move homeless people away from freeways, arguing that they were being exposed to health hazards caused by vehicle emissions.</p><p>In response, the city and county reached an agreement to create <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-06-18/city-and-county-agree-to-provide-6000-new-beds-of-shelter-for-homeless-people-in-next-18-months" target="_blank">more than 6,000</a> new beds, which have been opening at a steady pace over the last year. The judge later withdrew the order.</p>
<p>With the city’s new anti-camping ordinance taking effect next month, some council members have already indicated they intend to renew their focus on areas around freeways. </p><p>Councilman Curren Price, who represents a portion of South Los Angeles, said he intends to introduce resolutions targeting streets that intersect with the 110 Freeway, which runs the length of his district. </p><p>“We definitely want to target that area from Washington [Boulevard] all the way down to Manchester [Avenue],” he said.</p></div></div>

      <title>China Says It&#39;s Closing in on Thorium Nuclear Reactor</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-closing-in-on-thorium-nuclear-reactor</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><template>
                    <p>
	Looking to such specialized nervous systems as a model for artificial intelligence may prove just as valuable, if not more so, than studying the human brain. Consider the brains of those ants in your pantry. Each has some 250,000 neurons. Larger insects have closer to 1 million. In my research at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, I study the brains of one of these larger insects, the dragonfly. I and my colleagues at Sandia, a national-security laboratory, hope to take advantage of these insects&#39; specializations to design computing systems optimized for tasks like intercepting an incoming missile or following an odor plume. By harnessing the speed, simplicity, and efficiency of the dragonfly nervous system, we aim to design computers that perform these functions faster and at a fraction of the power that conventional systems consume.
</p><p>
<strong>Looking to a dragonfly</strong> as a harbinger of future computer systems may seem counterintuitive. The developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning that make news are typically algorithms that mimic human intelligence or even surpass people&#39;s abilities. Neural networks can already perform as well—if not better—than people at some specific tasks, such as detecting cancer in medical scans. And the potential of these neural networks stretches far beyond visual processing. The computer program<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/deepmind-achieves-holy-grail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>AlphaZero</u></a>, trained by self-play, is the best Go player in the world. Its sibling AI,<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/deepminds-ai-shows-itself-to-be-a-worldbeating-world-builder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>AlphaStar</u></a>, ranks among the best<em> Starcraft II </em>players.
</p><p>
	Such feats, however, come at a cost. Developing these sophisticated systems requires massive amounts of processing power, generally available only to select institutions with the fastest supercomputers and the resources to support them. And the energy cost is off-putting.
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>Recent estimates</u></a> suggest that the carbon emissions resulting from developing and training a natural-language processing algorithm are greater than those produced by four cars over their lifetimes.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">It takes the dragonfly only about 50 milliseconds to begin to respond to a prey&#39;s maneuver. If we assume 10 ms for cells in the eye to detect and transmit information about the prey, and another 5 ms for muscles to start producing force, this leaves only 35 ms for the neural circuitry to make its calculations. Given that it typically takes a single neuron at least 10 ms to integrate inputs, the underlying neural network can be at least three layers deep.</small>
</p><p>
	But does an artificial neural network really need to be large and complex to be useful? I believe it doesn&#39;t. To reap the benefits of neural-inspired computers in the near term, we must strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication.
</p><p>
	Which brings me back to the dragonfly, an animal with a brain that may provide precisely the right balance for certain applications.
</p><p>
	If you have ever encountered a dragonfly, you already know how fast these beautiful creatures can zoom, and you&#39;ve seen their incredible agility in the air. Maybe less obvious from casual observation is their excellent hunting ability: Dragonflies successfully capture up to 95 percent of the prey they pursue, eating hundreds of mosquitoes in a day.
</p><p>
	The physical prowess of the dragonfly has certainly not gone unnoticed. For decades, U.S. agencies have experimented with using dragonfly-inspired designs for surveillance drones. Now it is time to turn our attention to the brain that controls this tiny hunting machine.
</p><p>
<strong>While dragonflies</strong> may not be able to play strategic games like Go, a dragonfly does demonstrate a form of strategy in the way it aims ahead of its prey&#39;s current location to intercept its dinner. This takes calculations performed extremely fast—it typically takes a dragonfly just 50 milliseconds to start turning in response to a prey&#39;s maneuver. It does this while tracking the angle between its head and its body, so that it knows which wings to flap faster to turn ahead of the prey. And it also tracks its own movements, because as the dragonfly turns, the prey will also appear to move.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The model dragonfly reorients in response to the prey&#39;s turning. The smaller black circle is the dragonfly&#39;s head, held at its initial position. The solid black line indicates the direction of the dragonfly&#39;s flight; the dotted blue lines are the plane of the model dragonfly&#39;s eye. The red star is the prey&#39;s position relative to the dragonfly, with the dotted red line indicating the dragonfly&#39;s line of sight.</small>
</p><p>
	So the dragonfly&#39;s brain is performing a remarkable feat, given that the time needed for a single neuron to add up all its inputs—called its membrane time constant—exceeds 10 milliseconds. If you factor in time for the eye to process visual information and for the muscles to produce the force needed to move, there&#39;s really only time for three, maybe four, layers of neurons, in sequence, to add up their inputs and pass on information
</p><p>
	Could I build a neural network that works like the dragonfly interception system? I also wondered about uses for such a neural-inspired interception system. Being at Sandia, I immediately considered defense applications, such as missile defense, imagining missiles of the future with onboard systems designed to rapidly calculate interception trajectories without affecting a missile&#39;s weight or power consumption. But there are civilian applications as well.
</p><p>
	For example, the algorithms that control self-driving cars might be made more efficient, no longer requiring a trunkful of computing equipment. If a dragonfly-inspired system can perform the calculations to plot an interception trajectory, perhaps autonomous drones could use it to 
	<em>avoid</em> collisions. And if a computer could be made the same size as a dragonfly brain (about 6 cubic millimeters), perhaps insect repellent and mosquito netting will one day become a thing of the past, replaced by tiny insect-zapping drones!
</p><p>
<strong>To begin to answer</strong> these questions, I created a simple neural network to stand in for the dragonfly&#39;s nervous system and used it to calculate the turns that a dragonfly makes to capture prey. My three-layer neural network exists as a software simulation. Initially, I worked in Matlab simply because that was the coding environment I was already using. I have since ported the model to Python.
</p><p>
	Because dragonflies have to see their prey to capture it, I started by simulating a simplified version of the dragonfly&#39;s eyes, capturing the minimum detail required for tracking prey. Although dragonflies have two eyes, it&#39;s generally accepted that they do not use stereoscopic depth perception to estimate distance to their prey. In my model, I did not model both eyes. Nor did I try to match the resolution of
	<a href="https://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_insects/DragonflyHead.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>a</u></a><u> dragonfly eye</u>. Instead, the first layer of the neural network includes 441 neurons that represent input from the eyes, each describing a specific region of the visual field—these regions are tiled to form a 21-by-21-neuron array that covers the dragonfly&#39;s field of view. As the dragonfly turns, the location of the prey&#39;s image in the dragonfly&#39;s field of view changes. The dragonfly calculates turns required to align the prey&#39;s image with one (or a few, if the prey is large enough) of these &#34;eye&#34; neurons. A second set of 441 neurons, also in the first layer of the network, tells the dragonfly which eye neurons should be aligned with the prey&#39;s image, that is, where the prey should be within its field of view.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The model dragonfly engages its prey.</small>
</p><p>
	Processing—the calculations that take input describing the movement of an object across the field of vision and turn it into instructions about which direction the dragonfly needs to turn—happens between the first and third layers of my artificial neural network. In this second layer, I used an array of 194,481 (21<sup>4</sup>) neurons, likely much larger than the number of neurons used by a dragonfly for this task. I precalculated the weights of the connections between all the neurons into the network. While these weights could be learned with enough time, there is an advantage to &#34;learning&#34; through evolution and preprogrammed neural network architectures. Once it comes out of its nymph stage as a winged adult (technically referred to as a teneral), the dragonfly does not have a parent to feed it or show it how to hunt. The dragonfly is in a vulnerable state and getting used to a new body—it would be disadvantageous to have to figure out a hunting strategy at the same time. I set the weights of the network to allow the model dragonfly to calculate the correct turns to intercept its prey from incoming visual information. What turns are those? Well, if a dragonfly wants to catch a mosquito that&#39;s crossing its path, it can&#39;t just aim at the mosquito. To borrow from what hockey player Wayne Gretsky once said about pucks, the dragonfly has to aim for where the mosquito is going to be. You might think that following Gretsky&#39;s advice would require a complex algorithm, but in fact the strategy is quite simple: All the dragonfly needs to do is to maintain a constant angle between its line of sight with its lunch and a fixed reference direction.
</p><p>
	Readers who have any experience piloting boats will understand why that is. They know to get worried when the angle between the line of sight to another boat and a reference direction (for example due north) remains constant, because they are on a collision course. Mariners have long avoided steering such a course, known as parallel navigation, to avoid collisions
</p><p>
	Translated to dragonflies, which 
	<em>want</em> to collide with their prey, the prescription is simple: keep the line of sight to your prey constant relative to some external reference. However, this task is not necessarily trivial for a dragonfly as it swoops and turns, collecting its meals. The dragonfly does not have an internal gyroscope (that we know of) that will maintain a constant orientation and provide a reference regardless of how the dragonfly turns. Nor does it have a magnetic compass that will always point north. In my simplified simulation of dragonfly hunting, the dragonfly turns to align the prey&#39;s image with a specific location on its eye, but it needs to calculate what that location should be.
</p><p>
	The third and final layer of my simulated neural network is the motor-command layer. The outputs of the neurons in this layer are high-level instructions for the dragonfly&#39;s muscles, telling the dragonfly in which direction to turn. The dragonfly also uses the output of this layer to predict the effect of its own maneuvers on the location of the prey&#39;s image in its field of view and updates that projected location accordingly. This updating allows the dragonfly to hold the line of sight to its prey steady, relative to the external world, as it approaches.
</p><p>
	It is possible that biological dragonflies have evolved additional tools to help with the calculations needed for this prediction. For example, dragonflies have specialized sensors that measure body rotations during flight as well as head rotations relative to the body—if these sensors are fast enough, the dragonfly could calculate the effect of its movements on the prey&#39;s image directly from the sensor outputs or use one method to cross-check the other. I did not consider this possibility in my simulation.
</p><p>
	To test this three-layer neural network, I simulated a dragonfly and its prey, moving at the same speed through three-dimensional space. As they do so my modeled neural-network brain &#34;sees&#34; the prey, calculates where to point to keep the image of the prey at a constant angle, and sends the appropriate instructions to the muscles. I was able to show that this simple model of a dragonfly&#39;s brain can indeed successfully intercept other bugs, even prey traveling along curved or semi-random trajectories. The simulated dragonfly does not quite achieve the success rate of the biological dragonfly, but it also does not have all the advantages (for example, impressive flying speed) for which dragonflies are known.
</p><p>
<strong>More work is needed </strong>to determine whether this neural network is really incorporating all the secrets of the dragonfly&#39;s brain. Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute&#39;s Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, have developed tiny backpacks for dragonflies that can measure electrical signals from a dragonfly&#39;s nervous system while it is in flight and transmit these data for analysis. The backpacks are small enough not to distract the dragonfly from the hunt. Similarly, neuroscientists can also record signals from individual neurons in the dragonfly&#39;s brain while the insect is held motionless but made to think it&#39;s moving by presenting it with the appropriate visual cues, creating a dragonfly-scale virtual reality.
</p><p>
	Data from these systems allows neuroscientists to validate dragonfly-brain models by comparing their activity with activity patterns of biological neurons in an active dragonfly. While we cannot yet directly measure individual connections between neurons in the dragonfly brain, I and my collaborators will be able to infer whether the dragonfly&#39;s nervous system is making calculations similar to those predicted by my artificial neural network. That will help determine whether connections in the dragonfly brain resemble my precalculated weights in the neural network. We will inevitably find ways in which our model differs from the actual dragonfly brain. Perhaps these differences will provide clues to the shortcuts that the dragonfly brain takes to speed up its calculations.
</p><p>

<small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This backpack that captures signals from electrodes inserted in a dragonfly&#39;s brain was created by Anthony Leonardo, a group leader at Janelia Research Campus.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Anthony Leonardo/Janelia Research Campus/HHMI</small>
</p><p>
<strong>Dragonflies could also teach us</strong> how to implement &#34;attention&#34; on a computer. You likely know what it feels like when your brain is at full attention, completely in the zone, focused on one task to the point that other distractions seem to fade away. A dragonfly can likewise focus its attention. Its nervous system turns up the volume on responses to particular, presumably selected, targets, even when other potential prey are visible in the same field of view. It makes sense that once a dragonfly has decided to pursue a particular prey, it should change targets only if it has failed to capture its first choice. (In other words, using parallel navigation to catch a meal is not useful if you are easily distracted.)
</p><p>
	Even if we end up discovering that the dragonfly mechanisms for directing attention are less sophisticated than those people use to focus in the middle of a crowded coffee shop, it&#39;s possible that a simpler but lower-power mechanism will prove advantageous for next-generation algorithms and computer systems by offering efficient ways to discard irrelevant inputs
</p><p>
	The advantages of studying the dragonfly brain do not end with new algorithms; they also can affect systems design. Dragonfly eyes are fast, operating at the equivalent of 200 frames per second: That&#39;s several times the speed of human vision. But their spatial resolution is relatively poor, perhaps just a hundredth of that of the human eye. Understanding how the dragonfly hunts so effectively, despite its limited sensing abilities, can suggest ways of designing more efficient systems. Using the missile-defense problem, the dragonfly example suggests that our antimissile systems with fast optical sensing could require less spatial resolution to hit a target.
</p><p>
<strong>The dragonfly isn&#39;t the only insect</strong> that could inform neural-inspired computer design today. Monarch butterflies migrate incredibly long distances, using some innate instinct to begin their journeys at the appropriate time of year and to head in the right direction. We know that monarchs rely on the position of the sun, but navigating by the sun requires keeping track of the time of day. If you are a butterfly heading south, you would want the sun on your left in the morning but on your right in the afternoon. So, to set its course, the butterfly brain must therefore read its own circadian rhythm and combine that information with what it is observing.
</p><p>
	Other insects, like the Sahara desert ant, must forage for relatively long distances. Once a source of sustenance is found, this ant does not simply retrace its steps back to the nest, likely a circuitous path. Instead it calculates a direct route back. Because the location of an ant&#39;s food source changes from day to day, it must be able to remember the path it took on its foraging journey, combining visual information with some internal measure of distance traveled, and then
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Desert-Navigator-Journey-R%C3%BCdiger-Wehner/dp/0674045882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>calculate its return route</u></a> from those memories.
</p><p>
	While nobody knows what neural circuits in the desert ant perform this task, researchers at the Janelia Research Campus have identified neural circuits that allow the fruit fly to
	<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14446" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>self-orient using visual landmarks</u></a>. The desert ant and monarch butterfly likely use similar mechanisms. Such neural circuits might one day prove useful in, say, low-power drones.
</p><p>
	And what if the efficiency of insect-inspired computation is such that millions of instances of these specialized components can be run in parallel to support more powerful data processing or machine learning? Could the next AlphaZero incorporate millions of antlike foraging architectures to refine its game playing? Perhaps insects will inspire a new generation of computers that look very different from what we have today. A small army of dragonfly-interception-like algorithms could be used to control moving pieces of an amusement park ride, ensuring that individual cars do not collide (much like pilots steering their boats) even in the midst of a complicated but thrilling dance.
</p><p>
	No one knows what the next generation of computers will look like, whether they will be part-cyborg companions or centralized resources much like Isaac Asimov&#39;s Multivac. Likewise, no one can tell what the best path to developing these platforms will entail. While researchers developed early neural networks drawing inspiration from the human brain, today&#39;s artificial neural networks often rely on decidedly unbrainlike calculations. Studying the calculations of individual neurons in biological neural circuits—currently only directly possible in nonhuman systems—may have more to teach us. Insects, apparently simple but often astonishing in what they can do, have much to contribute to the development of next-generation computers, especially as neuroscience research continues to drive toward a deeper understanding of how biological neural circuits work.

	So next time you see an insect doing something clever, imagine the impact on your everyday life if you could have the brilliant efficiency of a small army of tiny dragonfly, butterfly, or ant brains at your disposal. Maybe computers of the future will give new meaning to the term &#34;hive mind,&#34; with swarms of highly specialized but extremely efficient minuscule processors, able to be reconfigured and deployed depending on the task at hand. With the advances being made in neuroscience today, this seeming fantasy may be closer to reality than you think.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Convolutional neural networks are very important in machine learning. If you want to do computer vision or image recognition tasks, you simply can’t go without them. But it can be hard to understand how they work.</p>
<p>In this post, we will talk about the mechanisms behind convolutional neural networks, their benefits, and business use cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-neural-network%3F"><p>What is a neural network?</p></h2>
<p>First, let’s brush up our knowledge about how neural networks work in general.</p>
<p>Any neural network, from simple perceptrons to enormous corporate AI-systems, consists of nodes that imitate the neurons in the human brain. These cells are tightly interconnected. So are the nodes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Neurons are usually organized into independent layers. One example of neural networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network">feed-forward networks</a>. The data moves from the input layer through a set of hidden layers only in one direction like water through filters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Every node in the system is connected to some nodes in the previous layer and in the next layer. The node receives information from the layer beneath it, does something with it, and sends information to the next layer.</p>
<p>Every incoming connection is assigned a weight. It’s a number that the node multiples the input by when it receives data from a different node.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are usually several incoming values that the node is working with. Then, it sums up everything together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are several possible ways to decide whether the input should be passed to the next layer. For example, if you use the unit step function, the node passes no data to the next layer if its value is below a threshold value. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node sends the number forward. However, in other cases, the neuron can simply project the input into some fixed value segment.</p>
<p>When a neural net is being trained for the first time, all of its weights and thresholds are assigned at random. Once the training data is fed to the input layer, it goes through all the layers and finally arrives at the output. During training, the weights and thresholds are adjusted until training data with the same labels consistently provides similar outputs. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backpropagation">backpropagation</a>. You can see how it works in <a href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&amp;batchSize=10&amp;dataset=circle&amp;regDataset=reg-plane&amp;learningRate=0.03&amp;regularizationRate=0&amp;noise=0&amp;networkShape=4,2&amp;seed=0.69808&amp;showTestData=false&amp;discretize=false&amp;percTrainData=50&amp;x=true&amp;y=true&amp;xTimesY=false&amp;xSquared=false&amp;ySquared=false&amp;cosX=false&amp;sinX=false&amp;cosY=false&amp;sinY=false&amp;collectStats=false&amp;problem=classification&amp;initZero=false&amp;hideText=false">TensorFlow Playground</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about neural networks in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide">introductory deep learning article</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-the-problem-with-simple-nns%3F"><p>What’s the problem with simple NNs?</p></h3>
<p>Regular artificial neural networks do not scale very well. For example, in CIFAR, a dataset that is commonly used for training computer vision models, the images are only of size 32x32 px and have 3 color channels. That means that a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of this neural network would have 32<em>32</em>3 = 3072 weights. It is still manageable. But now imagine a bigger image, for example, 300x300x3. It would have 270,000 weights (training of which demands so much computational power)!</p>
<p>A huge neural network like that demands a lot of resources but even then remains prone to overfitting because the large number of parameters enable it to just memorize the dataset.</p>
<p>CNNs use parameter sharing. All neurons in a particular feature map share weights which makes the whole system less computationally intense.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-cnn-work%3F"><p>How does a CNN work?</p></h2>
<p>A convolutional neural network, or ConvNet, is just a neural network that uses convolution. To understand the principle, we are going to work with a 2-dimensional convolution first.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-convolution%3F"><p>What is convolution?</p></h3>
<p>Convolution is a mathematical operation that allows the merging of two sets of information. In the case of CNN, convolution is applied to the input data to filter the information and produce a <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-visualize-filters-and-feature-maps-in-convolutional-neural-networks/">feature map</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This filter is also called a kernel, or feature detector, and its dimensions can be, for example, 3x3. To perform convolution, the kernel goes over the input image, doing matrix multiplication element after element. The result for each receptive field (the area where convolution takes place) is written down in the feature map.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We continue sliding the filter until the feature map is complete.</p>
<h3 id="padding-and-striding"><p>Padding and striding</p></h3>
<p>Before we go further, it’s also useful to talk about padding and striding. These techniques are often used in CNNs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Padding.</strong> Padding expands the input matrix  by adding fake pixels to the borders of the matrix. This is done because convolution reduces the size of the matrix. For example, a 5x5 matrix turns into a 3x3 matrix when a filter goes over it.</li>
<li><strong>Striding.</strong> It often happens that when working with a convolutional layer, you need to get an output that is smaller than the input. One way to achieve this is to use a pooling layer. Another way to achieve this is to use striding. The idea behind stride is to skip some areas when the kernel slides over: for example, skipping every 2 or 3 pixels.  It reduces spatial resolution and makes the network more computationally efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Padding and striding can help process images more accurately.</p>
<p>For a more detailed explanation of how CNNs work, watch this part of the machine learning course by Brandon Rohrer.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JB8T_zN7ZC0"></iframe>
<p>For real-life tasks, convolution is usually performed in 3D. The majority of images have 3 dimensions: height, width and depth, where depth corresponds to color channels (RGB). So the convolutional filter needs to be 3-dimensional as well. Here is how the same operation looks in 3D.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are multiple filters in a convolutional layer and each of them generates a filter map. Therefore, the output of a layer will be a set of filter maps, stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>For example, padding and passing a 30x30x3 matrix through 10 filters will result in a set of 10 30x30x1 matrices. After we stack these maps on top of each other, we will get a 30x30x10 matrix.</p>
<p>This is the output of our convolutional layer.</p>
<p>The process can be repeated: CNNs usually have more than one convolutional layer.</p>
<h3 id="3-layers-of-cnn"><p>3 layers of CNN</p></h3>
<p>The goal of CNN is to reduce the images so that it would be easier to process without losing features that are valuable for accurate prediction.</p>
<p>ConvNet architecture has three kinds of layers: convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully-connected layer.</p>
<ul>
<li>A convolutional layer is responsible for recognizing features in pixels.</li>
<li>A pooling layer is responsible for making these features more abstract.</li>
<li>A fully-connected layer is responsible for using the acquired features for prediction.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4 id="convolutional-layer"><p>Convolutional layer</p></h4>
<p>We’ve already described how convolution layers work <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks#how-does-a-cnn-work%3F">above</a>. They are at the center of CNNs, enabling them to autonomously recognize features in the images.</p>
<p>But going through the convolution process generates a large amount of data, which makes it hard to train the neural network. To compress the data, we need to go through pooling.</p>
<h4 id="pooling-layer"><p>Pooling layer</p></h4>
<p>A pooling layer receives the result from a convolutional layer and compresses it. The filter of a pooling layer is always smaller than a feature map. Usually, it takes a 2x2 square (patch) and compresses it into one value.</p>
<p>A 2x2 filter would reduce the number of pixels in each feature map to one quarter the size. If you had a feature map sized 10×10, the output map would be 5×5.</p>
<p>Multiple different functions can be used for pooling. These are the most frequent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum Pooling. It calculates the maximum value for each patch of the feature map.</li>
<li>Average pooling. It calculates the average value for each patch on the feature map.</li>
</ul>
<p>After using the pooling layer, you get pooled feature maps that are a summarized version of the features detected in the input. Pooling layer improves the stability of CNN: if before even slightest fluctuations in pixels would cause the model to misclassify, now small changes in the location of the feature in the input detected by the convolutional layer will result in a pooled feature map with the feature in the same location.</p>
<p>Now we need to flatten the input (turn it into a column vector) and pass it down to a regular neural network for classification.</p>
<h4 id="fully-connected-layer"><p>Fully-connected layer</p></h4>
<p>The flattened output is fed to a feed-forward neural network and backpropagation is applied at every iteration of training. This layer provides the model with the ability to finally understand images: there is a flow of information between each input pixel and each output class.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-convolutional-neural-networks"><p>Advantages of convolutional neural networks</p></h2>
<p>Convolutional neural networks have several benefits that make them useful for many different applications. If you want to see them in practice, watch this thorough explanation by StatQuest.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGwBXDKFk9I"></iframe>
<h3 id="feature-learning"><p>Feature learning</p></h3>
<p>CNNs don’t require manual feature engineering: they can grasp relevant features during training. Even if you’re working at a completely new task, you can use the pre-trained CNN and, by feeding it data, adjust the weights. CNN will tailor itself to a new task.</p>
<h3 id="computational-efficiency"><p>Computational efficiency</p></h3>
<p>CNN, due to the procedure of convolution, are much more computationally efficient than regular neural networks. CNN uses parameter sharing and dimensionality reduction, which makes models easy and quick to deploy. They can be optimised to run on any device, even on smartphones.</p>
<h3 id="high-accuracy"><p>High accuracy</p></h3>
<p>The current state-of-the-art NNs in image classification are not convolutional nets, for example, in image transformers. However, CNNs have now been dominating for a very long time in most cases and tasks regarding image and video recognition and similar tasks. They usually show <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/CNN-classification-v-s-Artificial-NN-classification-why-there-is-a-significant-difference-in-accuracy">higher accuracy</a> than non-convolutional NNs, especially when there is a lot of data involved.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-convnet"><p>Drawbacks of ConvNet</p></h2>
<p>However, ConvNet is not perfect. Even if it seems like a very intelligent tool, it’s still prone to adversarial attacks.</p>
<h3 id="adversarial-attacks"><p>Adversarial attacks</p></h3>
<p>Adversarial attacks are cases of feeding the network ‘bad’ examples (aka slightly modified in a particular way images) to cause misclassification. Even a slight shift in pixels can make a CNN go crazy. For example, criminals can fool a CNN-based face recognition system and pass unrecognized in front of the camera.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="data-intensive-training"><p>Data-intensive training</p></h3>
<p>For CNNs to showcase their magical power, they demand tons of training data. This data is not easy to collect and pre-process which can be an obstacle to the wider adoption of the technology. That is why even today there are only a few good pre-trained models such as GoogleNet, VGG, Inception, AlexNet. The majority are owned by global corporations.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-convolutional-neural-networks-used-for%3F"><p>What are convolutional neural networks used for?</p></h2>
<p>Convolutional neural networks are used across many industries. Here are some common examples of their use for real-life applications.</p>
<h3 id="image-classification"><p>Image classification</p></h3>
<p>Convolutional neural networks are often used for image classification. By recognizing valuable features, CNN can identify different objects on images. This ability makes them useful in medicine, for example, for MRI diagnostics. CNN can be also used in agriculture. The networks receive images from satellites like LSAT and can use this information to classify lands based on their level of cultivation. Consequently, this data can be used for making predictions about the fertility level of the grounds or developing a strategy for the optimal use of farmland. Hand-written digits recognition is also one of the earliest uses of CNN for computer vision.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="object-detection"><p>Object detection</p></h3>
<p>Self-driving cars, AI-powered surveillance systems, and smart homes often use CNN to be able to identify and mark objects. CNN can identify objects on the photos and in real-time, classify, and label them. This is how an automated vehicle finds its way around other cars and pedestrians and smart homes recognize the owner’s face among all others.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="audio-visual-matching"><p>Audio visual matching</p></h3>
<p>YouTube, Netflix, and other video streaming services use audio visual matching to improve their platforms. Sometimes the user’s requests can be very specific, for example, ‘movies about zombies in space’, but the search engine should satisfy even such exotic requests.</p>
<h3 id="object-reconstruction"><p>Object reconstruction</p></h3>
<p>You can use CNN for 3D modelling of real objects in the digital space. Today there are CNN models that create <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08008">3D face models</a> based on just one image. Similar technologies can be used for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin#:~:text=A%20digital%20twin%20is%20a,a%20physical%20object%20or%20process.&amp;text=Digital%20twins%20are%20the%20result,product%20design%20and%20engineering%20activities.">digital twins</a>, which are  useful in architecture, biotech, and manufacturing.</p>
<h3 id="speech-recognition"><p>Speech recognition</p></h3>
<p>Even though CNNs are often used to work with images, it is not the only possible use for them. ConvNet can help with speech recognition and natural language processing. For example, Facebook’s speech recognition technology is based on convolutional neural networks.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up"><p>Summing up</p></h2>
<p>To sum up, convolutional neural networks are an awesome tool for computer vision and similar areas because of their ability to recognize features in raw data.</p>
<p>They can recognize the connections between different pixels in training data and use this information to engineer features on their own, building up from low-level (edges, circles) to high-level (faces, hands, cars).</p>
<p>The problem is the features can become rather incomprehensible to humans. Moreover, a wild pixel in the image can sometimes lead to new surprising results.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_wired_co_uk_article_amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>Well over 100 employees at Amazon Prime Air have lost their jobs and dozens of other roles are moving to other projects abroad as the company shutters part of its operation in the UK, WIRED understands. Insiders claim the future of the UK operation, which launched in 2016 to help pioneer Amazon’s global drone delivery efforts, is now uncertain.</p><p>Those working on the UK team in the last few years, who spoke on condition of anonymity, describe a project that was “collapsing inwards”, “dysfunctional” and resembled “organised chaos”, run by managers that were “detached from reality” in the years building up to the mass redundancies.</p><p>They told WIRED about increasing problems within Prime Air in recent years, including managers being appointed who knew so little about the project they couldn’t answer basic work questions, an employee drinking beer at their desk in the morning and some staff being forced to train their replacements in Costa Rica. Amazon says it still has staff working for Prime Air in the UK, but has refused to confirm headcount.</p><p>Just five years ago, Prime Air’s UK operations were at the centre of a frenzied public relations campaign, with Amazon executives claiming that drones would be delivering packages within a few years. The company <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/in-the-community/innovation-for-the-next-generation-prime-air-lab-tours&#34;}" href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/in-the-community/innovation-for-the-next-generation-prime-air-lab-tours" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">offered tours of its secret drone lab to local schools</a>, <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/amazon-beefs-up-drone-delivery-rd-in-cambridge/&#34;}" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/amazon-beefs-up-drone-delivery-rd-in-cambridge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">opened a huge new office</a> in <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/amazon-beefs-up-drone-delivery-rd-in-cambridge/&#34;}" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/amazon-beefs-up-drone-delivery-rd-in-cambridge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> and released an array of <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNySOrI2Ny8&amp;ab_channel=amazon&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNySOrI2Ny8&amp;ab_channel=amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">promotional videos</a> for the flights that received <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXo_d6tNWuY&amp;ab_channel=amazon&#34;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXo_d6tNWuY&amp;ab_channel=amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">millions of views</a>. UK regulators also fast-tracked approvals for drone testing, which made the country an ideal testbed for drone flights and paved the way for Amazon to gain regulatory approval elsewhere.</p><p>But in the intervening years the tours stopped, the promotional videos were unlisted from Amazon’s YouTube channel and, bar occasional promises from executives like Jeff Wilke that <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48536319&#34;}" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48536319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">delivery drones would become a reality “within months”</a>, the firm’s previously widespread PR campaign disappeared. Meanwhile, despite being one of the first big companies to show interest in drones, Amazon was overtaken by <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512658/google-alphabet-wing-drone-delivery-service-faa-approval-commercial-deliveries&#34;}" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512658/google-alphabet-wing-drone-delivery-service-faa-approval-commercial-deliveries" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alphabet-owned Wing</a> and <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/ups-wins-faa-approval-for-drone-delivery-airline.html&#34;}" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/ups-wins-faa-approval-for-drone-delivery-airline.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UPS</a> in the race for US regulatory approval. Now, half a decade after first conducting UK test flights, the project’s entire UK data analysis team is being made redundant.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson says it will still have a Prime Air presence in the UK after the cuts, but refuses to disclose what type of work will take place. The spokesperson also refused to confirm, citing security reasons, if any of the test flights that once filled promotional videos will still take place in the UK. The spokesperson adds that the company has found positions in other parts of its business for some affected employees and that it will keep growing its presence in the region. The spokesperson did not confirm how many employees were offered other jobs internally.</p><p>Insiders say that cracks first began to show in the Prime Air project in late 2019 amid a constant reshuffling of workers and managers. At the time, the drone team was segmented into three divisions that analysed footage for different threats: humans and animals, other man-made objects in the sky and 3D mapping, which helped drones know the difference between a lawn, and say, a swimming pool. Frequent hiring sprees, mostly through temp agencies, bolstered the data analysis team, which made up a large chunk of Prime Air’s UK operations in Cambridge.The department was tasked with manually going through test flight footage and identifying relevant threats or objects – essentially using machine learning to train Amazon drones.</p><p>In those final months of 2019, former workers claim there was near constant churn, from entry level employees to managers. One former employee described having three different managers in the space of one month as staff and senior members of the team were reshuffled or moved out of the Prime Air project.</p></div></div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>Those management exits increasingly started to include senior managers, like Tom Denlegh-Maxwell, who had been with the project since its inception and left in December 2019. “There was a point when they did bring in four or five new managers [into my team] all at once,” one former employee explains. “And a lot of managers were leaving quite quickly, often within a year of joining Prime Air.” Another compares the exodus to “rats off a [sinking] ship”.</p><p>They also say that many of the newly appointed people were lifelong Amazon managers who specialised in logistics or warehouse operations and had little to no knowledge of the technicalities of the work being done in the project. The former employees WIRED spoke to say they could never approach managers for help with any kind of technical problems on the project, because they did not know how to help them.</p><p>While all this was happening, engineers were trying to do something unprecedented. While other drone companies aim to drop packages from several meters in the air or from even higher using parachutes, Amazon engineers had to figure out how to make drones land outside people’s homes and deposit a package from barely above the ground.</p><p>Building such a system was a huge engineering and machine learning challenge. The systems required to make drones land outside people’s homes were heavy and Amazon’s drones ballooned to about 27 kilograms, according to Andreas Raptopoulos, CEO of drone company Matternet, which is heavier than the threshold used by some authorities to classify a small drone. Entering that higher weight category comes with a variety of extra regulations, including higher safety requirements to protect people on the ground from potential collisions. “The hard bit is the last two metres off the ground. It’s astonishing what machine learning can do, but it’s also astonishing what it gets wrong,” says professor Arthur Richards, head of aerial robotics at the Bristol Robotics Lab.</p><p>As Prime Air grappled with these issues, they soon hit other, less technical problems. Insiders describe how the parameters for the project regularly changed with no explanation – for example being told to avoid identifying people standing behind windows in drone footage, and then told to do the opposite. Another source says their only contact with the central office was an American executive, who would visit every few months, buy the team pizza and then ask them to double their workload, without any explanation or answering any questions. “The best living metaphor for it all is that you had some bloke on the other side of the planet telling you what to do and then just leaving,” the source claims. “When you have that little communication between people in an organisation I don’t know how you expect anything to get done.”</p><p>In February 2020, WIRED understands the entire human and animals data analysis team in the UK, which employed dozens of people, was shuttered and its staff reassigned to other teams. Three months later it was reopened and restaffed three months later. “It was definitely very dysfunctional and there was definitely a lot of disorganisation,” says the former employee. “There was a lot of decision making made in the moment without long term thought to it. It was almost slinging shit at the wall and hoping stuff would stick.” Another former employee says it felt like the project was in a constant state of “organised chaos”.</p><p>At around the same time Amazon began restructuring and triggering job losses, as managers admitted in a stand-up meeting for data analysts that the promise of permanent employment was no longer on the table for those currently on precarious contracts, crushing the team’s already battered morale.</p></div></div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content"><p>“It was a Monday and it was about 11am or 12pm and this guy just had this open can of Stella,” explains one former employee. “He took it out of a fridge and popped it open at his desk.” Another describes an employee pinning down the ‘approve’ button on their computer so that all the frames of footage were being approved irrelevant of whether there were hazards in them or not. “Everything started collapsing inwards because they [Amazon] piled too much on, they put people in charge who didn’t know anything about the project and they oversold. It’s all one gigantic oversell – just so many promises that can’t be kept,” one former employee says. An Amazon spokesperson says safety is a top priority for the drone project and that it has rigorous procedures in place to check the work of employees and that swift action was taken in any cases of misconduct.</p><p>The former employee cited a different stand-up meeting in early 2020 that was pitched as a chance for short-term contracted employees to ask questions about the lack of permanent opportunities. Instead, the source claims, it turned out to be a seminar on how contractors could describe their jobs in their CVs without breaking non-disclosure agreements. “It was a good example of how detached from reality they were,” they say. “It wasn’t trying to help you out, it was just covering their own backsides.”</p><p>Amazon says its <a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html&#34;}" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">regulatory clearance in the US</a>, which was greeted with fanfare and speculation about an oncoming future of automated drone delivery last summer, will allow it to start conducting new test flights in the country. But that same clearance and ability to conduct test flights has been in place in the UK since 2016 and has yet to deliver a fleet of working drones. An Amazon spokesperson did not clarify how test flights happening in the US would be substantially different from those that had already happened in the UK.</p><p>Raptopoulos says that promises of mass market e-commerce drone delivery happening within months, or even a couple of years, are far from reality. “Can we cross the next bridge to mass e-commerce delivery? I would see it in the later half of the decade – 2027 or 2028,” he explains. “When people say five or so years, they tend to mean ‘I’m not sure, but not right now’.”</p><p>Throughout the rest of 2020 and into 2021, more Prime Air staff in the UK were either phased out from short term contracts or made redundant. Staff say they were also told to train their replacements in Costa Rica. Amazon has not confirmed whether there will be further redundancies in the UK, nor whether its plans for a global Prime Air project will involve further outsourcing. And, after years of disruption, some insiders doubt whether Amazon will ever realise its drone delivery dreams. “When I was there Prime Air was already years from being a thing,” explains one of the former employees. “But it’s never going to get off the ground.”</p><hr/><p><strong>More great stories from WIRED</strong></p><ul><li>💼 Sign-up to WIRED’s business briefing: <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/newsletters/work-smarter?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc">Get Work Smarter</a></li><li>How many people really have <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/long-covid-cases?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc">long Covid?</a></li><li>Black footballers played better <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/football-racism-performance?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc">without fans</a></li><li>EVs are changing the future of <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/electric-vehicles-breakdown?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc">roadside breakdown</a></li><li>Get organised.

deliberately middle-of-the-road
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix01/full_papers/bonwick/bonwick.pdf">thread-caching</a>
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/courses/cs194-24-S13/hand-outs/bonwick_slab.pdf">slab allocator</a>,
with <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/7afb9781fd25b8cee62afa555b9d38f391131044/include/slitter.h#L7-L44">explicit allocation class tags</a>
(rather than derived from the object’s size class).
It’s mostly written in Rust, and we use it in our C backend server.</p><p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/slitter">Slitter</a>’s design is about as
standard as it gets: we hope to dedicate the project’s complexity
budget to always-on “observability” and safety features. We don’t
wish to detect all or even most memory management errors, but we
should statistically catch a small fraction (enough to help pinpoint
production issues) of such bugs, and <em>always</em> constrain their scope to
the mismanaged allocation class.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>We decided to code up Slitter last April, when we noticed
that we would immediately benefit from backing allocation with
temporary file mappings:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
the bulk of our data is mapped from
persistent data files, but we also regenerate some cold metadata
during startup, and accesses to that metadata have amazing locality,
both temporal and spatial (assuming bump allocation). We don’t want the OS
to swap out all the heap–that way lie <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/06/15/gray-failure-the-achilles-heel-of-cloud-scale-systems/">grey failures</a>–so
we opt specific allocation classes into it.</p><p>By itself, this isn’t a reason to write a slab allocator: we could
easily have configured <a href="http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks">specialised arenas in jemalloc</a>,
for example. However, we also had eyes on longer term improvements to
observability and debugging or mitigation of memory management errors in
production, and those could only be unlocked by migrating to an
interface with explicit tags for each allocation class (type).</p><p>Classic mallocs like <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">jemalloc</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/google/tcmalloc">tcmalloc</a> are fundamentally
unable to match that level of integration: we can’t tell <code>malloc(3)</code>
what we’re trying to allocate (e.g., a <code>struct request</code> in the HTTP
module), only its size. It’s still possible to wrap malloc in a richer
interface, and, e.g., track heap consumption by tag. Unfortunately,
the result is slower than a native solution, and, without help from
the underlying allocator, it’s easy to incorrectly match tags between
<code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> calls. In my experience, this frequently leads to
useless allocation statistics, usually around the very faulty code
paths one is attempting to debug.</p><p>Even once we have built detailed statistics on top of a regular
malloc, it’s hard to convince the underlying allocator to only recycle
allocations within an object class: not only do mallocs eagerly
recycle allocations of similar sizes regardless of their type, but
they will also release unused runs of address space, or repurpose them
for totally different size classes. That’s what mallocs are supposed
to do… it just happens to also make debugging a lot harder when
things inevitably go wrong.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><p>Slab allocators work with semantically richer allocation tags:
an allocation tag describes its objects’ size, but can also
specify how to initialise, recycle, or deinitialise them. However,
slab allocators tend to focus exclusively on speed.
<a href="https://github.com/omniti-labs/portableumem">Forks of libumem</a>
may be the exception, thanks to the Solaris culture of pervasive
hooking. However, <code>umem</code>&#39;s design reflects the sensibilities of the
00s, when it was written: threads share a few caches, and the
allocator tries to reuse address space. In contrast, Slitter assumes memory
is plentiful enough for thread-local caches and type-stable
allocations.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><h2 id="our-experience-so-far">Our experience so far</h2><p>We have been running <a href="https://crates.io/crates/slitter">Slitter</a> in
production for over two months, and rely on it to:</p><ul><li>detect when an allocation is freed with the wrong allocation class
tag (i.e., detect type confusion on free).</li><li>avoid any in-band metadata: there are guard pages between
allocations and allocator metadata, and no intrusive freelist for
use-after-frees to stomp over.</li><li>guarantee <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/osdi96/full_papers/greenwald/node2.html">type stable allocations</a>:
once an address has been used to fulfill a request for a certain
allocation class, it will only be used for that class. Slitter
doesn’t overlay intrusive lists on top of freed allocations, so the
data always reflects what the application last stored there. This
means that double-frees and use-after-frees only affect the faulty
allocation class. An application could even rely on
read-after-free being benign to simplify non-blocking algorithms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></li><li>let each allocation class specify how its backing memory should
be mapped in (e.g., plain 4 KB pages or file-backed swappable pages).</li></ul><p>Thanks to extensive contracts and a mix of hardcoded and random tests,
we encountered only two issues during the initial rollout, both in the
small amount of lock-free C code that is hard to test.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p><p>Type stability exerts a heavy influence all over Slitter’s design, and
has obvious downsides. For example, a short-lived application that
progresses through a pipeline of stages, where each stage allocates
different types, would definitely waste memory if it were to replace a
regular malloc with a type-stable allocator like Slitter. We believe
the isolation benefits are more than worth the trouble, at least for
long-lived servers that quickly enter a steady state.</p><p>In the future, we hope to also:</p><ul><li>detect when an interior pointer is freed.</li><li>detect simple<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> buffer overflows that cross allocation classes, by inserting guard pages.</li><li>always detect frees of addresses Slitter does not manage.</li><li>detect most back-to-back double-frees.</li><li>detect a random fraction of buffer overflows, with a sampling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Fence">eFence</a>.</li></ul><p>In addition to these safety features, we plan to rely on the allocator
to improve observability into the calling program, and wish to:</p><ul><li>track the number of objects allocated and recycled in each
allocation class.</li><li>sample the call stack when the heap grows.</li><li>track allocation and release call stacks for a small fraction of objects.</li></ul><p>Here’s how it currently works, and why we wrote it in Rust, with dash
of C.</p><h2 id="the-high-level-design-of-slitter">The high level design of Slitter</h2><p>At a <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/fa8629989cb63ca5a4acdc2d26741bccda79aac0/doc/design.md">high level</a>,

inspired by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix01/full_papers/bonwick/bonwick.pdf">Bonwick’s slab allocator</a>,
and time-tested mallocs may well provide better performance
and lower fragmentation than Slitter.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
The primary motivation for designing Slitter is that having explicit
allocation classes in the API makes it easier for the allocator to
improve the debuggability and resilience of the calling program.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
For example, most allocators can tell you the size of your program’s
heap, but that data is much more useful when broken down by struct
type or program module.</p><p>Most allocators try to minimise accesses to the metadata associated with
allocations. In fact, that’s often seen as a strength of the slab
interface: the allocator can just rely on the caller to pass the
correct allocation class tag, instead of hitting metadata to figure
out there the freed address should go.</p><p>We went in the opposite direction with Slitter. We still rely on the
allocation class tag for speed, but also actively look for mismatches
before returning from deallocation calls. Nothing depends on
values computed by the mismatch detection logic, and the resulting
branch is trivially predictable (the tag always matches), so we can
hope that wide out-of-order CPUs will hide most of the checking
code, if it’s simple enough.</p><p>This concern (access to metadata in few instructions) combined with
our goal of avoiding in-band metadata lead to a
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/7afb9781fd25b8cee62afa555b9d38f391131044/src/mill.rs#L6-L19">simple layout for each chunk’s data and metadata</a>.</p><pre><code>.-------.------.-------|---------------.-------.
| guard | meta | guard | data ... data | guard |
&#39;-------&#39;------&#39;-------|---------------&#39;-------&#39;
  2 MB    2 MB   2 MB  |      1 GB        2 MB
                       v
               Aligned to 1 GB
</code></pre><p>A chunk’s data is always a 1 GB address range, aligned to 1 GB: the
underlying mapper doesn’t have to immediately back that with memory,
but it certainly can, e.g., in order to use gigantic pages. The chunk
is preceded and followed by 2 MB guard pages. The metadata for the
chunk’s data lives in a 2 MB range, just before the preceding guard
page (i.e., 4 MB to 2 MB before the beginning of the aligned 1 GB
range). Finally, the 2 MB metadata range is itself preceded by a 2MB
guard page.</p><p>Each chunk is statically divided in 65536 spans of 16 KB each. We can
thus map a span to its slot in the metadata block with a shifts,
masks, and some address arithmetic. <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/7afb9781fd25b8cee62afa555b9d38f391131044/src/mill.rs">Mill</a>s
don’t have to hand out individual 16 KB spans at a time, they simply
have to work in multiples of 16 KB, and never split a span in two.</p><h2 id="why-we-wrote-slitter-in-rust-and-c">Why we wrote Slitter in Rust and C</h2><p>We call Slitter from C, but wrote it in Rust, despite the
more painful build<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> process: that pain isn’t going
anywhere, since we expect our backend to be in a mix of C, C++, and
Rust for a long time. We also sprinkled in some C when the
alternative would have been to pull in a crate just to make a couple
syscalls, or to enable unstable Rust features: we’re not
“rewrite-it-in-Rust” absolutists, and merely wish to use Rust for its
strengths (control over data layout, support for domain-specific
invariants, large ecosystem for less performance-sensitive logic, ability to
lie to the compiler where necessary, …), while avoiding its
weaknesses (interacting with Linux interfaces defined by C headers, or
fine-tuning code generation).</p><p>The majority of allocations only interact with the thread-local
magazines. That’s why we <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/main/c/cache.c">wrote that code in C</a>:
stable Rust doesn’t (yet) let us access <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/fn.likely.html">likely/unlikely annotations</a>,
nor <a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf#page=35">fast “initial-exec”</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29594">thread-local storage</a>.
Of course, allocation and deallocation are the main entry points into
a memory allocation library, so this creates a bit of friction with
Rust’s linking process.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p><p>We also had to implement our <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/blob/main/c/stack.c">lock-free multi-popper Treiber stack</a>
in C: x86-64 doesn’t have anything like LL/SC, so we instead pair
the top-of-stack pointer with a generation counter… and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32976#issuecomment-641360955">Rust hasn’t stabilised 128-bit atomics</a> yet.</p><p>We chose to use atomics in C instead of a simple lock in Rust because
the lock-free stack (and the atomic bump pointer, which Rust handles
fine) are important for our use case: when we rehydrate cold metadata
at startup, we do so from multiple I/O-bound threads, and we have
observed hiccups due to lock contention in malloc. At some point,
lock acquisitions are rare enough that contention isn’t an issue;
that’s why we’re comfortable with locks when refilling bump allocation
regions.</p><h2 id="come-waste-performance-on-safety">Come waste performance on safety!</h2><p>A recurring theme in the design of <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter">Slitter</a>
is that we find ways to make the core (de)allocation logic slightly
faster, and immediately spend that efficiency on safety, debuggability
or, eventually, observability. For a lot of code, performance is a
constraint to satisfy, not a goal to maximise; once we’re close to
good enough, it makes sense to trade performance
away.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> I also believe that there are
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub50370/">lower hanging fruits in memory placement</a>
than shaving a few nanoseconds from the allocation path.</p><p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/slitter">Slitter</a> also focuses on
instrumentation and debugging features that are always active, even in
production, instead of leaving that to development tools, or to logic
that must be explicitly enabled. In a SaaS world, development and
debugging is never done. Opt-in tools are definitely useful, but
always-on features are much more likely to help developers catch
the rarely occurring bugs on which they tend to spend an inordinate
amount of investigation effort (and if a debugging feature can be
safely enabled in production at a large scale, why not leave it
enabled forever?).</p><p>If that sounds like an interesting philosophy for a slab allocator,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter">come hack on Slitter</a>!
Admittedly, the value of Slitter isn’t as clear for pure Rust hackers
as it is for those of us who blend C and Rust, but per-class allocation
statistics and placement decisions should be useful, even in safe
Rust, especially for larger programs with long runtimes.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter">MIT-licensed code is on github</a>,
there are <a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/slitter/issues">plenty of small improvements to work on</a>,
and, while we still have to re-review the documentation, it has decent
test coverage, and we try to write straightforward code.</p><p>We’re also <a href="https://backtrace.io/careers/">hiring</a> for <a href="https://saucelabs.com/company/careers/job?gh_jid=3363441">the platform team</a>,
if you like our problem-solving approach.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

   <p>Twenty-five years ago, the 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified — nearly two centuries after it was written. The improbable story of how that happened starts with the Founding Fathers themselves and winds up at the University of Texas. And it&#39;s a heartening reminder of the power of individuals to make real change.</p>   <p>Let&#39;s back up to 1982. A 19-year-old college sophomore named Gregory Watson was taking a government class at UT Austin. For the class, he had to write a paper about a governmental process. So he went to the library and started poring over books about the U.S. Constitution — one of his favorite topics.</p>   <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never forget this as long as I live,&#34; Watson says. &#34;I pull out a book that has within it a chapter of amendments that Congress has sent to the state legislatures, but which not enough state legislatures approved in order to become part of the Constitution. And this one just jumped right out at me.&#34;</p>   <p>The unratified amendment read as follows:</p>      <p>&#34;No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an election of representatives shall have intervened.&#34;</p>   <p>In other words, any raise Congress votes to give itself can&#39;t take effect until after the next election, so constituents can decide whether they deserve it.</p>   <div id="res526940303">

   <p>The amendment had been proposed almost 200 years earlier, in 1789. It was written by James Madison and was intended to be one of the very first constitutional amendments, right along with the Bill of Rights.</p>   <p>But it didn&#39;t get passed by enough states at the time. To ratify an amendment, three-quarters of state legislatures need to approve it.</p>   <p>And it turned out that the 200-year-old proposed amendment didn&#39;t have a deadline.</p>   <p>Watson was intrigued. He decided to write his paper about the amendment and argue that it was still alive and could be ratified. He turned it in to the teaching assistant for his class — and got it back with a C.</p>   <p>Watson was baffled. He was sure the paper was better than a C.</p>   <p>He appealed the grade to the professor, Sharon Waite.</p>   <p>&#34;I kind of glanced at it, but I didn&#39;t see anything that was particularly outstanding about it and I thought the C was probably fine,&#34; she recalls.</p>      <p>Most people would have just taken the grade and left it at that. Gregory Watson is not most people.</p>   <p>&#34;So I thought right then and there, <em>&#39;I&#39;m going to get that thing ratified.&#39; </em>&#34;</p>   <p><strong>Lobbying lawmakers</strong></p>   <p>He needed 38 state legislatures to approve the amendment. Nine states had already approved it, mostly back in the 1790s, so that meant Watson needed 29 more states to ratify it. He wrote letters to members of Congress to see whether they knew of anyone in their home states who might be willing to push the amendment in the state legislature. When he did get a response, it was generally negative. Some said the amendment was too old; some said they just didn&#39;t know anyone who&#39;d be willing to help. Mostly, he got no response at all.</p>   <p>But then, a senator from Maine named William Cohen did get back to him. Cohen, who later served as secretary of defense under President Clinton, passed the amendment on to someone back home, who passed it on to someone else, who introduced it in the Maine Legislature. In 1983, state lawmakers passed it.</p>   <p>&#34;So I&#39;m thinking, &#39;my first success story; this can actually be done&#39;,&#34; Watson says.</p>   <p>Feeling emboldened, he started writing to every state lawmaker he thought might be willing to help. He wrote dozens of letters. After a while, it started to work. Colorado passed the amendment in 1984. And then it picked up momentum. Five states in 1985. Three each in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Seven states in 1989 alone.</p>   <p>By 1992, 35 states had passed the amendment. Only three more to go. After 10 years of letter-writing, sweet-talking and shaming, Watson was within reach of his goal.</p>   <p>On May 5, 1992, both Alabama and Missouri passed the amendment. And on May 7, as Watson listened on the phone, the Michigan House of Representatives put it over the top.</p>   <p>His quest was finally over: More than 200 years after it was written, the 27th Amendment was finally ratified.</p>   <p>&#34;I did treat myself to a nice dinner at an expensive restaurant,&#34; Watson recalls.</p>   <p>What&#39;s so striking about this story is the sheer degree of difficulty of what Gregory Watson did. Amending the Constitution is — by design — incredibly hard to do. In fact, the 27th Amendment is still the most recent amendment to the Constitution.</p>   <p>It turns out that one person really can make a difference.</p>   <p>&#34;I wanted to demonstrate that one extremely dedicated, extremely vocal energetic person could push this through,&#34; Watson says. &#34;I think I demonstrated that.&#34;</p>   <p>He has kept pursuing these kinds of quests since then. In 1995, he realized Mississippi had never ratified the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery. So he pushed that state&#39;s Legislature to do it — and it worked. It was symbolic, but it meant something. (Due to a filing error, the ratification was not officially recorded until 2013 ... but that&#39;s another story.)</p>   <div id="res526939983">

   <p><strong>Making the grade</strong></p>   <p>Back in 1992, as Watson celebrated his achievement with the 27th Amendment, things weren&#39;t going as well for his former professor, Sharon Waite. She had moved from Austin back to South Texas in the 10 years since Watson was her student. She tried to get a teaching job down there, with no luck.</p>   <p>&#34;I was feeling sorry I&#39;d spent all those years studying and you know ... nothing!&#34; Waite says.</p>   <div id="res526946731">

   <p>She would look at all the papers and books and stuff she&#39;d collected over the years getting her master&#39;s degree and her doctorate and wondered, &#34;What was it all for?&#34;</p>   <p>Until one day, she got a phone call from someone writing a book about constitutional amendments.</p>   <p>&#34;They said, &#39;Well did you teach at UT Austin in the early &#39;80s?&#39; and I said, &#39;Yes I did,&#39; &#34; Waite says. &#34;And then they asked, &#39;Did you know that one of your students, Gregory Watson, pursued getting this constitutional amendment passed because you gave him a bad grade?&#39; &#34;</p>   <p>Waite was blown away. And in that moment, she felt redeemed.</p>   <p>&#34;Many people have said you never know what kind of effect you&#39;re going to have on other people and on the world. And now I&#39;m in my 70s, I&#39;ve come to believe that&#39;s very, very true. And this is when it really hit me because I thought to myself, &#39;You have, just by making this fellow a grade he didn&#39;t like, affected the U.S. Constitution more than any of your fellow professors ever thought about it, and how ironic is that?&#39;&#34;</p>   <p>And with the benefit of hindsight, Waite says, Watson clearly doesn&#39;t deserve that C she gave him.</p>   <p>&#34;Goodness, he certainly proved he knew how to work the Constitution and what it meant and how to be politically active,&#34; she says. &#34;So, yes, I think he deserves an A after that effort — A-plus!&#34;</p>   <p>And that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>   <p>On March 1, Waite signed a form to officially change Watson&#39;s grade. Thirty-five years after Gregory Watson wrote his paper, he finally got his C changed to an A.</p>   <div id="res526941074">

                        Tesla received 17,000 reservations for the Cybertruck last week alone, according to an unofficial reservation tracker.                    </h2>
                                                <div>
                                <p>People are still submitting reservations for the <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="2" data-params="%7B%22alias%22%3A%22tesla%22%7D">Tesla</a> Cybertruck at a remarkable rate almost two years after the electric pickup’s public unveiling.</p>
<p>Last week alone, Tesla has received more than 17,000 orders for the Cybertruck, bringing the total to more than 1.25 million with only months remaining until the start of production. That means that around 250,000 pre-orders have been placed since May 2021, when the reservation spreadsheet exceeded the 1 million-mark.</p>
<p>According to data coming from an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-pre-orders-reservations-1-2-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online reservation tracker</a> created by fans, the Tesla Cybertruck has unofficially racked up 1,256,487 pre-orders so far. Should they materialize into firm orders, Tesla would pocket a whopping $79 billion in revenue.</p>
    


<p>Unsurprisingly, such a high number of orders would also make the Cybertruck the leader of the electric pickup truck segment. However, some rivals have amassed impressive reservation figures as well. Ford’s F-150 Lightning, for example, has <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/523153/ford-f150-lightning-reservations-120000/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22523153%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22ford-f150-lightning-reservations-120000%22%7D">reached 120,000 pre-orders</a> only two and a half months after its unveiling.</p>
<p>Back to the Cybertruck, the same unofficial source reveals that around 48% of the total reservations are for the Cybertruck’s Dual Motor configuration, while the least popular model is the Single Motor with only about 7% of the combined pre-orders.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Elon Musk has no reason to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/520667/musk-admits-cybertruck-could-flop/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22520667%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22musk-admits-cybertruck-could-flop%22%7D">fear the Cybertruck could flop</a>. However, such a high number of reservations likely means that holders will have to be very patient to take delivery of their Tesla electric pickups.</p>
<p>Any production delays would obviously make matters worse. Tesla recently announced that Giga Texas, the plant that will build the Cybertruck, will start making the Model Y crossover first. There’s no firm production start date for the Cybertruck yet, although Elon Musk previously said that low-volume manufacturing would begin before the end of this year, followed by mass production in 2022.</p>

      <title>The Death of the All-Powerful Director: Michael Cimino’s ‘Heaven’s Gate’</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="QrS2nH"><em>Over the next week at </em>The Ringer<em>, in honor of the release of </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62RmIsx6MA">Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage</a><em>, we will explore events that changed the world as we knew it—specifically ones that marked the ends of established eras and triggered the beginnings of then-unknown futures. Some will be overt and well established. Others will be less trodden and perhaps more speculative. But all will entertain an immovable idea that when things die, there is someone or something that pulled the trigger. Welcome to </em><a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2021/7/20/22585243/welcome-to-this-is-the-end-week"><em>This Is the End Week</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<hr id="xyEWNL"/>
<p id="YtPa6C">“Here are the spent shell casings,” writes Steven Bach in the introduction to his extraordinary 1985 book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Final-Cut-Making-Heavens-Artists/dp/1557043744"><em>Final Cut</em></a>, which chronicles the legendarily troubled production of <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>. Bach paints the making of the film as a war of attrition between its director, Michael Cimino, and the studio that signed off on its making. As in all the bloodiest and most intractable battles, neither side could really claim victory. All that Bach could do as the last man standing was try to tell the tale.</p>
<p id="9Thuif">History is written by the winners, except when they conveniently forget to put pen to paper; the script for <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>was based on an obscure but shocking 19th-century episode in which a group of Wyoming cattle barons hired Texan militiamen to confront and eradicate a contingent of settlers on their land. It was a genocide carried out with the tacit approval of regional governmental authorities, and Cimino’s fictionalized retelling was meant to elicit anger and shame. But the military narrative evoked in Bach’s scrupulously detailed behind-the-scenes account—compiled during the author’s tenure as senior vice president at United Artists in the late 1970s—is closer to Custer’s Last Stand, with a stubborn, doomed general holding his ground and amassing casualties right up until the final shot.</p>
<div id="prJ4fK"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmTI3xYO6mQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RqE2xZ">The broad strokes are that after arriving in Montana with his cast and crew and a mandate to follow his muse, Cimino went mad with power. He tore down and rebuilt expensive sets on a whim and shot endless retakes, to the point that even Stanley Kubrick would have had no choice but to eat his heart out. Time is money, and Cimino spent both like there was no tomorrow. At one point, several months (and over a million feet of film) into the shoot, star John Hurt complained to the press that he was going to miss out on his previously arranged gig making <em>The Elephant Man </em>while <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>spun its wheels. By the time Hurt had flown to England to act for David Lynch and back, Cimino was finally ready to shoot his scenes. Denied access to dailies and later locked out of the editing room, the film’s producers contemplated firing their director (or maybe even worse) and rejected the five-hour assembly cut he showed them. By the time <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>opened in November 1980, a year after its targeted release date, its budget had swelled by several hundred percent (with some estimates placing it at $50 million) and the knives were out. In <em>The New Yorker</em>,<em> </em>a ready-and-waiting <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2020/01/23/pauline-kael-trash-art-movies/">Pauline Kael called it “a movie you want to deface”</a>; other critics followed suit, splattering Cimino’s epic with unflattering adjectives and scaring off even the most curious audiences in the process.</p>
<p id="r1tAvq">But occasionally, history also gets rewritten so that the losers become the winners, and 40 years after its arrival as a pop-cultural punch line—an unfortunate, notorious metonym for a big-budget flop—<em>Heaven’s Gate </em>looks more and more like a movie that lost the battle but won the war, or at least a few hearts and minds. Perhaps inevitably, given the combination of its outsized ambition and the severity of its failure, Cimino’s film has been passionately reclaimed by critics—a collective response to Kael’s calls for defacement. It’s also been <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2568-heaven-s-gate-western-promises">canonized by the Criterion Collection</a>, a company whose imprimatur signifies a commitment to the idea of cinema-as-art: what Bach evocatively calls the “the war to create art from technology and ambition and will.” What makes <em>Final Cut </em>such a compelling book is the way its author leverages his very real frustration with the situation and its participants (especially Cimino) against bigger-picture thinking about what was at stake in the making of <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>. It was a crystallized moment when auteurist autonomy—good, bad, and ugly—bumped up against increasingly anodyne, corporatized studio ownership. </p>
<p id="tSCmgF">Since its inception, United Artists had always symbolized a synthesis between art and commerce. In 1919, D.W. Griffith, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Charlie Chaplin consolidated their resources, connections, and celebrity into a new studio that sought to counteract the overarching control and influence of the period’s vertically integrated monoliths (and their power-tripping bosses). Operating as a studio without an actual backlot, UA cultivated relationships with established and emerging directors, backing John Huston on <em>The African Queen </em>and Sidney Lumet on <em>12 Angry Men</em>;<em> </em>in the 1960s, its brain trust smartly pitched in overseas to help launch the James Bond franchise and Sergio Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns. When the company was purchased in 1967 by the insurance-oriented Transamerica Corporation, it looked like a solid marriage of faceless capital and long-held artistic principles. But Transamerica blanched at having its name on extreme releases like <em>Midnight Cowboy </em>and <em>Last Tango in Paris </em>(hence the great sight gag in Philip Kaufman’s UA-financed <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers </em>framing San Francisco’s Transamerica pyramid as the epicenter of an alien conspiracy). After <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>flopped in an explosion of bad publicity and worse vibes, Transamerica sold its ownership to the highest bidder. </p>
<p id="qMcTz3">The irony of a company forged out of the bonds of creative solidarity being undone by a director run amok is potent verging on mythic, and with its nearly four-hour running time, ensemble cast, and sprawling Montana landscapes, <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>is just about monumental enough to withstand the burdens placed on it by history. You can look at it as the death knell for United Artists, as the Last Picture Show of the New Hollywood, or possibly, one last spectacular Pyrrhic victory just before The Empire—call it the New New Hollywood, same as the Old Hollywood—Struck Back.</p>
<hr id="qZaScf"/>
<p id="67jjbY"><em>Heaven’s Gate </em>was green-lit by UA in 1978 as a direct result of Cimino’s success with <em>The Deer Hunter</em>,<em> </em>a movie that represented one species of grand, outsized cinematic achievement. <em>The Deer Hunter </em>was a post-Vietnam psychodrama with echoes of <em>The Best Years of Our Lives</em>; as cowritten and directed by Cimino, its allegory of broken men trying and failing to rebuild was powerful, pretentious, and also politically ambiguous enough to have its characters gather together and sing “God Bless America” at the close. Whether it was meant as a hymn or a protest was up to the viewer. Never mind that Cimino copped his climactic Greek chorus conceit from Robert Altman’s wryer (and superior) bicentennial satire <em>Nashville</em>—whose own, originally composed theme song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BYyDusJYJo">“It Don’t Worry Me”</a> cut deeper post-Watergate than Irving Berlin’s repurposed wartime patriotism—or that an extended set piece at a wedding aped <em>The Godfather. </em>Brilliantly staged and phenomenally acted by a definitive late-’70s cast including Robert De Niro; John Cazale; Meryl Streep; and an unblinking, Oscar-winning Christopher Walken, <em>The Deer Hunter </em>had the same kind of art-blockbuster pedigree as Francis Ford Coppola’s film<em>, </em>yoked to a more sensationalistic sensibility. </p>
<p id="DtPEwH">The problem was that the other species of grand, outsized cinematic achievement flourishing at that moment were special-effects-driven hits like <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Superman. </em>The latter was no. 1 at the box office as <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>went into preproduction, and looks in retrospect like its bizarro twin: a risky, expensive investment that went off schedule, ran over budget, and cultivated murderous resentments between its director and his producers. Of course, you could say some of the same things about <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Jaws</em>,<em> </em>both of which left their casts and crews physically and emotionally exhausted. Except with those two movies (and <em>Superman</em>),<em> </em>the strife was incurred in the service of an authentically popular moviegoing vision.</p>
<p id="ZEnwbA">What Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Richard Donner understood, whether instinctively or with some measure of cynicism, was that the same audience that had developed a taste for challenging and even unpalatable mainstream movie-making—of downers like <em>The Deer Hunter</em>—was also hungering, desperately, for popcorn fare. What <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Jaws </em>had in common was a defined view of evil, which either wore black or had a dorsal fin. With <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>,<em> </em>Cimino was simultaneously cashing in his chips from <em>The Deer Hunter </em>and placing a big bet (with his financiers’ capital) that a drama costing about as much as <em>Star Wars </em>(set less far away and minus any explicitly crowd-pleasing elements or adorable robots) could extend both his personal winning streak and staunch the flow of escapism swamping the industry. </p>
<p id="P9htx5">The first thing that <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>had going against it, commercially speaking, was its genre. By the late 1970s, the Western, which had shaped the visual and thematic vocabulary of American cinema and served as fertile territory for national mythmaking (and revisionism), had faded from box-office prominence; the wistful, elegiac tones of movies like Robert Altman’s <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller </em>and Sam Peckinpah’s <em>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid </em>gave them the feeling of requiems. The hard-driving frontiersmen and searchers of Monument Valley period pieces had migrated into steel-and-concrete jungles, with Clint Eastwood serving as a bridging figure: As it turned out, Dirty Harry was a pretty good modern moniker for the Man With No Name. The crackling, urban energy of cop thrillers, palpable also in the steady stream of Blaxploitation movies made in its shadow, was irresistibly contemporary, and while Western archetypes abounded in other genres—after all, what is <em>Jaws </em>but the story of a stubborn local sheriff gathering up a posse to hunt down a vicious outlaw?—its surfaces had become dusty and outdated, or else used in gimmicky ways (as in the lumpy satire of Sydney Pollack’s <em>The Electric Horseman</em>, about a rodeo rider who’s sold out to a cereal manufacturer). </p>

<p id="cKguwu">Originally titled <em>The Johnson County War</em>,<em> </em>Cimino’s screenplay—written in 1971, before the filmmaker had any credits or stroke—examined vintage Western themes of conflict and community, investigating America’s melting-pot heritage and drawing parallels between capitalist exploitation past and present. Its heroes were Harvard-educated boys who receive a brutal education in property and economics after heading West, where they fall in with a hardscrabble cohort of settlers rustling cattle as a means of survival. The script attracted interest from Steve McQueen and was pitched to John Wayne, but when it came time to cast <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>,<em> </em>Cimino didn’t go the movie star route. While you’d have been hard pressed to find better actors circa 1978 than Kris Kristofferson, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, and Christopher Walken—a true murderers’ row—none of them were necessarily box-office draws; after impulsively offering the lead female role to Isabelle Huppert, Cimino was castigated by executives who would have preferred Jane Fonda or Diane Keaton. “No one has ever heard of her,” Bach quotes himself as telling the director during yet another in a series of tense meetings, “and as of this moment we have no marquee other than Kristofferson.” What Cimino left unsaid was that these choices, beyond their artistic merit, would ensure that once the cameras were rolling, <em>he </em>was the star of <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>—the real marquee attraction.</p>
<p id="TVAcDO">Tales of Cimino’s unchecked ego and arrogance proliferated at every stage of his career; accepting the Best Director Oscar for <em>The Deer Hunter</em>,<em> </em>he noted—not as a joke—that it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3fdS8KkLyI">“difficult to leaven pride with humility.”</a> He also dismissed media criticisms of <em>The Deer Hunter</em>’s myriad historical inaccuracies and shockingly unsubtle racism with a snideness that swiftly turned journalists against him. Hence the rabid, borderline-morbid media fascination with <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>’s<em> </em>increasingly troubled production, which, while on one level was in a great tradition of rubbernecking industry gossip dating back to disasters like <em>Queen Christina </em>and <em>Cleopatra</em>,<em> </em>also channeled larger anxieties. In 1962, when <em>Cleopatra </em>had started careening out of control, the story was about Elizabeth Taylor’s mental health and mood swings, and the attempts of producers and directors to placate her larger-than-life whims. With <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>,<em> </em>the culprit—fingered unanimously by actors and crew members leaking information from the set—was Cimino, who, in his resistance to creative input and his increasingly despotic disposition, became the poster boy for the dangers of auteur megalomania.</p>
<p id="KMZZWg">In truth, there were plenty of other contemporaneous candidates to serve as cautionary tales on this front. If the main innovation of the New Hollywood had been how its initiates inhabited and exploded classical forms in ways that excited viewers—as in <em>The Godfather</em>’s<em> </em>blend of 1940s setting and aesthetics with startlingly bloody violence—the increasing confidence of these practitioners led them, collectively, on Icarus-like trajectories. Around the same time that <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>The Deer Hunter </em>were on their victory laps, <em>Sorcerer</em>; <em>New York, New York</em>;<em> </em>and <em>1941 </em>tarnished the glows emanating respectively from William Friedkin, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg. In each case, the story was that the filmmakers had overstepped the boundaries of their talent and exceeded the possibility of return on investment. </p>
<p id="uWO54C">Francis Ford Coppola’s experiences making <em>Apocalypse Now </em>in the Philippines (another United Artists production) were every bit as harrowing as Cimino’s misadventures in the West. But if <em>Apocalypse Now </em>is the cinematic equivalent of a phoenix—an incandescent monster rising from the flames of its own making—<em>Heaven’s Gate </em>only sporadically achieves liftoff in between the long, unhurried passages of moseying that Cimino intended to impart measures of depth and dread. There’s nothing in it with the operatic punch of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>’s<em> </em>Wagner-with-helicopters bombing run, or even the sleazy grandeur of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Decko2h-S20">USO strip show set to Flash Cadillac’s cover of “Suzie Q.”</a> Instead, its centerpiece sequence features characters spinning aimlessly in circles—a fiddle-driven, full-cast hoedown at the eponymous Johnson County roller rink that cycles on and on for a miniature eternity, at once tedious and exhilaratingly carnivalesque, a last waltz that never ends.</p>

<p id="FvFgrd">Narratively speaking, the 10-minute interlude at Heaven’s Gate does next to nothing for <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>,<em> </em>but as a utopian vision of American community—of immigrants, interlopers, and working-class stiffs living it up before the ruling class lowers the boom—it’s genuinely poetic. Which is why James Cameron stole it wholesale for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erAQ9LkftwA">steerage-class dance party in <em>Titanic</em>,</a><em> </em>another potential doppelgänger for <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>except that its maker’s megalomania resulted in coronation rather than exile. The two movies’ fortunes are like inverses of one another, with Cimino guessing wrong that a throwback period piece could compete with state-of-the-art sci-fi, and Cameron—the most assiduous inheritor of Spielberg and Lucas’s kingdom—going earnest and old-school in a post-Tarantino moment of ironic overkill. To give <em>Titanic </em>its due, it’s a cleaner and clearer piece of storytelling than <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>with a more romantic view of history, and in picking Kate Winslet over a host of more established actresses, Cameron hit a bull’s-eye that Cimino missed with the then-untested Huppert. And yet its CGI looks flimsy compared to <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>’s<em> </em>analog grandeur, and its class critique is purely cartoony, absent the righteous sense of fury that informed Cimino’s attempt to memorialize (in fictionalized form) a country’s betrayal of its own assimilationist promises.</p>
<p id="Vr1t24">“Movies matter,” writes Bach toward the close of <em>Final Cut</em>,<em> </em>noting that the flip side of this maxim is that their costs matter too. The industry takeaway from <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>was not so much that movies were getting too expensive as that the wrong <em>kinds </em>of movies were being made for too much money, a consensus that placed a premium on accessibility. Instead of trusting that a brilliant filmmaker could move the needle on what constituted mainstream fare—whether by daring or forcibly dragging an audience to meet them halfway—executives grew hesitant to subsidize anything too far outside of a particular comfort zone, and the movies got blander and more innocuous as a result. In the 1980s, there was a proliferation of so-called high-concept projects whose contents could be summed up in a single sentence and efficiently conveyed by marketing departments. Meanwhile, difficult, chipped-shoulder directors like Cimino, who was banished once and for all after the failure of his overwrought 1985 cop epic <em>Year of the Dragon</em>, grew marginalized; it’s not a coincidence that of all the significant filmmakers who emerged in the 1970s, it was the unruliest ones (Cimino, Robert Altman, and Francis Ford Coppola) who had the rockiest time, while Spielberg and Lucas were able to operate on cruise control. </p>
<p id="uSOb9E">It’s genuinely futile to argue for <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>as a strictly good or bad movie, and yet it’s also evasive to take a middle position. Too much was risked, lost, or straight-up immolated in its making to consign it to the category of either-or. It may be less that history has vindicated its flaws—the laconic pacing, shameless speechifying, and blurry dramaturgy surfacing at regular intervals—and more that those flaws feel as nostalgic and far away as its virtues. In 1980, <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>was the biggest target around, and duly besieged for it. But if it’s hard to imagine anything like it being made today, the reasons are disappointing to contemplate. <em>Heaven’s Gate </em>is a cautionary tale with a deceptive epilogue, as the aforementioned high-concept contingencies of the ’80s did anything but provide an antidote to Hollywood bloat. Instead, they amplified it in ways we’re still paying for, one deadening franchise at a time. After reading <em>Final Cut</em>,<em> </em>it’s all but impossible to be sympathetic to Cimino. But after watching <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>, and knowing what was coming next, it’s all but impossible not to be. </p>

      <title>Beautiful Disasters: The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T (2015)</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___mubi_com_notebook_posts_beautiful-disasters-the-5000-fingers-of-dr-t/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p></p><p>We spend years viewing the world through the eyes of a child before abandoning it. Not the world, that is—but we grow into players in the game of Life, rub our heavy eyelids, and take to ever-trippy existence from a heightened perspective in which our formative fears and fantasies are filtered through a scope less blurry, unadulterated. And then in doing so we leave a little something behind. For a grown-up to be considered “childish” comes with more negative connotations than posi, but to retain one’s inner child is a paramount strength. So what is the difference?</p><p>Theodore Geisel, also known under the pseudonym Dr. Seuss, authored the most celebrated children’s literature of his time. He presented generations upon generations whimsical visions which, in proper auteur style, require just a single glance to recognize as work of his. Geisel’s simply-worded fables were praised for encouraging youth to learn to read while simultaneously being wrought with moral and sociopolitical undertones. If you haven’t spent the 2000s dwelling under a rock or in a mountaintop cavern overlooking Whoville, you’re likely well-aware of and have had your go at the Hollywood adaptations of <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> and<i> The Cat in the Hat</i>. Yet only those who travel in certain circles know this underrated piece of trivia: That back in the 50s, the Dr-who-wasn’t-really-a-doctor Seuss penned an original live-action musical film. Why has this information largely eluded us? It’s because the picture was a bit of a bomb that exploded nowhere but inward on itself. </p><p>The film is entitled<i> The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T</i>, and tells the tale of an all-American lad trapped in the clutches of the nefarious Dr. Terwilliker—whose music academy is luring in young boys to practise their playing on an oversized piano, assembly line-style, until the end of their days. Geisel originally submitted a 1200-page screenplay with “themes of world dominance and oppression following World War II,” but over the course of the production this epic-to-be was whittled down into a Freudian fever dream that didn’t particularly score well with either the youngsters or critics of America. Dr. T has since gained a late-night-TV sort of following, but upon its 1953 release experienced less than rapture in vain of his picture books’ reception. During the shoot on a particular day, one of the 150 kid extras the budget allowed for ate a spoiled hot dog and vomited all over the Seussian instrument—inciting a chain reaction among the 149 others, who followed suit in covering the piano keys in puke. Geisel claimed that much the same occurred among those who reviewed his one-and-only real involvement with the movies. Thus an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment ensured that not even 1 of Doctor Terwilliker’s 5000 fingers made an appearance in his official biography. So what was it? Was <i>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T</i> a childish misstep on the parts of a studio on the rise, the kid who would go on to star in Lassie, and one beloved author?</p><p>The fact of the matter may be that the musical fantasy came out the eensiest bit too adult. The Dr. Terwilliker character, played by Hans Conried, harnesses the two greatest fears of a juvenile male: That his mother be brainwashed and hidden away in a castle like Mario’s Princess Peach; and that an active adolescent mind be coerced into eternal discipline firmly planted on a piano’s bench. This mad villain plays the J.K. Simmons role from <i>Whiplash</i>, terrorizing students into mastery of their craft by working them to the bone. The doomed protégé subject to it is little Bart Collins, played by Tommy Rettig, whom applies his Boy Scout determination to foil Dr. T’s evil plot while also acting as matchmaker to his mother and the handsome plumber Mr. Zabladowski. Lacking a father figure, Bart cannot bear to see his mother under the tyranny of Dr. Terwilliker, mimicking Alexander’s gaze toward the devilish mom-marrying bishop in Bergman’s <i>Fanny and Alexander</i>. In a sturdy proud citizen’s voice, Zabladowski delivers the coda: “After all, motherhood is the noblest institution in our land.”</p><p></p><p>Such political undercurrents might be the skeletal basis for a story which seems to have been conceived as one elaborate metaphor. The scenario of an ally propagandized by an evil authoritarian is certainly a Cold War era paranoia—the term ‘brainwash’ only dates back to the 50s, having entered our lexicon after usage by the United States military during the Korean War. The concoction mixed by Bart and Zabladowski to eliminate Dr. Terwilliker’s map is, although appearing severely more innocent in the film, a variation on a weapon of mass destruction. Today’s audience must find it a bit laughable when Bart is asked if the solvent is atomic and he responds “Yes Sir, VERY atomic!”, as if these are the most lethal words that could ever be spoken. It’s ceased to resonate, because visions of mushroom clouds aren’t dancing through our heads during routine duck-and-cover exercises at school. But the 1950s climate was tense, and the overarching anxiety—and the means by which any problem could eventually meet with its solution—was the big, beautiful bang.</p><p>Other aspects of the film feel like previews to next week’s episode in the US of A. There are the children summoned to labour away for their leader, straight out of a fascio-capitalist fantasy. There’s dashing proletariat Mr. Zabladowski, bought out of his morality to fix sinks in Terwilliker’s lair, paid only in an assortment of curious Seuss currencies he admits he’s not sure he’ll ever see. Terwilliker, striking a chord, confides he’s hauling in stacks of Benjamins courtesy of “the pocketbooks of unsuspecting mothers.” The academy promises it’ll transform its attendees into concert pianists whilst being a trap, and one must immediately recollect today’s impossible North American school system and the student debt bound to an endless number of scholastic mean-wellers with little other options.</p><p>When Bart and Zabladowski’s plan to save the day is foiled, they are sent for a ride on a hell-bent elevator straight to the dungeon. The elevator doorman is sweaty and muscular, sporting leather tights and a mask that resembles bondage headgear. As they descend into the depths of the castle he sings a morose ditty of what awaits them should he open the door on each floor they pass: </p><p>“<i>Leg chains, ankle chains</i></p><p><i>Neck chains, wrist chains</i></p><p><i>Thumbscrews and noosests of the very finest rope</i>”</p><p></p><p>﻿﻿This is the darkest of Dr. T’s 5000 shades, but it isn’t the only sexually mature innuendo in the children’s flick. Each of the underground guards is leather bar hot, and the imprisoned musicians they watch over a scantily-clad band of merry men whom gyrate and prance around with a lightness of foot that almost puts the Nicholas Brothers to shame. In this air of not-so-repressed queerness however, Dr. T’s flamboyancy takes the cake. As a family production erected during the heyday of the Hays Code—the Hollywood Production Code that prohibited positive portrayals of queer characters or content—it’s no surprise that the creepy antagonist possess the mannerisms and attributes a public at large would generally constitute with homosexuality. His moment to shine arises in the musical number where he orders his minions to dress him in his finest array before takeover day, and in a way that’s camp as hell, requests his “undulating undies with the marabou frills,” and his “beautiful bolero with the porcupine quills.”</p><p>In fact, said game of dress-up provided inspiration for Mr. Burns’ silly “See My Vest” number in the sixth season of <i>The Simpsons</i>. As it were, the song and dance of <i>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T</i> is pretty hit-or-miss. The aforementioned all-male dungeon escapade might resemble a clash between Kenneth Anger and Busby Berkeley, but haphazardly climbs into peaks of bliss out of chaos. These reach-for-the-top legs are the ones the entire film kind of lopsidedly leaps on. Billed as “the wonder musical of the future!”, the children’s fantasy was maybe intended to follow in the footsteps of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, but in Technicolor surreality propelled into some other dimension, landing closer to an imperfect <i>The Red Shoes</i>. The torrent by which I was able to view the film, after all, beheld these download instructions:  1. eat lots of acid, 2. fire up in your favorite media player, 3. enjoy!</p><p></p><p>﻿﻿Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is one of the ways the movie is now being viewed. It’s probably inevitable. Theodore Geisel’s grand dream may have warped before his very eyes into a Hollywood nightmare that soured his foray into the cinéworld forever, but always, louder than bombs is the soundless switching of our lens to take a look at things in the crystal-clear way they aren’t—or maybe are—but ever in a new light that illuminates its meaning. Matt Groening admitted to receiving countless influences from <i>Dr. T</i> in creating<i> The Simpsons</i>—Bart is named after the film’s hero and even sports a spiky yellow hairdo in reference to the Happy Fingers cap Tommy Rettig carries atop him throughout his adventure. Hats like these are rare collectors’ items nowadays, and go for sums of money whenever they arise on eBay. One man’s trash, as always, is another’s treasure.</p><p>The movie’s masterpiece moment occurs at its exact midpoint, when Tommy Rettig as Bart takes to the stage by his lonesome to sing a lament of nonexistent children’s rights. “<i>Just because you’ve whiskers on your face to shave, You treat us like a slave… So what? It’s only hair. Just because you wear a wallet near your heart, You think you’re twice as smart. You know that isn’t fair.</i>” Not merely as a child, but as the little guy fighting against the vast governmental evil in the world, this scene exudes what the film portrays best: the pathos of the powerless. After the picture’s disastrous reception, I’m sure many who gave it its heart and soul sat alone and thought thoughts expressed in these lyrics, among them Dr. Seuss, channeling his inner child to coo: “<i>You have no right, you have no right, to boss and beat us little kids about.</i>”﻿</p><p></p><p>***</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mario Paint: A 1992 Masterpiece</title>
      <link>https://www.charlieharrington.com/mario-paint-masterpiece</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_charlieharrington_com_mario-paint-masterpiece/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since having a child, I&#39;ve been on a nostalgia Mega Drive. If you know anything about me, then you&#39;ll probably agree I was already at alarming levels of the stuff, and I&#39;ve now likely reached the nostalgia mesosphere, even if just for a minute or so.</p>
<p>In particular, videos games are dominating my reminiscences. I&#39;ve been thinking about their role in my development as a human. Spoiler alert: it&#39;s an extremely positive one.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one game that stands out: Mario Paint. </p>
<p>This 1992 &#34;edutainment&#34; title (a word seemingly devised to revile kids) is a forgotten masterpiece of creativity, fun, and weirdness.</p>
<p>At the surface, its existence doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense. It&#39;s a digital art and music app on the Super Nintendo that uses (comes with!) a separate mouse controller. I can name exactly one video game like this, ever.</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve learned in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54bXwb5DfRI&amp;vl=en">limited YouTube research</a>, although the Super Nintendo was always the more-parentally-acceptable console of the early 90s console wars (see Mortal Kombat SNES grey matter vs Sega Genesis blood), Nintendo was feeling the pressure to demonstrate that their &#34;family computers&#34; were actually forces for good in the battle for the attention span of the world&#39;s youth.</p>
<p>And, thus, Mario Paint.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/8942f9ff6c23d7a5496da8148f653a58/d2602/mariopaint.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>There&#39;s just no reason for this game to be this good. Sure, MS Paint on Windows was always a fun time-waster back in the day. But it certaintly wasn&#39;t weird. And Mario Paint is w-e-i-r-d. It&#39;s like Photoshop on Magic Mushrooms. Plus an animation studio. Plus a digital audio workstation (aka Garageband). And all this back when we were still recording our favorite songs from the radio on cassette tapes (if we were lucky enough to catch them, and even then usually missing the first few bars). </p>
<p>Don&#39;t talk to me about delightful UIs or UXs if you haven&#39;t played Mario Paint. Nothing makes sense at a glance. Instead, it&#39;s pure discovery. Click-and-see. The undo button is a dog&#39;s face. Why? Why not. The fill-paint animation is a break-dancing paint-brush with a smiley-face (that sentence had a lot of hyphens). I spent hours and hours clicking every button in Mario Paint, and just making weird shit.</p>
<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not like I exclusively played Mario Paint from 1992 forward (I probably didn&#39;t get it until 1993 or 1994 anyway). But I&#39;d find myself drawn back to Mario Paint way more often than my parents even expected.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, Mario Paint reminds me of that poster of kindergarten classroom yore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything I need to know in life I learned in Mario Paint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I like making <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/relay">weird songs</a> on Garageband? Mario Paint</p>
<p>Why do I like making <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/lendup-critters">logos for bands and apps</a> and companies? Mario Paint.</p>
<p>Why am I a software engineer? Mario Paint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, Charlie, there&#39;s no &#34;game engine&#34; or programming environment in Mario Paint. What-so-ever do you mean? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought you&#39;d never ask. In 2015, I was living in London working in business development for an edtech startup, traveling a whole lot, with a bunch of downtime in airports. I decided to Carpe Diem the idle-airport-time to teach myself programming (something I&#39;d been trying to do, on and off, for the previous seven years), so I bought a Big Nerd Ranch iPhone book. When my company planned a two-day hackathon, I pledged to build a little iPhone app, following the book step-by-step. I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/introducing-knerds">written about this experience before</a>, so I won&#39;t fully rehash it. But the key thing is that, in addition to the basic Tinder/flash-card UX, I decided to add some fun little characters for the app (designed by my co-worker and pal <a href="https://www.dfxm326.com/">Dan McGorry</a>). Then, these characters obviously needed a backstory. A week or so later, I traveled back to New Jersey for my aunt&#39;s wedding and I was showing the app to anyone who would listen (not many). Except for my 9 year old cousin. She bit hard. She came up with even more ideas for their powers (hair that grows to become a bridge, melting down into a popsicle liquid so you can glide, and so on). The kicker: the next day, my aunt delivered to me some enemies for the game that my cousin had drawn, like Chill Factor:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>I knew then and there that I wanted to <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">create wonderful things, be good, and have fun</a> for my career. I quit my job and studied to become a computer programmer.</p>
<p>Now, years in, am I creating wonderful things ever day? Not necessarily. But I try to keep the joy and weirdness alive in whatever I do.</p>
<p>Last week, I asked my mom to dig through my boxes in the attic to find my Super Nintendo Mouse. She graciously delivered. Even the intro screen screen to Mario Paint is a lesson in weirdness. I love-love-love it:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOlsR96Mf1A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>After about a half hour or so, I produced this masterpiece:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxtT-gWPSbM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Yes, the main riff is more-or-less China Cat Sunflower by the Grateful Dead (I think).</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only one who loves Mario Paint, particularly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122335/nintendo-mario-paint-music-composers-snes">the music-maker</a>. There&#39;s a whole Internet of magic <a href="https://github.com/DC37/Super-Mario-Paint">Mario Paint</a> music like this, the entire back-side of Abbey Road (including secret track <em>Your Majesty</em>!): </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0Jz3BgNWTc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>I can&#39;t believe that this game exists (and still works!). I guess edutainment ain&#39;t so bad after all. For now, back to the drawing board!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There are a ton of great explainers of what graph neural networks are.
However, I find that a lot of them go pretty deep into the math pretty quickly.
Yet, we still are faced with that age-old problem: where are all the pics??
As such, just as I had attempted with Bayesian deep learning,
I&#39;d like to try to demystify graph deep learning as well,
using every tool I have at my disposal
to minimize the number of equations and maximize intuition using pictures.
Here&#39;s my attempt, I hope you find it useful!</p>
<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/index.html">Network Analysis Made Simple tutorial</a>,
we see that the term &#34;graph&#34; are really nothing more than
a synonym for networks.
Defined strictly, graphs are comprised of <strong>nodes</strong>, i.e.
entities, and <strong>edges</strong> that define <em>relations</em> between nodes.
Examples are social networks (nodes = people, edges = friendship),
and flight networks
(nodes = airports, edges = flights that exist between the two networks).</p>
<p>Pictorially, we&#39;d usually draw something that looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A graph <span><span>G</span></span>, in really concise mathematical notation,
can be represented as <span><span>G = (V, E)</span></span>,
or in plain English,
an unordered collection of vertices (a synonym for nodes)
and an unordered collection of edges.</p>
<h2 id="graphs-as-arrays">Graphs as <em>arrays</em></h2>
<p>One thing that&#39;s a really neat property of graphs is that we can actually represent them as <em>arrays</em>.
This is covered in the <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/04-advanced/02-linalg/">Linear Algebra section</a> of <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/index.html">Network Analysis Made Simple</a>;
I also wrote about this in the earlier sections of an essay I wrote on <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/machine-learning/message-passing/">message passing</a>
that I&#39;d encourage you to check it out in its entirety,
but nonetheless here&#39;s a simplified version to introduce you to the key ideas.</p>
<p>Because graphs are comprised of nodes and edges,
we need to figure out a way of representing both of them as arrays.
Coming up, we&#39;ll explore how this can be done.</p>
<h3 id="representing-nodes-as-arrays">Representing nodes as arrays</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s start with nodes, our entities.
Our nodes, being entities, may have certain properties.
Let&#39;s use a concrete example of molecules,
which is what I would consider
a minimally complex example for exploring key ideas.
(I use minimally complex examples as my anchoring examples to learn an idea,
I hope this one is useful for you too!)</p>
<p>Imagine we have a molecule of ethanoic acid.
It&#39;s comprised of two carbons, two oxygen,
and four hydrogens joined in the following fashion:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each atom is a node, and edges are bonds between the atoms.
Each atom, or node, carries <em>properties</em> or <em>features</em>
which can be represented on the array.
For example, there&#39;s the atomic mass
(a floating point number, or integer if you desire to round it off).
There&#39;s the valence of the atom as well.
And many more!
To keep things simple, I&#39;ll stick to just these two for now.
As you can see, you&#39;ll end up with a <em>vector of features</em> per node.
If we stack them up together,
we get what we call a node feature matrix, which will become handy later.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="representing-edges-as-arrays">Representing edges as arrays</h3>
<p>Similarly, there is an array representation of edges too!
If you imagine lining up all of the atoms
inside the ethanoic acid molecule along a square matrix,
you can fill in the square matrix
based on whether an edge exists between those two atoms.
It&#39;ll look something like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we wanted to, though, we could get really granular!
We could have on adjacency matrix that shows us all of the single bonds,
and another adjacency matrix that shows all of the double bonds.
Or we could have an adjacency matrix that is <em>weighted</em>
based on the number of bonds between two atoms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those are all <em>perfectly valid representations</em> of the edges of a graph,
each with their own semantic meaning <em>and</em> tradeoffs
for whatever modelling problem you might have.</p>
<h2 id="message-passing">Message Passing</h2>
<p>It&#39;s now time to think about message passing.
Message passing is a very well-known operation
in the network science and machine learning worlds,
but you don&#39;t have to be intimidated about it!
At its core, it&#39;s actually really simple,
and you&#39;ll see that it totally has a linear algebra interpretation that,
in my opinion, is pretty elegant!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by defining what message passing on a graph is.</p>
<p>Message passing on a graph is kind of what you would intuit it to be:
if I have a message on a node,
we want to pass the message to other nodes on the graph.
Our message can only travel along the edges,
though - otherwise, the structure of the graph would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example that is really, really simplified.
(We&#39;ll see the exact same ideas in action
on our ethanoic acid example in a short moment.)
This example is drawn from my tutorial on network analysis,
in particular, from the linear algebra section.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we have a directed chain graph of four nodes.
A &#34;message&#34; lives on the first node,
and we want to pass it through the graph.
In a first message passing iteration,
we take the message on the first node and pass it to the next one.
In the iteration after, we take the message and pass it to the next node.
So on and so forth until we reach the last node.
Here, there&#39;s no place the message can go;
regardless of how many more steps we might desire to run message passing,
the message won&#39;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there&#39;s a linear algebra interpretation of message passing!
For the four node chain graph,
we can consider the message as being a property of a node.
For a node possessing the message,
or more generally a copy of the message,
we can assign it a value of 1.
If a node doesn&#39;t have a copy of the message,
then we assign it a value of 0.
Here&#39;s where the magic happens.
When we dot product the adjacency matrix against this message vector
(which is akin to our node feature vector),
the message will <em>move</em> from the first node to the next node.
(Verify this point for yourself by hand!)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So it seems we can pass messages around nodes by simply doing dot products!
Let&#39;s see this in action by looking at the same operation in action
for ethanoic acid.
Here, all nodes receive messages from their neighbors simultaneously.
Notice how the graph looks like after performing message passing.
The carbon attached to three hydrogens has
a different value from the carbon attached to the oxygens;
their value is the sum of their neighbors.
&#34;Summing up neighbors&#34; is literally all that we are doing
in this form of message passing,
in other words,
when we do a dot product of the adjacency matrix with a node feature matrix.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, I&#39;d encourage you to pause reading
and ponder over the ideas this far.
It was pretty mind-blowing for me when I first really made the connection
between message passing and linear algebra.
I spent a few good weeks mulling the ideas I just described.</p>
<h2 id="message-passing-neural-networks">Message Passing + Neural Networks</h2>
<p>We&#39;re now going to see how message passing
gets embedded inside a neural network -
a network that learns on network.
(Pretty meta, if you ask me!)</p>
<p>To anchor our understanding,
we will start with graph deep learning in a supervised learing setting,
where our learning task is to predict a scalar number
for every graph in a collection of graphs.
One classic example where this has been done before
is in chemical property prediction,
the first of which I encountered being a paper
by my deep learning teacher <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/">David Duvenaud</a>
on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09292">learning molecular fingerprints</a>.
Here, each input into the neural network is a <em>graph</em>,
rather than a <em>vector</em>.
For comparison, classical deep learning starts with rows of i.i.d. data
that are fed through a neural network.</p>
<p>We know that neural networks are composed of chains of math functions.
(Really, that&#39;s all neural network models are at their core!)
Feed forward neural networks chain together dot products;
convolutional neural networks add in n-dimensional convolutions in the mix;
meanwhile, recurrent neural networks have lag as part of its structure.
Each of these provide <em>inductive biases</em>.
By the way, that term, in my opinion,
is nothing more than a fancy way of saying that
we encode prior knowledge of our data generating process
into the mathematical model.
In each case, though, on a per-i.i.d.
sample basis, we pass in one n-dimensional array at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What about graph neural networks, then -
what exactly does the input look like,
and what is the general structure of such networks?
To answer those questions,
we&#39;re going to walk through
three different kinds of graph neural network layers,
the three that I&#39;m most familiar with,
as specific examples of the general form of graph neural nets.
By the end of us walking through them,
we should have a much clearer grasp of the math that underlies these models.</p>
<h3 id="message-passing-neural-networks-mpnns">Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)</h3>
<p>Message passing neural networks, as the name implies,
means we inject <em>message passing</em> as an operation in the neural network.
Let&#39;s see how we can define a message passing layer.
Instead of accepting just a vector or n-dimensional image,
the message passing layer accepts both the adjacency matrix
and the node feature matrix and performs one round of message passing.
But we know it&#39;s part of a <em>neural network</em>,
so where does the <em>neural</em> piece come in?
Well, right after message passing,
we take the message-passed node feature matrix
and apply the equivalent of a feed-forward neural network operation -
linear transform + some activation function!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can do this as many rounds as we desire -
though it&#39;s important to note that
we usually don&#39;t want to go for too many rounds.
The long story cut short is that
message passing has the effect of smoothing out node-level information,
which <em>could</em> become undesirable.</p>
<p>Once we have done one or two rounds of message passing,
it might be desirable to have a vector representation of our graphs.
But at the moment, we&#39;re stuck with two matrices -
the adjacency matrix and the messaged-passed node feature matrix!
Well, one canonical way of creating graph-level vector representations
is to simply take a node-wise summation (or average)
of the node feature matrix.
Summations express that the size of a graph matters,
while averages express that size should not matter.
What you choose will depend on your particular problem.
By the way, you as long as you have a reductive function
that takes the node feature matrix and reduces it to a vector,
you can satisfy the need to have a vector summary of a graph...
as long as you can explain the semantics :).
Regardless, let&#39;s call this layer a &#34;graph summary layer&#34;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once we have a vector-level representation of our graph,
we can stick classical feed forward neural network layers
on top of the graph processing layers
to obtain the thing we&#39;re trying to predict.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that, my friends, is how a classical message passing neural network works!
Here&#39;s the framework I use to remember how GNNs work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message passing operations, followed by</li>
<li>Graph summarization operations, followed by</li>
<li>Feed forward networks to predict output.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the broader machine learning framework of &#34;model, loss, optimizer&#34;,
all we&#39;ve worked on here is to design a <em>model</em>
that fits the kind of data that we have.
You get to keep constant the <em>loss</em> and the <em>optimizer</em>.
Keep this framework memorized,
and use MPNNs as the anchoring minimally complex example,
and everything else we discuss coming will become crystal clear!</p>
<h3 id="graph-laplacian-networks">Graph Laplacian Networks</h3>
<p>So what&#39;s up with graph laplacian networks?
Well, really, at its core is all that&#39;s been done here
is to replace each graph&#39;s adjacency matrix with their graph Laplacian matrix.
That&#39;s it!
Every other operation that you see in the pictures above remain the same.</p>
<p>But what is the graph Laplacian?
At its core, it&#39;s a measure of the local <em>derivative</em> of the graph,
and we use it when we want to express that
local differences in nodes matter to our graph-level property of interest.
To explain this idea here any further
would distract from our exploration of GNNs,
so I would refer you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">the Wikipedia entry</a>
for those of you who desire a deeper understanding
of this category of graph matrices.</p>
<h3 id="graph-attention-networks">Graph Attention Networks</h3>
<p>What about graph attention networks, then?
Well, we know that the attention mechanism
is nothing more than an operation that uses
a neural network inside a neural network to learn weights of <em>some</em> kind.
With graph attention networks,
we use an embedded neural network to learn
a per-graph adjacency-like matrix operator
that we mask over with the adjacency matrix,
which effectively gives us an edge attention matrix for message passing.
(If you&#39;re feeling antsy and want to read an actual paper on this,
check out the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903">graph attention networks paper</a> paper.)</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it! Everything else about the model can stay constant.</p>
<p>Graph attention layers give us the most general message,
data-driven passing operator that we can imagine.
Rather than fix the message passing operator <em>a priori</em>,
we simply learn the operator in a data-driven fashion.</p>
<h3 id="general-form-of-graph-neural-networks">General form of graph neural networks</h3>
<p>Okay, so we&#39;ve explored three examples of graph neural networks.
What exactly is general here? Here&#39;s the answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>We must have a message passing operator, <span><span>A</span></span>.
It can be learned or it can be provided <em>a priori</em>
and remain fixed throughout the neural network.
You basically have the freedom to define any form of <span><span>A</span></span> that you need!</li>
<li>We need to have node feature matrices, <span><span>F</span></span>.</li>
<li>For convenience,
we usually transform our graphs&#39; array representations <span><span>A</span></span> and <span><span>F</span></span>
into a summary vector that then gets processed
by a feed forward neural network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, what remains relatively constant is the <em>structure</em> of the model -
some form of generalized message passing
followed by some form of graph summarization followed by a top model.
As long as you have some sort of semantically-meaningful square matrix <span><span>A</span></span>
and a semantically-meaningful node feature matrix <span><span>F</span></span>,
you can follow the message passing -&gt; summarization -&gt; feed forward structure
to build your GNN models.</p>
<h2 id="mpnns-and-convolution-operations">MPNNs and convolution operations</h2>
<p>When David taught me about graph neural networks,
one idea really clicked:
how message passing generalizes the grid convolution to graphs -
which is why the &#34;graph convolution&#34; term shows up
in the deep learning literature.
Let&#39;s explore how this is the case
by looking carefully at a simple grid convolution
and a simple graph convolution.</p>
<p>Starting off with the simplest grid convolution,
let&#39;s say we have a 5x5 pixel image with a 3x3 convolution operator
comprised of <span><span>1</span></span>s everywhere except the middle cell.
When using the convolution operation (with certain border settings),
we get the following result:</p>
<p></p>
<p>We actually can re-represent the grid of values as a
lattice graph and do a message passing operation to obtain the same result:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And in doing so,
we thus can see that the message passing operation
using the adjacency matrix as our message passing operator
is equivalent to a convolution
with a filter of 1s surrounding a zero.
Message passing on graphs more generally simply requires that
we relax the condition that our graph be a lattice graph!</p>
<h2 id="graph-learning-tasks">Graph learning tasks</h2>
<p>Thus far, we explored how graph neural networks work
in the context of a supervised machine learning problem
where we want to build a model that links graphs as inputs
to a property of the entire graph.
Beyond this single learning task, though, there are other learning tasks.
From a talk that my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris522229197/">Chris Lin</a> delivered,
I learned that there are a few primary categories of graph learning tasks.
Here&#39;s a short overview of those learning tasks.</p>
<h3 id="graph-level-prediction">Graph-level prediction</h3>
<p>This is the category of problem we leveraged above
to explore the internals of graph neural networks.
Basically we frame the problem as &#34;given graph, predict number&#34;.
It assumes that we have a bunch of i.i.d.
data that have a natural graph structure as its representation.</p>
<h3 id="node-labelling">Node labelling</h3>
<p>This category of problems typically deals
with one large graph and its adjacency matrix,
and our desired output is a label (or a suite of labels)
that need to be annotated on nodes.
Some of the nodes have labels while others don&#39;t;
message passing could be handy here
because it encodes the <em>homophily</em> assumption -
that is, for problems where we expect
that similar things will be linked together,
we can encode this inductive bias into our models
much more naturally than other structural equations.</p>
<h3 id="edge-presenceabsence-prediction">Edge presence/absence prediction</h3>
<p>This is another class of problems where usually we are given one large graph,
and the desired output is either whether
an edge ought to exist between two nodes.
This can be framed in terms of predicting
the entries of the graph adjacency matrix, for example.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here, we started with array representations of single graphs.
Then, we covered the message passing operation,
which is a key operation in graph neural networks.
We explored how we can compose message passing, graph summarization,
and feed forward neural networks to do graph-level property prediction.
Finally, we did a quick tour through the general categories
of graph learning tasks in which graph neural networks are used.</p>
<p>It&#39;s taken me 2-3 months of procrastination, brainstorming,
and more to write all of this down, and even then,
I doubt I have comprehensively covered
all of the fundamentals of graph deep learning.
That said, I believe that in this essay,
we&#39;ve given ourselves a great starting point -
you might even say, a launchpad -
for delving into the vast swathe of literature out there.</p>
<h2 id="with-thanks">With Thanks</h2>
<p>I would like to give special thanks to my Patreon supporters,
Alejandro, Rafael, Fazal, Brian, Hector, Carol, and Eddie.
With the new kid, switching roles, and more of life hitting me in the face,
it&#39;s taken a bit of time for me to get this essay out,
but I&#39;m finally glad to have it done!</p>

      <title>The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security (2005)</title>
      <link>http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>There&#39;s lots of innovation going on in security - we&#39;re  inundated with a steady stream of new stuff and it all sounds like it works just great. Every couple of months I&#39;m invited to a new computer security conference, or I&#39;m asked to write a foreword for a new computer security book. And, thanks to the fact that it&#39;s a topic of public concern and a &#34;safe issue&#34; for politicians, we can expect a flood of computer security-related legislation from lawmakers. So: computer security is definitely still a &#34;hot topic.&#34; But why are we spending all this time and money and still having problems?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <em><strong>six dumbest ideas in computer security</strong></em>. What are they? They&#39;re the <em><strong>anti-</strong></em>good ideas. They&#39;re the braindamage that makes your $100,000 ASIC-based turbo-stateful packet-mulching firewall transparent to hackers. Where do <em><strong>anti-</strong></em>good ideas come from? They come from misguided attempts to do the impossible - which is another way of saying &#34;trying to ignore reality.&#34; Frequently those misguided attempts are sincere efforts by well-meaning people or companies who just don&#39;t fully understand the situation, but other times it&#39;s just a bunch of savvy entrepreneurs with a well-marketed piece of junk they&#39;re selling to make a fast buck. In either case, these dumb ideas are the fundamental reason(s) why all that money you spend on information security is going to be wasted, unless you somehow manage to avoid them. </p>
<p>For your convenience, I&#39;ve listed the dumb ideas in descending order from the most-frequently-seen. If you can avoid falling into the the trap of the first three, you&#39;re among the few true computer security elite. </p>
<h2>#1) Default Permit</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This dumb idea crops up in a lot of different forms; it&#39;s incredibly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Why? Because it&#39;s so attractive. Systems based on &#34;Default Permit&#34; are the computer security equivalent of empty calories: tasty, yet fattening.</p>
  <p>The most recognizable form in which the &#34;Default Permit&#34; dumb idea manifests itself is in firewall rules. Back in the very early days of computer security, network managers would set up an internet connection and decide to secure it by turning off incoming telnet, incoming rlogin, and incoming FTP. Everything else was allowed through, hence the name &#34;Default Permit.&#34; This put the security practitioner in an endless arms-race with the hackers. Suppose a new vulnerability is found in a service that is not blocked - now the administrators need to decide whether to deny it or not, hopefully, before they got hacked. A lot of organizations adopted &#34;Default Permit&#34; in the early 1990&#39;s and convinced themselves it was OK because &#34;hackers will never bother to come after us.&#34; The 1990&#39;s, with the advent of worms, should have killed off &#34;Default Permit&#34; forever but it didn&#39;t. In fact, most networks today are still built around the notion of an open core with no segmentation. That&#39;s &#34;Default Permit.&#34;</p>
  <p>Another place where &#34;Default Permit&#34; crops up is in how we typically approach code execution on our systems. The default is to permit anything on your machine to execute if you click on it, unless its execution is denied by something like an antivirus program or a spyware blocker. If you think about that for a few seconds, you&#39;ll realize what a dumb idea that is. On my computer here I run about 15 different applications on a regular basis. There are probably another 20 or 30 installed that I use every couple of months or so. I still don&#39;t understand why operating systems are so dumb that they let any old virus or piece of spyware execute without even asking me. That&#39;s &#34;Default Permit.&#34;</p>
  <p>A few years ago I worked on analyzing a website&#39;s security posture as part of an E-banking security project. The website had a load-balancer in front of it, that was capable of re-vectoring traffic by URL, and my client wanted to use the load-balancer to deflect worms and hackers by re-vectoring attacks to a black hole address. Re-vectoring attacks would have meant adopting a policy of &#34;Default Permit&#34; (i.e.: if it&#39;s not a known attack, let it through) but instead I talked them into adopting the opposite approach. The load-balancer was configured to re-vector any traffic <strong><em>not</em></strong> matching a complete list of correctly-structured URLs to a server that serves up image data and 404 pages, which is running a special locked-down configuration. Not surprisingly, that site has withstood the test of time quite well.</p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you&#39;ve got a case of &#34;Default Permit&#34; is when you find yourself in an arms race with the hackers. It means that you&#39;ve put yourself in a situation where what you don&#39;t know <em><strong>can</strong></em> hurt you, and you&#39;ll be doomed to playing keep ahead/catch-up.</p>
  <p>The opposite of &#34;Default Permit&#34; is &#34;Default Deny&#34; and it is a <em><strong>really</strong></em> good idea. It takes  dedication, thought, and understanding to implement a &#34;Default Deny&#34; policy, which is why it is so seldom done. It&#39;s not that much harder to do than &#34;Default Permit&#34; but you&#39;ll sleep much better at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#2) Enumerating Badness</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back in the early days of computer security, there were only a relatively small number of well-known security holes. That had a lot to do with the widespread adoption of &#34;Default Permit&#34; because, when there were only 15 well-known ways to hack into a network, it was possible to individually examine and think about those 15 attack vectors and block them. So security practitioners got into the habit of &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; - listing all the bad things that we know about. Once you list all the badness, then you can put things in place to detect it, or block it.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure 1: </strong>The &#34;Badness Gap&#34;</p>
  <p>Why is &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; a dumb idea? It&#39;s a dumb idea because sometime around 1992 the amount of Badness in the Internet began to vastly outweigh the amount of Goodness. For every harmless, legitimate, application, there are dozens or hundreds of pieces of malware, worm tests, exploits, or viral code. Examine a typical antivirus package and you&#39;ll see it knows about 75,000+ viruses that might infect your machine. Compare that to the legitimate 30 or so apps that I&#39;ve installed on my machine, and you can see it&#39;s rather dumb to try to track 75,000 pieces of Badness when even a simpleton could track 30 pieces of Goodness. In fact, if I were to simply track the 30 pieces of Goodness on my machine, and allow nothing else to run, I would have simultaneously solved the following problems:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Spyware</li>
  <li>Viruses</li>
  <li>Remote Control Trojans</li>
  <li>Exploits that involve executing pre-installed code that you don&#39;t use regularly</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to all the marketing hype around disclosing and announcing vulnerabilities, there are (according to some industry analysts) between 200 and 700 new pieces of Badness hitting the Internet every month. Not only is &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; a dumb idea, it&#39;s gotten dumber during the few minutes of your time you&#39;ve bequeathed me by reading this article. </p>
  <p>Now, your typical IT executive, when I discuss this concept with him or her, will stand up and say something like, &#34;That sounds great, but our enterprise network is <em>really</em> complicated. Knowing about all the different apps that we rely on would be impossible! What you&#39;re saying sounds reasonable until you think about it and realize how absurd it is!&#34; To which I respond, &#34;How can you call yourself a &#39;Chief Technology Officer&#39; if you have no idea what your technology is doing?&#34; A CTO isn&#39;t going to know detail about every application on the network, but if you haven&#39;t got a vague idea what&#39;s going on it&#39;s impossible to do capacity planning, disaster planning, security planning, or virtually any of the things in a CTO&#39;s charter.</p>
  <p>In 1994 I wrote a firewall product that needed some system log analysis routines that would alert the administrator in case some kind of unexpected condition was detected. The first version used &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; (I&#39;ve been dumb, too) but the second version used what I termed &#34;<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/ai/index.html">Artificial Ignorance</a>&#34; - a process whereby you <em>throw away the log entries you know aren&#39;t interesting</em>. If there&#39;s anything left after you&#39;ve thrown away the stuff you know isn&#39;t interesting, then the leftovers <em>must</em> be interesting. This approach worked amazingly well, and detected a number of very interesting operational conditions and errors that it simply never would have occurred to me to look for. </p>
  <p>&#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; is the idea behind a huge number of security products and systems, from anti-virus to intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, application security, and &#34;deep packet inspection&#34; firewalls. What these programs and devices do is<em> outsource</em> your process of knowing what&#39;s good. Instead of you taking the time to list the 30 or so legitimate things you need to do, it&#39;s easier to pay $29.95/year to someone else who will try to maintain an exhaustive list of all the evil in the world. Except, unfortunately, your badness expert will get $29.95/year for the antivirus list, another $29.95/year for the spyware list, and you&#39;ll buy a $19.95 &#34;personal firewall&#34; that has application control for network applications. By the time you&#39;re done paying other people to enumerate all the malware your system could come in contact with, you&#39;ll more than double the cost of your &#34;inexpensive&#34; desktop operating system.</p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you have a case of &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; is that you&#39;ve got a system or software that needs signature updates on a regular basis, or a system that lets past a new worm that it hasn&#39;t seen before. The cure for &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; is, of course, &#34;Enumerating Goodness.&#34; Amazingly, there is virtually no support in operating systems for such software-level controls. I&#39;ve tried using Windows XP Pro&#39;s Program Execution Control but it&#39;s oriented toward &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; and is, itself a dumb implementation of a dumb idea. </p>
  <p>In a sense, &#34;Enumerating Badness&#34; is a special dumb-case of &#34;Default Permit&#34; - our #1 dumb computer security idea. But it&#39;s so prevalent that it&#39;s in a class by itself.</p>

<h2>#3) Penetrate and Patch </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There&#39;s an old saying, &#34;You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow&#39;s ear.&#34; It&#39;s pretty much true, unless you wind up using so much silk to patch the sow&#39;s ear that eventually the sow&#39;s ear is completely replaced with silk. Unfortunately, when buggy software is fixed it is almost always fixed through the addition of new code, rather than the removal of old bits of sow&#39;s ear.</p>
  <p>&#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; is a dumb idea best expressed in the BASIC programming language:</p>
  <pre>10 GOSUB LOOK_FOR_HOLES
20 IF HOLE_FOUND = FALSE THEN GOTO 50</pre>
  <p>In other words, you attack your firewall/software/website/whatever from the outside, identify a flaw in it, fix the flaw, and then go back to looking. One of my programmer buddies refers to this process as &#34;turd polishing&#34; because, as he says, it doesn&#39;t make your code any less smelly in the long run but management might enjoy its improved, shiny, appearance in the short term. In other words, the problem with &#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; is not that it makes your code/implementation/system <em>better by design</em>, rather it merely makes it <em>toughened by trial and error</em>. Richard Feynman&#39;s &#34;<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/feynman.html">Personal Observations on the Reliability of the Space Shuttle</a>&#34; used to be required reading for the software engineers that I hired. It contains some profound thoughts on expectation of reliability and how it is achieved in complex systems. In a nutshell its meaning to programmers is: &#34;Unless your system was <em>supposed to be hackable </em> then it shouldn&#39;t be hackable.&#34;</p>
  <p>&#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; crops up all over the place, and is the primary dumb idea behind the current fad (which has been going on for about 10 years) of vulnerability disclosure and patch updates. The premise of the &#34;vulnerability researchers&#34; is that they are helping the community by finding holes in software and getting them fixed before the hackers find them and exploit them. The premise of the vendors is that they are doing the right thing by pushing out patches to fix the bugs before the hackers and worm-writers can act upon them. Both parties, in this scenario, are being dumb because if the vendors were writing code that had been designed to be secure and reliable then vulnerability discovery would be a tedious and unrewarding game, indeed!</p>
  <p>Let me put it to you in different terms: <em><strong>if &#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; was effective, we would have run out of security bugs in Internet Explorer by now</strong></em>. What has it been? 2 or 3 a month for 10 years? If you look at major internet applications you&#39;ll find that there are a number that consistently have problems with security vulnerabilities. There are also a handful, like PostFix, Qmail, etc, that were engineered to be compartmented against themselves, with modularized permissions and processing, and - not surprisingly - they have histories of amazingly few bugs. The same logic applies to &#34;penetration testing.&#34; There are networks that I know of which have been &#34;penetration tested&#34; any number of times and are continually getting hacked to pieces. That&#39;s because their design (or their security practices) are so fundamentally flawed that no amount of turd polish is going to keep the hackers out. It just keeps managers and auditors off of the network administrator&#39;s backs. I know other networks that it is, literally, pointless to &#34;penetration test&#34; because they were designed from the ground up to be permeable only in certain directions and only to certain traffic destined to carefully configured servers running carefully secured software. Running a &#34;penetration test&#34; for Apache bugs is completely pointless against a server that is running a custom piece of C code that is running in a locked-down portion of an embedded system. So, &#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; is pointless either because you know you&#39;re going to find an endless litany of bugs, or because you know you&#39;re not going to find anything comprehensible. Pointless is dumb. </p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you&#39;ve got a case of &#34;Penetrate and Patch &#34; is when you find that your system is always vulnerable to the &#34;bug of the week.&#34; It means that you&#39;ve put yourself in a situation where every time the hackers invent a new weapon, it works against you. Doesn&#39;t that sound dumb? Your software and systems should be <em>secure by design</em> and should have been <em>designed with flaw-handling in mind</em>.</p>

<h2> #4) Hacking is Cool</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the best ways to get rid of cockroaches in your kitchen is to scatter bread-crumbs under the stove, right? Wrong! That&#39;s a dumb idea. One of the best ways to discourage hacking on the Internet is to give the hackers stock options, buy the books they write about their exploits, take classes on &#34;extreme hacking kung fu&#34; and pay them tens of thousands of dollars to do &#34;penetration tests&#34; against your systems, right? Wrong! &#34;Hacking is Cool&#34; is a really dumb idea.</p>
  <p>Around the time I was learning to walk, Donn Parker was researching the behavioral aspects of hacking and computer security. He says it better than I ever could:</p>
  <p>Hidden in Parker&#39;s observation is the awareness that <strong><em>hacking is a social problem</em></strong>. It&#39;s not a technology problem, at all. &#34;<em>Timid people could become criminals.</em>&#34; The Internet has given a whole new form of elbow-room to the badly socialized borderline personality. The #4th dumbest thing information security practitioners can do is implicitly encourage hackers by lionizing them. The media plays directly into this, by portraying hackers, variously, as &#34;whiz kids&#34; and &#34;brilliant technologists&#34; - of course if you&#39;re a reporter for CNN, anyone who can install Linux probably <em>does</em> qualify as a &#34;brilliant technologist&#34; to you. I find it interesting to compare societal reactions to hackers as &#34;whiz kids&#34; versus spammers as &#34;sleazy con artists.&#34; I&#39;m actually heartened to see that the spammers, phishers, and other scammers are adopting the hackers and the techniques of the hackers - this will do more to reverse society&#39;s view of hacking than any other thing we could do.</p>
  <p>If you&#39;re a security practitioner, teaching yourself how to hack is also part of the &#34;Hacking is Cool&#34; dumb idea. Think about it for a couple of minutes: teaching yourself a bunch of exploits and how to use them means you&#39;re investing your time in learning a bunch of tools and techniques that are going to go stale as soon as everyone has patched that particular hole. It means you&#39;ve made part of your professional skill-set dependent on &#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; and you&#39;re going to have to be part of the arms-race if you want that skill-set to remain relevant and up-to-date. Wouldn&#39;t it be more sensible to learn how to design security systems that are hack-proof than to learn how to identify security systems that are dumb? </p>
  <p>My prediction is that the &#34;Hacking is Cool&#34; dumb idea will be a dead idea in the next 10 years. I&#39;d like to fantasize that it will be replaced with its opposite idea, &#34;Good Engineering is Cool&#34; but so far there is no sign that&#39;s likely to happen. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#5) Educating Users</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; can be applied to human beings, as well as software, in the form of user education. On the surface of things, the idea of &#34;Educating Users&#34; seems less than dumb: education is always good. On the other hand, like &#34;Penetrate and Patch&#34; <em><strong>if it was going to work, it would have worked by now</strong></em>. There have been numerous interesting studies that indicate that a significant percentage of users will trade their password for a candy bar, and the Anna Kournikova worm showed us that nearly 1/2 of humanity will click on anything purporting to contain nude pictures of semi-famous females. If &#34;Educating Users&#34; is the strategy you plan to embark upon, you should expect to have to &#34;patch&#34; your users every week. That&#39;s dumb. </p>
  <p>The real question to ask is not &#34;can we educate our users to be better at security?&#34; it is &#34;why do we need to educate our users at all?&#34; In a sense, this is another special case of &#34;Default Permit&#34; - why are users getting executable attachments at all? Why are users expecting to get E-mails from banks where they don&#39;t have accounts? Most of the problems that are addressable through user education are self-correcting over time. As a younger generation of workers moves into the workforce, they will come pre-installed with a healthy skepticism about phishing and social engineering.</p>
  <p>Dealing with things like attachments and phishing is another case of &#34;Default Permit&#34; - our favorite dumb idea. After all, if you&#39;re letting all of your users get attachments in their E-mail you&#39;re &#34;Default Permit&#34;ing anything that gets sent to them. A better idea might be to simply quarantine all attachments as they come into the enterprise, delete all the executables outright, and store the few file types you decide are acceptable on a staging server where users can log in with an SSL-enabled browser (requiring a password will quash a lot of worm propagation mechanisms right away) and pull them down. There are freeware tools like MIMEDefang that can be easily harnessed to strip attachments from incoming E-mails, write them to a per-user directory, and replace the attachment in the E-mail message with a URL to the stripped attachment. Why educate your users how to cope with a problem if you can just drive a stake through the problem&#39;s heart? </p>
  <p>When I was CEO of a small computer security start-up we didn&#39;t have a Windows system administrator. All of the employees who wanted to run Windows had to know how to install it and manage it <em>themselves</em>, or they didn&#39;t get hired in the first place.   My prediction is that in 10 years users that need education will be out of the high-tech workforce entirely, or will be self-training at home in order to stay competitive in the job market. My guess is that this will extend to knowing not to open weird attachments from strangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#6) Action is Better Than Inaction </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>IT executives seem to break down into two categories: the &#34;early adopters&#34; and the &#34;pause and thinkers.&#34; Over the course of my career, I&#39;ve noticed that <em>dramatically</em> fewer of the &#34;early adopters&#34; build successful, secure, mission-critical systems. This is because they somehow believe that &#34;Action is Better Than Inaction&#34; - i.e.: if there&#39;s a new whizzbang, it&#39;s better to install it <em>right now</em> than to wait, think about it, watch what happens to the other early adopters, and then deploy the technology once it&#39;s fully sorted-out and has had its first generation of experienced users. I know one senior IT executive - one of the &#34;pause and thinkers&#34; whose plan for doing a wireless roll-out for their corporate network was &#34;wait 2 years and hire a guy who did a successful wireless deployment for a company larger than us.&#34; Not only will the technology be more sorted-out by then, it&#39;ll be much, much cheaper. What an utterly brilliant strategy!</p>
  <p>There&#39;s an important corollary to the &#34;Action is Better Than Inaction&#34; dumb idea, and it&#39;s that:</p>
  <p>You can see the &#34;Action is Better Than Inaction&#34; dumb idea all over corporate networks and it tends to correlate with senior IT managers that make their product-purchasing decisions by reading Gartner research reports and product glossies from vendors. If you find yourself in the chain of command of such a manager, I sincerely hope you&#39;ve enjoyed this article because you&#39;re probably far better acquainted with dumbness than I am.</p>
  <p>One extremely useful piece of management kung-fu to remember, if you find yourself up against an &#34;early adopter&#34; is to rely on your peers. Several years ago I had a client who was preparing to spend a ton of money on a technology <em>without testing it operationally</em>. I suggested offhandedly to the senior IT manager in charge that he should send one of his team to a relevant conference (in this case, <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa05" target="_blank">LISA</a>) where it was likely that someone with hands-on experience with the technology would be in attendance. I proposed that the manager have his employee put a message on the &#34;meet and greet&#34; bulletin board that read:</p>
  <p>It really is easier to not do something dumb than it is to do something smart. The trick is, when you avoid doing something dumb, to make sure your superiors know you navigated around a particularly nasty sand-bar and that you get appropriate credit for being smart. Isn&#39;t that the ultimate expression of professional kung-fu? To get <strong><em>credit</em></strong> for <em><strong>not</strong></em> doing <em><strong>anything</strong></em>?!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Minor Dumbs</h2>
<p>These dumb ideas didn&#39;t quite merit status as &#34;The Dumb<em>est</em>&#34; ideas in computer security, but they&#39;re pretty dumb and deserve mention in passing:</p>
<div> 
  <ul>
    <li>&#34;We&#39;re Not a Target&#34; - <em>yes, you are</em>. Worms aren&#39;t smart enough to realize that your web site/home network isn&#39;t interesting.</li>
    <li>&#34;Everyone would be secure if they all just ran &lt;security-flavor-of-the-month&gt;&#34; - <em>no, they wouldn&#39;t</em>. Operating systems have security problems because they are complex and system administration is not a solved problem in computing. Until someone manages to solve system administration, switching to the flavor-of-the-month is going to be <em>more</em> damaging because you&#39;re making it harder for your system administrators to gain a level of expertise that only comes with time. </li>
    <li>&#34;We don&#39;t need a firewall, we have good host security&#34; - <em>no, you don&#39;t</em>. If your network fabric is untrustworthy every single application that goes across the network is potentially a target. 3 words: Domain Naming System.</li>
    <li>&#34;We don&#39;t need host security, we have a good firewall&#34; - <em>no, you don&#39;t</em>. If your firewall lets traffic through to hosts behind it, then you need to worry about the host security of those systems.</li>
    <li>&#34;Let&#39;s go production with it now and we can secure it later&#34; - <em>no, you won&#39;t</em>. A better question to ask yourself is &#34;If we don&#39;t have time to do it correctly now, will we have time to do it over once it&#39;s broken?&#34; Sometimes, building a system that is in constant need of repair means you will spend years investing in turd polish because you were unwilling to spend days getting the job done right in the first place.</li>
    <li>&#34;We can&#39;t stop the occasional problem&#34; - <em>yes, you can</em>. Would <em>you</em> travel on commercial airliners if you thought that the aviation industry took this approach with your life? I didn&#39;t think so. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Goodbye and Good Luck</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to keep this light-hearted, but my message is serious. Computer security is a field that has fallen far too deeply in love with the whizzbang-of-the-week and has forsaken common sense. Your job, as a security practitioner, is to question - if not outright challenge - the conventional wisdom and the status quo. After all, if the conventional wisdom was working, the rate of systems being compromised would be going <em><strong>down</strong></em>, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

      <title>SQLite Is Dynamically Typed (2020)</title>
      <link>https://blog.zachwf.com/posts/sqlite-is-dynamically-typed/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>A small, cool fact about SQLite is that its columns are flexibly typed. You can
store any value in any column! Try it out:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sqlite3">sqlite&gt; create table t1 (v1 int, v2 varchar(10));
sqlite&gt; insert into t1 values (&#34;abc&#34;, &#34;this string is longer than 10 characters!&#34;);
sqlite&gt; select * from t1;
abc|this string is longer than 10 characters!
sqlite&gt; select typeof(v1), typeof(v2) from t1;
text|text
</code></pre><p>The null type is still special:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sqlite3">sqlite&gt; create table t1 (v1 int, v2 varchar(10) NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t1 values (&#34;abc&#34;, NULL);
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: t1.v2
</code></pre><p>The longer story is that column definitions express a “type affinity” and SQLite
will try to do implicit conversions to match type affinity e.g. converting
strings of numeric characters to integers:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sqlite3">sqlite&gt; insert into t1 values(&#34;123&#34;, &#34;&#34;);
sqlite&gt; select typeof(v1) from t1;
integer
</code></pre><p>Lots of databases support the type conversion behavior, but SQLite can’t do the
conversion it powers through and writes the bytes anyways.</p>
<p>I’d be curious to hear more about how this type system came to be. It seems
trickier to implement, but potentially useful? And also potentially
anti-useful? Are there users who totally eschew column types and actually rely
on this behavior for correctness?</p>
<p>As always, the insanely great SQLite docs have a <a href="https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html">lot more
detail</a>.</p>

      <title>Facebook’s claims about the Ad Observer are wrong</title>
      <link>https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___blog_mozilla_org_en_mozilla_news_why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-66790">
  

  <div>
    
<p>Recently the Surgeon General of the United States <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf">weighed in</a> on the spread of disinformation on major platforms and its effects on people and society. He echoed the calls of researchers, activists and organizations, like Mozilla, for the major platforms to release <strong>more</strong> data, and to provide access to researchers in order to analyze the spread and impact of misinformation. </p>



<p>Yet Facebook has again taken steps to shut down this exact kind of research on its platform, a troubling pattern we have witnessed from Facebook including sidelining their own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">Crowdtangle</a> and killing a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools">suite of tools</a> from Propublica and Mozilla in 2019.  </p>



<p>Most recently, Facebook has <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/researchers-nyu-knight-institute-condemn-facebooks-effort-to-squelch-independent-research-about-misinformation">terminated the accounts</a> of New York University researchers that built Ad Observer, an extension dedicated to bringing greater transparency to political advertising that was critical for researchers and journalists during the presidential election. </p>



<p>Facebook claims the accounts were shut down due to privacy problems with the Ad Observer.  In our view, those claims simply do not hold water. We know this, because before encouraging users to contribute data to the Ad Observer, which we’ve done repeatedly, we reviewed the code ourselves. And in this blog post, we want to explain why we believe people can contribute to this important research without sacrificing their privacy.  </p>



<p>Anytime you give your data to another party, whether Facebook or Mozilla or researchers at New York University, it is important that you know whether that party is trustworthy, what data will be collected, and what will be done with that data. Those are critical things to consider before you potentially grant access to your data. And those are also key factors for Mozilla when we consider recommending an extension. </p>



<p>Before Mozilla decided to recommend Ad Observer, we reviewed it twice, conducting both a code review and examining the consent flow to ensure users will understand exactly what they are installing. In both cases the team responsible for this add-on responded quickly to our feedback, made changes to their code, and demonstrated a commitment to the privacy of their users. We also conducted an in-depth design review of Ad Observer, the results of which can be found <a href="https://bug1676407.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=9187255">here</a>. </p>



<p>We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency. It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads.<strong> It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers.</strong> The extension also allows you to see what data has been collected by visiting the “My Archive” tab. It gives you the choice to opt in to sharing additional demographic information to aid research into how specific groups are being targeted, but even that is off by default.</p>



<p>You don’t have to take our word for it. Ad Observer is open source, so anybody can see <a href="https://github.com/OnlinePoliticalTransparency/social-media-collector">the code</a> and  confirm it is designed properly and doing what it purports to do.</p>



<p>Of course, companies like Facebook need to be proactive about third-parties that might be collecting data on their platform and putting their users at risk. Figuring out what third-parties to allow under what circumstances is certainly not an easy task. But in this case, the application of its policy is counterproductive. This is why Mozilla makes <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/08/01/safe-harbor-for-security-bug-bounty-participants/">exceptions for good-faith security research</a> in our own products and why we have been supportive <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kfai-documents/documents/d6ebc73dd9/Facebook_Letter.pdf">of</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLcoINv_uMedadkMvp4ZUSLmayCLQZPKQcbiV1cnGXtpy_4Q/viewform">calls</a> for Facebook to create safe harbors for public-interest research. </p>



<p>The truth is that major platforms continue to be a safe haven for disinformation and extremism — wreaking havoc on people, our elections and society. We actually launched <a href="https://rally.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla Rally</a> to take back control of research from unresponsive platforms like Facebook. Telling the truth about misinformation needs consent, clarity and community, and businesses built on people’s data shouldn’t be scared of telling us what that data is used for. We’ve also pushed the industry through the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mozilla-letter-to-EU-Commission-on-Facebook-transparency-31-01-19-1.pdf">EU’s Code of Practice on Disinformation,</a>  <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/05/27/advancing-system-level-change-with-ad-transparency-in-the-eu-dsa/">encouraged</a> the European Commission to mandate disclosure of all advertisements on major platforms and encouraged users to contribute their data to Ad Observer. We need tools like Ad Observer to help us shine a light on the darkest corners of the web. And rather than standing in the way of efforts to hold platforms accountable, we all need to work together to support and improve these tools.</p>

          </div><p><span>Russian payment services company Xsolla has fired 150 employees at once. What caused controversy wasn’t the staff reduction itself but the CEO’s letter, in which he tried to explain the reason behind this decision.</span></p><div>
			      <p><a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xsolla-layoffs.png"></a></p>
<p><span>The email written by Xsolla CEO and founder Aleksandr Agapitov leaked on August 3. At first, some people suspected that it could have been fake, but its authenticity was later confirmed by some local game outlets and the company itself.</span></p>
<p><span>150 people were fired from the company’s office in Perm, Russia. Agapitov informed his employees that they were being let go via the letter saying that they have been terminated based on big data analysis of their activity.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the full translation of the email:</span></p>
<p><i><span>You received this email because my big data team analyzed your activities in Jira, Confluence, Gmail, chats, documents, dashboards and tagged you as unengaged and unproductive employees. In other words, you were not always present at the workplace when you worked remotely.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Many of you might be shocked, but I truly believe that Xsolla is not for you. Nadia and her care team partnered with seven leading HR agencies, as we will help you find a good place, where you will earn more and work even less. Sasha will help you get a recommendation, including the one from myself. And Natalia will read you your rights.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Once again, thank you for your contribution. If you want to stay in contact with me, please write me a long letter about all your observations, injustice, and gratitude.</span></i></p>
<p><span>In the end of the letter, Agapitov also shared a “list of those expelled.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xsolla-screen-letter.jpg"></a></p>
<p><span>Agapitov later</span><a href="https://app2top.ru/industry/xsolla-uvolila-okolo-150-sotrudnikov-kompaniya-ottalkivalas-ot-analiza-ih-aktivnosti-v-rabochih-prilozheniyah-188953.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>told App2Top.ru</span></a><span> that Xsolla sometimes has to take difficult and unpopular measures to keep growing and evolving. “We want all our employees to think daily about how their actions and decisions affect the company’s fate and success because we have very ambitious goals in the coming years; it is one of Xsolla’s values and it is reflected in everything — from operating standards to compensation system,” he said, adding that all employees will receive compensation packages and help from HR agencies.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, Xsolla faced backlash for what was perceived as secretly spying on its employees. Many people also criticized the letter’s tone.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Russian HR expert</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/alena.vladimirskaya/posts/10222434808431941" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>Alyona Vladimirskaya</span></a><span>, using big data and AI in HR shouldn’t violate employees’ rights. “Measuring employees’ performance by their network time and engagement rather than by digitized work results is both outdated and extremely ineffective,” she said, also advising the dismissed employees to sue the company for its actions.</span></p>

      <title>Does the Tuskegee Experiment Explain Black Vaccination Rates?</title>

<p>Black vaccination rates lag the rest of the country, according to data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html">Census Household Pulse Survey</a> and other similar sources.</p>



<figure><a href="https://mattbruenig.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.13.24-PM.png"></a></figure>



<p>One common explanation for this in the discourse is that black people are skeptical of the vaccine because of prior historical events in which they were abused and experimented upon by the US government and healthcare authorities. The main incident brought up in this explanation is the Tuskegee Experiment. In that experiment, black people with syphilis were told they were receiving drugs to treat the disease but they were actually given placebos while the researchers studied the effects of untreated syphilis.</p>



<p>This theory checks off certain boxes that make it resonate well within current discourse frameworks, but it doesn’t really make a lot of sense. If the coronavirus vaccines were <em>only</em> being given to black people, then you could see how someone might reason that it is a trick. But they are being given to everyone, including over 100 million white people. Are we meant to think that black people who aren’t getting the vaccine believe that the government is poisoning 100 million white people because the government has a racist history of poisoning black people? The racial analysis here would tell you that there is no way the white supremacist government would do such a thing and so the vaccine must be safe!</p>



<p>Perhaps more compelling than this abstract reasoning is the breakdown of the black vaccination rate by education level.</p>



<figure><a href="https://mattbruenig.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-8.13.30-PM.png"></a></figure>



<p>As with the population in general and every other racial group, black vaccination rates climb in lockstep with educational attainment. Educational attainment of course is also a decent proxy, on average, for income, wealth, and other socioeconomic indicators.</p>



<p>I would guess that awareness of the Tuskegee Experiment and black history more generally is greater among those with higher education than those with lower education. If this guess is right, then knowledge of historical racist medical abuses is actually strongly correlated with getting the vaccine.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I am bringing this up because it seems to me that this just-so story about black vaccine hesitancy is actually very unhelpful when it comes to trying to getting black people and the population more generally vaccinated. It’s soothing to a certain mindset that is prevalent in the discourse, but it’s totally detached from reality and papers over the much more significant socioeconomic factors.</p>

<p>Gosec can be configured to only run a subset of rules, to exclude certain file
paths, and produce reports in different formats. By default all rules will be
run against the supplied input files. To recursively scan from the current
directory you can supply <code>./...</code> as the input argument.</p>

<p>As with all automated detection tools, there will be cases of false positives. In cases where gosec reports a failure that has been manually verified as being safe,
it is possible to annotate the code with a <code>#nosec</code> comment.</p>
<p>The annotation causes gosec to stop processing any further nodes within the
AST so can apply to a whole block or more granularly to a single expression.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="
import &#34;md5&#34; // #nosec

}</pre></div>
<p>When a specific false positive has been identified and verified as safe, you may wish to suppress only that single rule (or a specific set of rules)
within a section of code, while continuing to scan for other problems. To do this, you can list the rule(s) to be suppressed within
the <code>#nosec</code> annotation, e.g: <code>/* #nosec G401 */</code> or <code>// #nosec G201 G202 G203</code></p>
<p>In some cases you may also want to revisit places where <code>#nosec</code> annotations
have been used. To run the scanner and ignore any <code>#nosec</code> annotations you
can do the following:</p>

<p>gosec currently supports <code>text</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>yaml</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>sonarqube</code>, <code>JUnit XML</code>, <code>html</code> and <code>golint</code> output formats. By default
results will be reported to stdout, but can also be written to an output
file. The output format is controlled by the <code>-fmt</code> flag, and the output file is controlled by the <code>-out</code> flag as follows:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Write output in json format to results.json
$ gosec -fmt=json -out=results.json *.go
"><pre><span><span>#</span> Write output in json format to results.json</span>
$ gosec -fmt=json -out=results.json <span>*</span>.go</pre></div>
<p>Results will be reported to stdout as well as to the provided output file by <code>-stdout</code> flag. The <code>-verbose</code> flag overrides the
output format when stdout the results while saving them in the output file</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Write output in json format to results.json as well as stdout

											<p><strong>A prevailing assumption, among firms and regulators alike, is that misconduct problems can be discovered only after they occur: a ‘detect and correct’ mindset. But we’re beginning to see the emergence of a ‘predict and prevent’ approach to managing conduct risk in organizations. </strong></p>
<p>In her landmark study into the causes of the 1986 space shuttle <em>Challenger</em> disaster, sociologist Diane Vaughan expected to find that NASA managers and engineers had violated established rules and processes. Instead, she found that the disastrous launch decision was arrived at through “conformity to cultural beliefs, organizational rules and norms, and NASA’s bureaucratic, political and technical culture.” She coined the phrase, “<a href="https://starlingtrust.com/thoughts/the-normalization-of-deviance.html">the normalization of deviance</a>,” to describe what had happened at NASA.</p>
<p>By “normalization” Vaughan meant that decision making processes and action choices that deviated from formal established rules were reinterpreted by work groups in a manner that allowed for those choices and actions to sit comfortably within the bounds of established performance norms. That is, “they redefined evidence that deviated from an acceptable standard so that it became the standard,” she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct &amp; Culture: Drivers of Financial Crime</strong></p>
<p>Vaughan emphasized the “social construction of risk” and this theme was heard clearly on 23 July in a <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/events/fraud-financial-crime-asia-2021/day-3/">panel discussion</a> on “Conduct &amp; Culture: Drivers of Financial Crime” hosted <em>Regulation Asia</em> as part of its Fraud &amp; Financial Crime Asia 2021 conference.</p>
<p>Panelists included Kate Miller, Head of Conduct &amp; Behavioural Analysis at Standard Chartered Bank; Jason Lee, Managing Director for Legal and Regulatory matters at Singapore sovereign wealth fund, Temasek; and Wendy Ennis, Head of Financial Crime Compliance at Mox Bank. The discussion was moderated by London School of Economics professor of organizational psychology, Tom Reader, who studies how norms and behaviors relating to risk management emerge within organizations and contribute to outcomes.</p>
<p>Reader’s current work investigates how organizations can better detect and respond to signals of impending and serious failure, proactively. In <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/organisational-culture-and-bank-risk">a paper</a> recently published by the Bank of England, he discusses the use of ‘unobtrusive data’ in the course of studying culture within organizations, and the conduct it promotes.</p>
<p>Opening the panel discussion, Reader observed that regulators, boards and management often focus on risk governance “inputs” – like formal value statements, training protocols, etc. – and then examine subsequent performance outcomes – or “outputs” – to see that the inputs performed as expected. Missing entirely is a study of organizational “throughputs,” or data that reflects a firm’s culture-in-action. It is here that we may discover a normalization of deviance.</p>
<p><strong>Probing Predilections</strong></p>
<p>Since the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis, Mox Bank’s Wendy Ennis observed, investigations by regulators and the media into misconduct scandals at financial firms, and subsequent regulatory actions, have placed an emphasis on the personal accountability of senior leaders for setting a firm’s culture and the behavioral predilections such cultures promote.  While this is important and perhaps necessary, Ennis argued that we need to dig deeper, by enquiring into values and beliefs as they operate at the individual and collective level.</p>
<p>Formal systems and processes for risk governance, Ennis noted, will fail to produce desired outcomes if not supported by an appropriate culture. While tone from the top is important in this regard, she allowed, “tone from the middle at least as important.” Firms must therefore maintain an atmosphere of “psychological safety” that encourages employees to speak up when they believe things have gone amiss.  That is, firms need to ensure that their employees will call-out deviance, rather than permit its normalization. Assessing cultural proclivities in this direction, Ennis argued, should be a management priority.</p>
<p>But Reader observed that culture is often viewed as being too “wooly” to submit to formal metrics – a view he clearly challenged. While Kate Miller at Standard Chartered agreed this argument is heard regularly, she argued that it does not withstand scrutiny.  Culture, Miller maintained, is both felt and seen day-to-day, and can therefore be observed and studied.  Because it is constantly evolving, culture must be studied in this real-time and lived-in context.  A mix of behavioral and data science has begun to make this possible, she noted, and banks like hers are beginning to trial the use of tools that leverage these approaches.</p>
<p>Temasek’s Jason Lee pointed out that a concern for culture measurement is not confined to the banking sector.  “Banks do not have a monopoly on bad behavior,” Lee noted, pointing to legal and regulatory action in other industries in the wake of countless corruption scandals.  In fact, he argued, probing culture for signs of potential misconduct may be <em>more </em>important in industries not subject to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny as that which prevails in the financial sector.</p>
<p><strong>‘Misconduct by design’</strong></p>
<p>Reader observed that people do things which they know to be wrong, but which they somehow didn’t think to be wrong at the time their action was taken.  This raises the question of ‘bad apples’ versus ‘bad barrels.’</p>
<p>Miller noted that humans are predominantly social beings and so, understood in that context, it is the barrel that matters. She remarked that, since 2008, we have focused on willful and intentional misconduct that tends to be individual in nature.  But what we continue to see day in and day out, Miller argued, is that the workplace environment may erect structural drivers of misconduct.  She called this “misconduct by design.”</p>
<p>A key difference in the behavior that is seen in banking as compared to other industries, Reader suggested, is that there is perhaps a greater readiness to take risk in finance.  Responding to this, Temasek’s Lee argued that there is nothing new in noting that people may at times face tension between meeting financial goals and doing what is required ethically.  How people navigate this tension is driven by firm culture, and this is true in banking and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Building on that view, Ennis argued that misconduct is not often malevolent in nature but, rather may reflect “a slip in standards.”  Covid has heightened the risk of such slippage, she said.  The use of technology tools in this context is therefore increasingly important, as is prioritizing discussion of such issues frankly and directly with workplace teams.  Reader referred to this as to “listening to the mood music of the organization,” and suggested that behavioral science had much to offer in this context.</p>
<p><strong>Managing from the front-foot</strong></p>
<p>Reader commented that it is much easier to pick up on errors of commission rather than errors of omission, pointing specifically to the normalization of deviance in this connection.  So how are we to make tell-tale signs of trouble concrete and actionable – before problems arise?</p>
<p>Temasek’s Lee argued that if culture is defined as the norms and values of an organization, such may be fairly seen as intangible in nature.  But if conduct is viewed as <em>reflective</em> of such norms and values, then such conduct may be taken as a highly tangible manifestation of organizational culture.  That is, we may be able to work backward from observable behavior to the underlying values and norms that promote it.</p>
<p>We focus on the manifestations of culture, Lee continued, arguing that this is perhaps but the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  With advancements in AI and machine learning, he argued, we can now get ‘beneath the surface’ and identify things that need proactive investigation and perhaps behavioral science interventions that shape “choice architecture” in ways that are helpful.</p>
<p>Ennis agreed, arguing that the standard tick-the-box checklist approach to risk governance is inadequate. However helpful, such checklists address only what is visible above the waterline. It is more important to delve deeper to learn how tone from the top is landing with staff, subjectively and qualitatively, “in real life.”</p>
<p>Here, Reader noted, firms may make productive use of the “mounds of data” that they already possess, with a view to identifying cultural nuances at work in real-time.  Miller built on this argument, calling the use of data in this context “the next generation of risk analysis.”  She pointed here to Reader’s work on the use of unobtrusive sources of data.</p>
<p>Advancements in AI create new capabilities for organizations to use their existing data differently, and to derive latent value from such.  Reader added that this may help to overcome a key limitation of traditional staff surveys: as culture worsens, people are less and less willing to speak up and, thus, survey responses become less and less reliable as a means of gauging culture. Going forward, Lee argued, measuring culture will involve multiple indicators and approaches to present a more holistic view of the firm.</p>
<p>Key areas of future focus will therefore be: (1) making better use of data with AI and machine learning tools that remove the anecdotal bias of mere “gossip,” (2) bringing key stakeholders into the effort, to include investors, government, the community that an organization seeks to serve; and (3) staff turnover – particularly in control functions – is an area that will receive closer attention, as such in and of itself may serve as an early indicator of pending problems.</p>
<p>In sum, while regulators and firms have in the past viewed misconduct risk as a problem that can only be addressed after harm is done, this ‘detect and correct’ mindset is being displaced rapidly by a ‘predict and prevent’ mindset.  Studying culture so as to anticipate trouble proactively positions management to operate from the front-foot: a capability that is increasingly expected.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Edge Experimenting with a Super Duper Secure Mode</title>
      <link>https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___microsoftedge_github_io_edgevr_posts_Super-Duper-Secure-Mode_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The VR team is experimenting with a new feature that challenges some conventional assumptions held by many in the browser community. Our hope is to build something that changes the modern exploit landscape and significantly raises the cost of exploitation for attackers. Mitigations have a long history of being bypassed, so we are seeking feedback from the community to build something of lasting value.</p><p>Most importantly we plan to have fun with this project. This includes giving the experiment a slightly provocative name because we think it is funny, and it is a bit too early for something official.</p><p>We bounce between offensive and defensive roles on this team quite often. When working on browser exploits, our favorite target is always V8. JavaScript engine bugs are a mainstay for attackers for a variety of reasons; they provide powerful exploit primitives, there is a steady stream of bugs, and exploitation of these bugs often follows a straightforward template. JavaScript engine exploitation has <a href="http://phrack.org/papers/attacking_javascript_engines.html">not changed much over the years</a> and generally follows the same pattern:</p><ul><li>Fake an object</li><li>Get AddrOf Primitive</li><li>Achieve arbitrary write</li></ul><p>We can effectively copy/paste our bug into a template and have something working fairly quickly. Attackers even have frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/theori-io/pwnjs">PwnJS</a> which allow for this quick conversion.</p><p>However, as a defender, this is a nightmare. The regular stream of bugs requires frequent security updates, and the ease of exploitation means attackers can quickly weaponize exploits, which is helpful when abusing the <a href="https://blog.exodusintel.com/2019/09/09/patch-gapping-chrome/">patch gap</a>. This problem is not unique to V8, this is a common problem among most modern JavaScript engines. Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and others try to mitigate this risk proactively with large investments in static analysis, bug bounties, and fuzzing. All of these allow for rapid identification of some of these issues, but inevitably, a number are missed. JavaScript engines remain a remarkably difficult security challenge for browsers.</p><p>Why? Well, the problem is in part due to a performance technology called “Just-In-Time Compilation” (JIT). JITs were introduced to browsers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey#TraceMonkey">2008</a> to speed up specific tasks in JavaScript. JIT-enabled engines effectively take loosely-typed JavaScript and compile it to machine code just before it is needed. This process is sometimes referred to as “speculative optimization.” JavaScript code is optimized through a series of complex processing pipelines. These changes result in performance gains that are quite impressive. Developers have managed to make JavaScript performance <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/algorithmic-performance-comparison-c-javascript-java-malyshev">comparable with C++</a>, which is an impressive feat. However, a lot goes into this process. To provide some perspective, here is a high-level overview from a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1lLsbclvzyOF3IUR05ZUaZcqDxo7_-8f4yJoxdMooU/edit#slide=id.p">V8 presentation</a> produced by Google in 2016.</p><p></p><p><sup>1</sup><sub><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1lLsbclvzyOF3IUR05ZUaZcqDxo7\_-8f4yJoxdMooU/edit#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H1lLsbclvzyOF3IUR05ZUaZcqDxo7_-8f4yJoxdMooU/edit#slide=id.p</a></sub></p><p>The above chart is just one phase of the entire V8 processing pipeline. This does not include the parsers, interpreter, the recently-added second JIT called <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug">Sparkplug</a>, or many other components. This is a remarkably complex process that very few people understand and it has a small margin for error.</p><p>Performance and complexity often come at a cost, and often we bear this cost in the form of security bugs and subsequent patches. Looking at CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data after 2019 shows that roughly 45% of CVEs issued for V8 were related to the JIT engine. Moreover, we know that attackers weaponize and abuse these bugs as well; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslzTx4b7sKZK4BR-DpO45JZNB1QZF9wuijK3OxBwr0/edit#gid=0">an analysis from Mozilla</a> shows that over half of the “in the wild” Chrome exploits abused a JIT bug, as illustrated in the charts below. Note “Edge” below refers to the legacy version of Edge.</p><p></p><p><sup>2</sup><sub> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslzTx4b7sKZK4BR-DpO45JZNB1QZF9wuijK3OxBwr0/edit#gid=865365202">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslzTx4b7sKZK4BR-DpO45JZNB1QZF9wuijK3OxBwr0/edit#gid=865365202</a> </sub></p><p>Traditionally, browser developers are willing to accept this cost because users want their browsers to be “fast” but what if we simply disabled the JIT? This reduction of attack surface has potential to significantly improve user security; <strong>it would remove roughly half of the V8 bugs that must be fixed</strong>. For users, this means less frequent security updates and fewer emergency patches required. These updates and patches are common points of frustration for our customers, particularly those in large enterprise environments who must test updates before rolling them out.</p><p>There are benefits beyond just attack surface reduction. Due to how the V8 JIT works, several impactful mitigation technologies cannot be brought to bear in the renderer process. For example, <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/technical-look-control-flow-enforcement-technology.html">Controlflow-Enforcement Technology</a> (CET), a new hardware-based exploit mitigation from Intel, was disabled. Similarly, Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) was not enabled due to the use of RWX memory pages in the process. This is unfortunate because the renderer process handles untrusted content and should be locked down as much as possible. By disabling JIT, we can enable both mitigations and make exploitation of security bugs in any renderer process component more difficult. Microsoft’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">Matt Miller laid out this strategy in early 2017</a>.</p><p></p><p>This reduction in attack surface kills half of the bugs we see in exploits and every remaining bug becomes more difficult to exploit. To put it another way, we lower costs for users but increase costs for attackers.</p><p>Performance is important to the Edge team, and we are quite proud of the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/04/edge-89-performance/">improvements we have made</a>. It is a complicated topic that includes a wide range of issues including startup time, memory consumption, rendering time and more. JavaScript plays a key role in any browser story. JITs exist for a reason and that is to optimize JavaScript performance.</p><p>We looked at the results of disabling the JIT in our lab. The Edge performance lab runs hundreds of tests that mimic real-world sites and conditions to look at the impact of a change. We group these tests into categories such as power, startup, memory, and page load. First, let’s look at how many tests saw an improvement, regression, or no change.</p><p></p><p>We see that most tests see no changes with JIT disabled. There are a few improvements and regressions, but most tests remain unchanged. <strong>Anecdotally, we find</strong> <strong>that users with JIT disabled rarely notice a difference in their daily browsing.</strong> But how much variation did we see in the tests that changed? The chart below shows the average percentage improvement or regression in performance.</p><p></p><p>We find that disabling the JIT does not always have negative impacts. Our tests that measured improvements in power showed 15% improvement on average and our regressions showed around 11% increase in power consumption. Memory is also a mixed story with negatively impacted tests showing a 2.3% regression, but a larger gain on the tests that showed improvements. Page Load times show the most severe decrease with tests that show regressions averaging around 17%. Startup times, however, have only a positive impact and no regressions.</p><p>It is important to note that these results do not include Speedometer 2.0, the most referenced benchmark. Disabling JIT does result in significantly lower scores in JavaScript benchmarks. Our tests showed a decline as high as 58%. However, often users do not notice this impact because this benchmark tells only part of a larger performance story.</p><p>So, are the performance gains provided by JIT worth the resulting security bugs, updates, and foregone security mitigations? The answer to that question is dependent on several factors. Are you viewing a blog or playing a game online? Are you visiting a trusted or untrusted site? As we continue our journey with this experiment, we will look to explore these factors and the impacts they can have on our users.</p><p>Over the next few months, we will try to answer these questions with our Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM) experiment. It will take some time, but we hope to have CET, ACG, and CFG protection in the renderer process. Once that is complete, we hope to find a way to enable these mitigations intelligently based on risk and empower users to balance the tradeoffs.</p><p>Currently, SDSM disables JIT (TurboFan/Sparkplug) and enables CET. At the moment, Web Assembly is not supported in this mode. We hope to slowly enable new mitigations and add Web Assembly support over the next few months as we continue testing and experimentation. You can find the feature under edge://flags in Edge Canary, Dev, and Beta.</p><p></p><p>This is of course just an experiment; things are subject to change, and we have quite a few technical challenges to overcome. Also, our tongue-in-cheek name will likely need to change to something more professional when we launch as a feature. For now, we are going to continue having fun with it.</p><p>If you decide to test the feature, please send us your feedback through the Feedback menu in Microsoft Edge. We are eager to hear about your experience.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Bay Area is undergoing some turmoil amidst the Occupy Wall Street movement and a series of disappearances and murders in the supernatural world, and Maya&#39;s pulled into the trouble and soon discovers that the city is looking for a sort of avatar to keep itself together. </p><p><em>Publishers Weekly</em> <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-78108-920-0">says</a> that the &#34;coexistence of a plethora of were-creatures makes for a delightful backdrop to Maya’s adventures.

      <title>Facebook let fossil-fuel industry push climate misinformation, report finds</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/facebook-fossil-fuel-industry-environment-climate-change</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p>Facebook failed to enforce its own rules to curb an oil and gas industry misinformation campaign over the climate crisis during last year’s presidential election, according to a new analysis released on Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://influencemap.org/EN/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-a40c8116160668aa2d865da2f5abe91b)" data-link-name="in body link">The report</a> by the London-based thinktank InfluenceMap identified an increase in advertising on the social media site by ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies aimed at shaping the political debate about policies to address global heating.</p><p>InfluenceMap said its research shows the fossil-fuel industry has moved away from outright denying the climate crisis, and is now using social media to promote oil and gas as part of the solution. The report also exposed what it said was Facebook’s role in facilitating the dissemination of false claims about global heating by failing to consistently apply its own policies to stop erroneous advertising.</p><p>“Despite Facebook’s public support for climate action, it continues to allow its platform to be used to spread fossil-fuel propaganda,” the report said. “Not only is Facebook inadequately enforcing its existing advertising policies, it’s clear that these policies are not keeping pace with the critical need for urgent climate action.”</p><p>The report found that 25 oil and gas industry organisations spent at least $9.5m to place more than 25,000 ads on Facebook’s US platforms last year, which were viewed more than 431m times. Exxon alone spent $5m.</p><p>“The industry is using a range of messaging tactics that are far more nuanced than outright statements of climate denial. Some of the most significant tactics found included tying the use of oil and gas to maintaining a high quality of life, promoting fossil gas as green, and publicizing the voluntary actions taken by the industry on climate change,” the report said.</p><p>The report noted a rise in spending on Facebook ads in July 2020, immediately after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $2tn climate plan to promote the use of clean energy. The spending remained high until after the election four months later.</p><p>“This suggests the oil and gas industry uses Facebook advertising strategically and for politically motivated purposes,” the report said.</p><p>InfluenceMap said it found 6,782 energy industry ads on Facebook last year promoting claims that natural gas is a green or low carbon fuel, even though research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says otherwise.</p><p>The research found that Exxon in particular used the social media site to push continued use of oil as affordable, reliable and important to keep the US from relying on other countries for its energy supply.</p><p>InfluenceMap also accused the company of running misleading ads that sought to shift the greater responsibility for cutting carbon emissions from industry to the lifestyle choices of ordinary Americans. The report said that the International Energy Agency calculates that global targets to reduce emissions rely heavily on the energy industry moving to green technologies, while just 8% of reductions will come from consumer choices such as taking fewer flights.</p><p>“These messages are often packaged in adverts promoting the climate-friendliness of oil and gas companies and the necessity of oil and gas for maintaining a high quality of life,” the report said.</p><p>InfluenceMap also drew attention to the part played by industry-funded groups led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/19/big-oil-climate-crisis-lobby-group-api" data-link-name="in body link">the American Petroleum Institute</a>, which spent $3m on Facebook ads last year portraying fossil-fuel companies as climate-friendly.</p><p>InfluenceMap said that while Facebook removed some ads for making false claims or failing to include a disclaimer identifying them as about environmental politics, it permitted many others to go unchallenged.</p><p>Facebook told the Guardian it has taken action against some groups running pro- fossil-fuel ads and that multiple advertisements have been rejected because they were run without being identified as political.</p><p>“We reject ads when one of our independent factchecking partners rates them as false or misleading, and take action against pages, groups, accounts, and websites that repeatedly share content rated as false,” said a Facebook spokesperson.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07.15.2020%20Letter%20from%20Sens.%20Warren,%20Carper,%20Whitehouse,%20&amp;%20Schatz%20to%20Mr.%20Zuckerberg.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">a group of US senators wrote to Mark Zuckerberg,</a> Facebook’s chief executive, about concerns that the social media platform was permitting demonstrably false claims about the climate crisis to be posted on the grounds they were ‘opinion’.</p><p>“Given Facebook’s long and troubling history with disinformation, it is deeply concerning that Facebook has now determined that climate disinformation is reportedly “immune to fact-checking”, said the senators, including Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>“The climate crisis is too important to allow blatant lies to spread on social media without consequence.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@astroteller?source=post_page-----f4ba55602e17--------------------------------" rel="noopener"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="d732"><em>10 years of moonshot taking</em></p><p id="cdf7">10 years ago Larry, Sergey, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun" rel="noopener">Sebastian</a> offered me the chance to run a grand experiment — to build a moonshot factory. Initially we only had a fuzzy idea about exactly what X was going to do, but we knew we wanted to create an organization that could invent and launch breakthrough technologies that would make the world a radically better place. And we knew X could play an important role for Google, in reaching beyond its core Internet business and beating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma" rel="noopener">innovator’s dilemma</a>. I agreed to co-found X because I’ve always wanted to create an organization that could repeatedly generate breakthrough innovations filled with hyper-creative people and weird, out-there thinking.</p><p id="abc0">What motivated me then is what motivates me now: humanity is choosing to keep much of its potential off the table, undeployed, and underutilized. Many people go to work at jobs that aren’t designed to be fulfilling, and many more don’t get the chance to contribute at all. Meanwhile, many powerful organizations are forced to focus on their own profitability and short term goals at the expense of everything else — leaving the status quo intact, or at best only making the world incrementally better. Yet the massive problems facing us this century need the widest array of minds, the wildest imaginations, and enormous commitments of time, resources, and attention.</p></div></div><div><figure><figcaption><em>The moonshot journey</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p id="8937">X as a whole is our prototype solution to this need. We’ve been trying to make a factory for radical ideas, technologies, and businesses that will have a huge positive impact, and for employees who maximize their creativity, talent, and personal sense of purpose. And we hope to prove that “good for the world” can be financially rewarding, so that more organizations are inspired to operate like this. 10 years into this experiment, we’re proud of our work so far, whether it’s the many <a href="https://x.company/projects/" rel="noopener">standalone companies and Google products that started at X</a> or the hundreds of alumni who carry X DNA into many different companies and industries. That said, there’s still more we can do.</p><p id="9658">As we hit our 10th anniversary, I’ve been taking stock of how we’re doing at building an organization that unleashes radical creativity while remaining relentlessly focused on real technologies and real-world impact. What I’ve come to realize is that our main cultural battle is against fear and the strong gravitational pull toward conventional ways of thinking and behaving. All of us have been conditioned for years not to fail, not to be vulnerable, and to minimize risk. So my number one job is helping Xers reset and free themselves from these invisible but pernicious constraints so they can free up their potential. And it’s a mission I want more leaders to take on, so below are some of the lessons we’ve learned about helping teams break away from the ordinary and into the unexpected and unknown.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption>An early Project Wing prototype</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="f070"><strong>#1 Stop thinking you can predict the future. </strong>This is one of the biggest myths perpetuated by investors, media, and the entire “futurist” industry; no one is much better than random at knowing what businesses and products will succeed in the long run. Our approach: Try audacious things and figure out as quickly as you can when you’re wrong.</p><p id="15bb">It’s possible to predict general territories where new opportunities are more likely to lie; for example, we think machine learning has the opportunity to unlock moonshot-sized opportunities in areas like agriculture, drug discovery, and the development of new materials. But you actually have to jump in and start trying things in order to get the details of that “Ah-ha!” breakthrough right. Sometimes you learn some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-glass-predicted-the-future/" rel="noopener">harsh lessons</a>; that’s the point. Sometimes it takes dozens of iterations; one team at X right now is working on improving how people hear, and they explored 35 different ideas before they found the one we’re going to pour fuel on.</p><p id="4214"><strong>#2 Take a long term view — it changes everything. </strong>We’ve deliberately chosen to work on hard problems whose answers are 5–10 years over the horizon. This gives us space to explore and experiment and learn more deeply. Taking the long view also enables us to think through the implications not just the applications of what we’re building, and ensure we’re taking into account the needs of many different people affected by any new technology. For example, we decided to tackle the longer, harder path of creating fully self-driving cars instead of launching a partially autonomous “freeway assistant” feature, because we wanted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArYTxDZzQOM" rel="noopener">help people who couldn’t drive at all</a> and make roads as safe as possible. By thinking long term, we can optimize individual projects and our portfolio for as much positive impact as possible, even if we can’t know exactly which bets will work out in a big way.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption>Early tests of our self driving car</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="1b15"><strong>#3 Carve out space for creative and weird souls. </strong>Willy Wonka had to build a chocolate factory to house the Oompa Loompas, because they struggled to survive in the wild. And innovators and dreamers often can’t thrive in typical organizations. Their constant “what ifs” and “why does it have to be this ways” can be irritating for organizations trying to lock in an execution plan and meet quarterly targets. As a result, their creative spirit is slowly bent over time to serve the status quo, or they leave, maybe branded as troublemakers (ironically, this often happens when the bosses hire “innovation consultants”). Don’t get me wrong — execution matters, especially when you’re operating at scale. But radical innovation needs a different cultural environment than product delivery does. That’s why X was set up away from Google. It’s why our moonshot projects leave X once the focus shifts from experimentation and prototyping to shipping products reliably and scaling a business.</p></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption>Save the Oompa Loompas!</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8d2a"><strong>#4 Dream like a child, test like a grownup</strong>. You can get way further than you think just by being optimistic enough to try. You’d be surprised how many people find motivation and joy in a ridiculously hard problem, especially if it has a magical-sounding solution. This is why we’ve <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/" rel="noopener">often said</a> that 10X can actually be easier than 10%. Before it seemed possible, teams at X believed in the possibility of self-driving cars, self-flying delivery drones, and stratospheric Internet-beaming balloons, and now all of these things are becoming real. We choose to see the world differently and keep our child-like sense of wonder and boundless opportunity. At the same time, we hold on to our skepticism as we run tests and learn to look dispassionately at the results, so we’re ready to change course or walk away when that is the right thing to do.</p><p id="2f3c"><strong>#5 Look for holy s**t moments — they can get you further than clear objectives. </strong>We send our projects off to explore new spaces without heavily quantified goals because we want them feeling free to find the intriguing paths that lead to the biggest surprises. But it’s hard to resist the allure of a clear milestone because humans dislike uncertainty and viscerally feel the downsides of failure far more easily than we can imagine the rewards of transformative success. To counteract this, we tell teams we want them to try a bunch of experiments and come back when they’ve found something that makes us say “holy s**t.” A robot navigates up to a table and uses its arm to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-the-everyday-robot-project-27860f3461a4">grasp and sort recyclables from trash</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.wired.com/video/watch/astro-teller-captain-of-moonshots-at-x-speaks-at-wired25" rel="noopener">four-wheeled buggy</a> rolls through a field, targeting and zapping weeds with a laser. These aren’t products — but they are demonstrations from a couple of our current projects of new technical capabilities that are harbingers of their ability to do even more interesting things with robotics and in agriculture in the future.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption><em>The computational agriculture team tests in the field</em></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="4849"><strong>#6 Cultivate the ability to be passionately dispassionate. </strong>While we can’t predict the future, we’re trying to invent it efficiently, to maximize the impact of our effort and resources. So it’s absolutely necessary to be intellectually honest and kill things that are pretty good (even if we love them!) so we can move on to <em>even</em> <em>better</em> opportunities. It’s something we keep trying to get better and faster at, though it’s deeply unnatural. It’s never easy to kill projects. Over the years we’ve had to disband dozens of teams and walk away from hundreds of gorgeous ideas, including <a href="https://x.company/projects/foghorn/" rel="noopener">a carbon-neutral fuel made from seawater</a>.</p><p id="50a3">Entrepreneurs who are charging passionately toward their vision often need to be coached to pop their heads up regularly and switch their mindset to dispassionately assess their situation. Sometimes people say to us, “You have to keep going at this because no one else will.” But that misses the point. Yes, we want to invest in far-out technologies with huge promise when they’re still so risky no one else will. At some point, though, once we’re satisfied that the technology has been somewhat de-risked, we need to test its commercial viability. If the market is as excited about it as we are, other companies will put money into it too, and we’ll keep going. But if they won’t, then maybe we’ve been kidding ourselves, and we should walk away and redirect our time, resources, and talent to more promising solutions.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption><em>One of Project Loon’s earliest prototypes</em></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="4e67"><strong>#7 Create fearless teams of </strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/if-your-innovation-effort-isnt-working-look-at-whos-on-the-team" rel="noopener"><strong>chaos pilots</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The lone inventor having a eureka moment is largely a myth; innovation comes from great teams. This doesn’t mean innovation by committee or consensus. It’s about committing to working together and having each other’s back, because where we’re going, we know it’s going to be dark and bumpy a lot of the time. We deliberately assemble teams from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures, and communities, so we can generate more creative ideas and ask hard questions. Former <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.x.company/robotics-is-a-team-sport-4bf2edd65871">rocket scientists work alongside concert pianists and puppeteers</a>, and marine biologists mingle with physicists and machine learning experts. Above all, we work hard to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their views and loves running toward really hard problems precisely because they’re difficult.</p></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p></p></div><figcaption><em>Xers cheering a successful “rocket launch” during our celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing</em></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="91e8"><strong>Engineering a cultural moonshot</strong></p><p id="ff04">X is a moonshot in and of itself, but unlike most things at X, our breakthrough idea isn’t a technology. It’s our people. It’s about engineering a culture and designing an organization that can overcome the powerful forces that cause humans to retreat to the comfortable and conventional. These forces stifle any efforts to innovate and problem-solve in more than an incremental way. So I’m committed to finding a set of practices, like the ones above, that help many individuals and organizations reset ourselves so audacious, purpose-driven, team-oriented collaboration can become the path of least emotional resistance — and therefore the path to solving the many challenges facing the 21st century.</p><p id="e0ac"><em>Editor’s note: we’d love to hear your tips, thoughts, and questions in the comments field, and we’ll try to address some of them in a future blog.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>A</span></span><span>s I prepared to write this piece, my three-year-old cat, Larry, had been missing for 24 hours. I had checked under the bins, posted in a community Facebook group and Googled variations of “Lost cat how long normal before come home?” all day. </span></p><p>Larry was a house cat when we took him in, but my boyfriend and I had recently moved to a house with a garden so had started letting him out. Just like that, our adorable, loving, docile cat turned into the neighbourhood bruiser. He stopped snuggling with us in the morning, instead impatiently pawing at the door even before we had put down his breakfast.</p><p>At night, we would search the house for him, before giving up and going to bed. “I’m sure he’ll be back … soon,” I said to my boyfriend, with all the confidence of a mother whose teenager was out after curfew. All night, I would toss and turn, wondering if I would see his little pink nose again.</p><p>Cats demand our love freely, on their own terms, which means with no expectation of long-term commitment. The average outdoor cat may visit multiple homes assessing each on the quality of their cuddles and treats. Some experts believe that cats are, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/are-cats-domesticated" data-link-name="in body link">at best, semi-domesticated</a>, meaning that at any moment, they could flounce off and do just fine.</p><p>I grapple with this reality. I watch Larry sometimes and think: “I love you so much, and one day, you might leave me.” Any cat-owner knows the exquisite torture of having a free-roaming pet. Their travels remain a mystery, hinted at only by a clump of dust in their whiskers, or a streak of paint in their fur.</p><p>Eventually, of course, Larry swaggered home, weary from another adventure on the savannah (Lewisham, south London). Where had he been? What was he doing out there? What do our cats get up to, when their humans are not around?</p><p>To answer this, I contacted <a href="https://tractive.com/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJqHBhC4ARIsAChq4at30oTHnBdI1ixDNMNhUmzJhmfYpwIpSTNbgJ5_rEilBN4gvSohL0kaAhc6EALw_wcB" data-link-name="in body link">Tractive</a>, manufacturers of GPS trackers for cats and dogs. It kindly volunteered to provide me with some units. Next, I recruited five cat owners, all curious to know about what their charges are up to when out and about. </p><h2>Meet the cats </h2><p>(Feel free here to imagine a slow-motion montage from a Guy Ritchie film, voiced by Ray Winstone):</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: a bossy, two-year-old shorthair from Brixworth, Northamptonshire. Pablo is owned by Andrea Franklin, a 52-year-old sales manager.</p><p><strong>Bluebell</strong>: a British shorthair blue from Buckfastleigh, Devon, who purrs like an engine, loves frozen Lick-e-Lix treats, and went missing for three days last year, leaving her owner, 70-year-old retired personal assistant Diane Powell, distraught. “She’s never naughty on purpose,” Powell says.</p><p><strong>Marina</strong>: a vocal, four-year-old tabby from Acton, west London, who is the terror of the neighbourhood. “Sometimes the neighbours say on Facebook that Marina is bullying the other cats,” says her owner, Ahmed el Bouhy, a 17-year-old student.</p><figure id="3a26905a-534e-4eab-b3fa-558ad1872939"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=48bf3f3ab5296826a1338214268babf0 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a9387aa632797d9ff14b4b49363b1170 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=c52bcf30b514a88fbd835588112508d5 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=09d3925ac097c95a8684ba9b4cd524fe 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=9457ebc562124c0b1910a86bd093db98 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9a7104cbbd72f7fac895eafc998ba131 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=69617cf76431884f601454da916e6c8c 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=edd042c867895f0d69bad2a2c4faa725 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=301673afe6556fbaf7a0170391e832a3 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f3d5695f6cd39637eba932a466336c20f2b345/0_0_4161_5784/master/4161.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7b91961ed07d2bed39385e51b14bad03 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Ndah Tatani Mbawa, her three daughters and their cat, Zaki.</span> Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Zaki</strong>: a free-spirited, two-year-old ragdoll, who three times has got stuck up a tree in the garden of his owner, Ndah Tatani Mbawa, 43, a business analyst from Northampton. “The first time the tree surgeon charged £180 to get him down,” sighs Mbawa. “The second time was £160. The third time my husband climbed the tree himself.”</p><p><strong>Pisi</strong>: a muscular serial killer from Hartwell, Northamptonshire. He once disappeared for three months, before turning up alive and well in a nearby forest. “Most days he catches something,” says his owner, Will Benzie, a 49-year-old IT manager. “Mice, birds. Once a pretty sizable rabbit.”</p><p>And finally, <strong>Larry</strong>: the most phenomenally handsome cat in existence, and a good boy at that.</p><p>It’s time to see what they get up to.</p><hr/><h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2><p>“He’s crossing the track,” I text my boyfriend with the green vomit-face emoji. I live behind a busy railway track – trains run pretty much constantly into central London, including high-speed freight trains – but the track is about 30ft up from ground level. I didn’t think Larry could climb that high. He can.</p><p>“The prime cause of death in cats under one is being run over,” warns John Bradshaw, the author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/14/cat-sense-john-bradshaw-review" data-link-name="in body link">Cat Sense: The Feline Enigma Revealed</a>. Larry is also crossing streets around my house, although he does not go further than a few hundred metres in each direction, endlessly looping my home like a security guard patrolling a shopping centre. This is likely to be because I live in a densely populated neighbourhood with other cats. “Many cats will self-limit how far they go,” says Bradshaw. “They don’t like challenging other cats or being challenged.”</p><p>Cats are territorial, with established patches they defend. “Territory is <em>the </em>most important thing to cats,” says cat behaviourist <a href="http://www.catbehaviourist.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Anita Kelsey</a>. “Some will chase off other cats, and some can live peacefully. Cats learn to share space and avoid one another to make it work, as it can be damaging to be fighting all the time.”</p><p>By limiting himself to the area directly around my house, Larry, it seems, is a lover, rather than a fighter. The same, however, cannot be said for Pablo. “He’s travelled four and a half miles,” says a flabbergasted Franklin. “I genuinely thought he’d just be sitting in some old lady’s living room all day.” Far from it. “There’s an allotment near our house,” she says. “He’s in there a lot. And then he goes into different gardens. He seems to have a few hang-out spots. I think he has a crew.”</p><hr/><h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2><p>Pablo is getting more brazen, crossing a busy A-road into a country park. “It’s notorious for speeding there,” Franklin says. </p><figure id="ea771951-29b1-4b52-85a3-95a8838b0bad"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6931dd604261be0450aac3abb4abd9e5 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=ae124aafec0e71f4de72c257e988bb23 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=ae45d0cbf0dc4930a4af1e5ea42487a8 890w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=08e6c83c3f9d935129925e3dc25f3bce 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=16ad53eea9e6e931fde0dfd8c3bdafbe 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5527687d815431b4ec997a1f39973d74fde3f01/0_0_640_480/master/640.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4321b4e646dc5cddaa782c1c10bbd7f8 445w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Brazen ... Pablo.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Franklin believes it’s wrong to keep Pablo indoors. “It’s important for him to be able to go and do what comes naturally to him,” she says. “Not to judge people who don’t let their cats out. With that comes the anxiety of losing him. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it’s like letting your kids get more independent. You have to let them go at some point.”</p><p>In this view, in the UK, Franklin is in the majority. Unlike in the US, where domesticated cats typically stay indoors, in the UK <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/get-involved/our-campaigns/pdsa-animal-wellbeing-report" data-link-name="in body link">just 26% of British cats are indoor-only</a>, according to the animal charity PDSA.</p><p>Not everyone is enamoured of this. “There is an anti-cat lobby,” says Bradshaw. “They are very vocal people. People who enjoy their gardens and allotments get seriously fed up with cat crap everywhere,” he says. </p><p>Then there’s the hunting. “Predation and hunting are natural attributes of cats,” says Prof Robbie McDonald, an expert in companion animal ecology at the University of Exeter. “Although a lot of individual cats don’t go anywhere near wildlife; it’s a minority.” (Larry won’t even kill a spider, much to my chagrin.)</p><p>The RSPB <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/gardening-for-wildlife/animal-deterrents/cats-and-garden-birds/are-cats-causing-bird-declines/" data-link-name="in body link">says there</a> is “no clear scientific evidence” that cats are causing bird populations to decline, but there is a perception among some British bird-lovers that cats are a menace and should be kept indoors. (In countries where cats are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/15/keep-pet-cats-indoors-say-researchers-who-found-they-kill-230m-native-australian-animals-each-year" data-link-name="in body link">not a native species</a>, such as Australia and New Zealand, they can have a devastating impact on wildlife.)</p><p>“I do feel that cats are an easy target,” says Bradshaw. “Skyscrapers kill more birds than cats do. But you don’t see people standing outside the factories where glass is made, saying: ‘You’re bird-killers.’”</p><hr/><h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2><p>Marina has been on rambunctious form. “She’s been harassing a few neighbours for food,” says El Bouhy. “Then went to a nearby construction site, and spent the night there.” El Bouhy, seeing her location on the Tractive app, went to collect her. “There was a guy on his break, petting her,” he says. “It took a bit of time to get her back.”</p><figure id="d400b180-cde4-4d29-8a70-334a748b0a07"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=573c3f22de45d7c74425668ee17a9756 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e39391572dc4dfe4ee852126e60fd614 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=f6a1386c21f494dda09fe15708e2fca2 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=80e71d8bf509470312610b92f8d403f8 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=806cbd3f38d49434c9a5b75e58073d7e 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c3873543db101b51b5a970492b9304aa 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6c876eec5eba72512fa46b6a52cd1285 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=be6e42d6435480c19b531b2f48a8412d 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=241752c1895cb2b18d1565b05288d9ce 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26704a9734d8bd1b22fe262e060ff0d83849f290/0_0_1715_2287/master/1715.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e1498032639f00185fd6de084b407bdb 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Rambunctious ... Marina.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over in Brixworth, Pablo’s hunting has ramped up. “This morning he went out without breakfast,” says Franklin. “He’s obviously getting his food somewhere else.” She watched in real time as Pablo spent the morning hunting in the allotments near her house. “He nipped home at lunch and brought a dormouse with him.”</p><p>There are ways to mitigate a cat’s impact on the local bird and small-mammal population. “If the cat is under your management – I hesitate to say control, because no one really controls a cat – you can work out ways to reduce the propensity of the cat to kill,” says McDonald. Bells on collars work, as does <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31896-0" data-link-name="in body link">switching cats on to a premium, high-protein food diet</a>, and giving them mental stimulation by playing with them in the morning. “Changing the cat’s food can reduce the amount of wildlife they kill by over a third,” says McDonald. “And playing with your cat, more than a quarter. These are positive actions for the cat that also have a positive outcome on their behaviour.”</p><p>In Buckfastleigh, Powell watches as Bluebell patrols a supermarket car park a few hundred metres from her house. “Like the car park attendant,” Powell says, amused. Shift finished, Bluebell prowls the streets looking for attention. “She’s spending a lot of time mooching around the back of houses,” says Powell. “Sometimes she goes in, to have a sleep on their sofa. And there’s a wall along the back of the houses where she spends a lot of time sitting, waiting for people to stroke her.”</p><hr/><h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2><p>One wily cat has slipped his collar. “I came out of the house and her collar was on the gate post,” says Benzie. “I feel like that’s a message from Pisi. Stop tracking me.”</p><p>All the cat-owners, or “guardians”, as Kelsey calls them, have rapidly become addicted to following their cats on the app, myself included. “It’s so time-consuming,” Franklin complains. “I’ll be trying to work and then I think: <em>‘</em>Ooh, I wonder what he’s doing.’”</p><p>Knowing where Pablo will be at any given time of the day is reassuring. “The allotments are clearly his mainstay,” Franklin says. “Now, when we drive past the allotments, I look in and see him. I never worry about him, because I know where he’ll be.”</p><figure id="f68d5c1d-0bb7-4acc-a82d-2e13c9baae94"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=a9d8154c475b42172e768366c3396bb0 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=620d0fe309bb7ff0e041339571f923ef 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=8353a7889c80774fd5bc7070255ad69f 890w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=dd0bf32e04793a3a370d98986e3b1c83 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=489580cd17d669c04c19e7fd55affda3 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84ff42f1d7e2c9c2bbfb24363a123fa79b58d6e/0_0_6093_3913/master/6093.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4942a73b3df6ce5a12b4fc5c1fa94b64 445w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>Will Benzie and his cat Pisi.</span> Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Benzie has long suspected that Pisi frequents a working coal yard about 100 metres from his house, “because his legs were black when he came back”. But the app shows that Pisi is also rifling around the coal sheds. “I don’t know if there are mice in there,” says Benzie.</p><p>Powell has been analysing Bluebell’s tracking data and noticed something unexpected. “If we go out of the house,” she says, referring to herself and her partner, “she comes in. It’s almost like she’s looking after the house for us.”</p><p>Mbawa is using her newfound knowledge of Zaki’s whereabouts to steal a march on her wayward pet. After seeing on the tracker that Zaki often visited the grounds of a local care home, she decided to walk down. “I saw him between some bushes and he looked at me and was shocked,” she says. “We looked at each other for a while, and he was embarrassed. He was scratching on a little tree and then he walked off … he looked as if he’d been found out.”</p><hr/><h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2><p>In Hartwell, Benzie has observed Pisi spending an unlikely amount of time in his neighbour’s back garden. “I went and asked her: ‘Have you been putting food out?’” Benzie says. “She smiled and said: ‘Yes, I’ve been putting it out back, so you can’t see it.’” Benzie also suspects that Pisi is getting a third, or even fourth, daily meal from the occupants of a row of houses about a mile away – after his morning visit to the coal yard, Pisi tends to wind up there in the afternoon. </p><figure id="7f19e021-addf-4a49-a0aa-71b251956c50"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=30fd0d3c5c6ab63d3aee8063c3878742 760w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=d3f82734418e3d984ce19bf15dd02156 600w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=84f8d1b358436701c5f59bcea478edf2 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e9773be77189e1288a18a437cae9e381 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=04b4c2f02ef391880bb74be6774ec186 890w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=be5fcb3cdcbc84aa1dd1fdf3318aed59 380w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8c5a9eea58095810b8452e3160d3f37 300w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=93cc33ecfdc419c8c5667c51f6bfa3cb 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6bbecb1b0b9d176b4aed596a1c989092 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00761712a2f139acd8f8adb57912e1e3f50d47b0/0_145_1200_1455/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=810072e47db46a2e867f50b0b4833d49 445w" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="11" height="10" viewBox="0 0 11 10"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.5 0L11 10H0z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Never naughty on purpose’ ...

Cats, for their part, welcome this attention. “Friendly, confident cats will explore other people’s homes and might beg for food from various houses on a set route,” says Kelsey. When Bradshaw was consulted on a pioneering 2012 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xcvhw" data-link-name="in body link">Horizon documentary</a> that tracked cats, he found it was commonplace for cats to be fed multiple times a day. “There was one cat that had four owners,” he says. “Cats are opportunists.”</p><p>But what makes perfect strangers so inclined to feed other people’s cats?</p><p>“We tend to look at ourselves in very recent contexts,” says McDonald. “But our relationship with cats goes back to the dawn of civilisation really. When humans started farming, we created surpluses of grain and stored them, and cats were used to protect the grain stores from rodents. The inclination to live closely with, accommodate and, in some cases, admire and befriend these animals is part of what makes people social. It’s a very profound relationship between people and this sort of animal.”</p><p>No one is seducing my cat today. It’s raining, so Larry doesn’t leave my side.</p><p>All of the cat owners have come to realise the adorable pets that sleep at the foot of their beds and snuggle on their laps during films are actually independent beings with habits and routines of their own. In short, they are autonomous creatures, with personalities, fears, preferences, needs and, dare I say it, souls.</p><p>“She gets up to a lot more than I thought she does,” says El Bouhy of Marina. “I knew she went to the neighbours occasionally, but I didn’t think she spent the whole day going into their gardens, harassing them for food, and even crossing the railway by my house. I thought she spent half an hour going around, and then slept the rest of the day.”</p><p>Benzie has been so intrigued by Pisi’s behaviour, he plans to fit a miniature camera to her collar. “You think it’s kind of lovely that they’re going so far and doing all this stuff,” he says. “But now it makes me want to delve a bit deeper to see why.”</p><p>As I write this, Larry is sitting next to me, watching me type. His nose rests on his paw. Although I have loved watching him perambulate around my south London home like a dowager countess, I’ve relegated Larry’s tracking device to a drawer.</p><p>Let him go. If he wants to come back to me, he will.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ever wondered how much data web giants generate? Grab says 1.7MB/user/day</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Singapore-based mega-app Grab has revealed that it generates 40TB of data a day. All that data is clearly valuable: Grab has also announced record profits.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian company, which bought out Uber in Singapore and since expanded into e-commerce, payments, and financial services, did not disclose what it does with the data, nor how it is protected. But it did <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.grab.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ir/investor-presentation.pdf">disclose</a> [PDF] that it has 23.8 million monthly transacting customers, who collectively generated a record US$507 million adjusted net sales in its first quarter, boasting that the company saw a 39 per cent increase in adjusted net sales despite a COVID-related hit to its mobility services.</p>
<p>The company told <i>The Register</i> that not all of that 40TB of daily data is generated by customers - millions of drivers and other partners also contribute. Doing the math on the user/data ratio is still interesting.</p>

    

<p>Grab also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/strong-first-quarter-2021-results/">claimed</a> that in Q1 2021 it was Southeast Asia&#39;s most downloaded app, with its mobility and delivery services drawing the highest share of average monthly active smartphone users in the region across iOS and Android combined.</p>

        


        

<p>Not only are more people downloading the app in Southeast Asia, they are spending more. According to Grab, its spend per user increased by 31 per cent year-on-year.</p>

</ul>
<p>The multinational company also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/investors/#lightbox-o6r87">said</a> in 2020 it was overall responsible for 50 per cent of Southeast Asia&#39;s online food delivery, 72 per cent of the region&#39;s ride-hailing services and 23 per cent of its e-wallet market. The online food delivery segment seems to be the one to watch, as it experienced 96 per cent year-on-year growth from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021.</p>
<p>In an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/investors/#lightbox-o6r87">investor&#39;s call</a>, Grab president Ming Maa said: &#34;In Q1 2021, in spite of [COVID] re-emergence in various countries at different times, the diversification of our platform from both a geographic and segment perspective resulted in fairly stable GMV performance over the quarter.</p>
<p>&#34;Now we did witness weaker mobility volumes in Q1, but this was offset by a strong uptick in deliveries with Grabmart proving to be one of the bright spots in the delivery segment.&#34;</p>

        

<p>Maa attributed the shift from mobility to delivery to lockdown measures across Southeast Asia. As for the future, he predicted:</p>

<p>Another expectation for Grab in the second half of 2021 is its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/14/grab_goes_public_through_spac/">plans</a> to go public in the United States through a US$40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).</p>

      <title>Google hits undo on Chrome browser alert change that broke websites, web apps</title>
      <link>https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/05/google_chrome_iframe/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_theregister_com_2021_08_05_google_chrome_iframe_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Google has temporarily reversed Chrome&#39;s removal of browser alert windows and other prompts created via cross-origin iframes after a rocky rollout over the past two weeks broke web apps and alarmed developers.</p>
<p>An iframe, or Inline Frame, is a portion of a web page embedded in another web page. When it includes resources from a different origin or domain, it&#39;s a cross-origin iframe.</p>
<p>Since March, 2020, the team behind Chromium, the open-source engine of Chrome, has been planning to limit the capabilities of cross-origin iframes because they&#39;re a security liability. Specifically, they allow an embedded resource like an ad to present a prompt as if it were the host domain.</p>

    

<p>&#34;The current user experience is confusing, and has previously led to spoofs where sites pretend the message comes from Chrome or a different website,&#34; a Google engineer explained in the company&#39;s initial <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/hTOXiBj3D6A/m/PVc8zwKTAwAJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Intent to Remove notice</a> last year.</p>

        


        

<p>&#34;Removing support for cross origin iframes’ ability to trigger the UI will not only prevent this kind of spoofing, but will also unblock further efforts to make the dialog more recognizable as part of the website rather than the browser.&#34;</p>
<p>Google&#39;s answer to spoofing has been to prevent JavaScript code in cross-origin iframes from calling the alert, prompt, and confirm methods on the browser&#39;s window object – which web developers use to show dialog boxes for user notifications and interaction.</p>

        

<p>By doing so, Google has broken more than a few web apps. And eventually, Google <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6897#issuecomment-885773622" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plans</a> to remove these prompt mechanisms completely (from same-origin contexts as well as cross-origin ones), again to prevent potential abuse.</p>
<p>The deprecation of <code>window.alert</code>, <code>window.prompt</code>, and <code>window.confirm</code> from cross-origin iframes took effect with the release of Chrome 92.0.4515.107 on July 20. Since then, applications like social dev environment <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/3827" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Codepen</a> and Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/southpolesteve/status/1422973696621350913?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azure Cosmos DB</a> have encountered problems because they present users with alerts, notifications, and confirmation windows via cross-origin iframes.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1065085" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chromium issue</a> where the removal is being tracked, developers have been chiming in to express their dismay at the way this change has been forced upon the web community.</p>
<p>&#34;This change has created quite a difficulty for us because we use a paid third party service embedded via iframe in our web app and I pass a small amount of limited custom JavaScript to that third party app when I instantiate their tool (to trigger some actions and customize part of the tool to the user),&#34; <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1065085#c24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> one developer last week.&#34; ...With this change I am scrambling to implement an ugly <code>window.parent.postMessage</code> workaround because chunks of our web app are now broken for our tens of thousands of users.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I&#39;m an engineer for a large ERP company and work on a product where hundreds of large customers (hundreds of thousands of users) are no longer able to use the product due to the removal of cross origin dialogs,&#34; <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1065085#c37" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> another developer.</p>

        

<p>&#34;These customers generally choose to host the product themselves, which means signing up for the origin would fall on each of them individually. That isn&#39;t feasible for us or their IT departments. We internally are not even able to get it to work. We are also getting pushback on asking them to push out registry settings.&#34;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>My team is working around the clock and weekends trying to rewrite our product around this change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;My team is working around the clock and weekends trying to rewrite our product around this change and simply need more time. This type of change should have been documented and warned about ahead of time in my opinion.&#34;</p>
<p>The outcry has proven voluble enough that Microsoft Edge last week <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1065085#c40" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reverted the changes</a> in its upstream Chromium code to restore dialogs in cross-origin iframes. Shortly thereafter, a Google engineer said Chrome has <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1065085#c41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">disabled its deprecation until August 15</a> to provide developers with more time to rewrite their apps.</p>
<p>Google has even implemented a four-month opt-in &#34;<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/register_trial/2541156089743802369" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reverse origin trial</a>&#34; that temporarily revives cross-origin prompts for Chrome users and gives developers retrofitting large web apps more time to find replacements for the exiled API methods.</p>
<p>&#34;This is peak Chrome; what seems to be a reasonably good idea that&#39;s hampered because it was pushed out thoughtlessly without putting any serious effort into notifying the people affected or making sure that nothing else breaks, or making sure that it thoroughly solves the problem,&#34; wrote developer Daniel Shumway in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28055802" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> to Hacker News.</p>
<p>&#34;The product owners at Chrome are smart, but they&#39;re careless and constantly break the web because they don&#39;t seem to have enough of a sense of gravitas or caution about what they&#39;re doing.&#34; ®</p>

<h4><a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/archive">July 29, 2021</a>
    <span><a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/book">book</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/design">design</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/language">language</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/personal">personal</a></span>

<p>My book <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a> on programming languages is done. OK, OK.
I know <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/">I said it was done like fifteen months ago</a>. But now it’s <em>really</em>
done. And by that I mean, the print, ebook and PDF versions are done. <strong>You can
<a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/">buy it</a>.</strong> You can hold it in your hands. And I do mean “hands” plural.
Because this little “handbook” turned out way larger than I anticipated:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/"></a>
  <figcaption>This is a proof copy, so it looks a little different than the final design.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Look at that thing. 640 pages, eight inches wide, ten inches tall. If you get
tired of reading it, it can serve as a doorstop or protect you from small-arms
fire.</p>

<p>Remember back on Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood when he would take you to a factory
and show you how pencils or umbrellas are made? I love that stuff, so I thought
maybe you might like to see what I spent the past year on. You can read this as
a peek behind the curtain, or maybe a long apology for why it took so long.</p>

<h2>Where I left off</h2>

<p>What I said in my last post was that <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> was <em>finished</em>, and
by that I meant that I’d written all the code, dotted the last sentence, and
scanned the last illustration. The <em>content</em> of the book was complete. But it
wasn’t a book yet. Just a pile of Markdown and PNG files that my embarrassingly
bad Python code would begrudgingly turn into a website.</p>

<p>My original goal was always to make a real book, with pages and everything.
Completing the content was just one (granted, the most important) step in that
journey. Once I finished the last chapter and put it online, I took about a
month-long break. I had been writing <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/note/log.txt">every single day for almost four
years</a> and I was <em>fried</em>. Also, in case you don’t remember, early 2020 was
not exactly a Totally Fine Time in World History.</p>

<h2>A new build system</h2>

<p>After a few weeks, my desire to have this project completely done returned and I
eased my way back into working on it. I fixed a whole pile of typos and other
mistakes that readers <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/issues">filed bugs for</a> (thanks!).</p>

<p>Then, for no real good reason at all, I decided to rewrite the whole build
system for the book in Dart. The build script I wrote for <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">my first book</a>
was dead simple. <a href="https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/blob/master/script/format.py">Literally a single Python script</a> that took a Markdown
file for each book chapter and rendered it to HTML while weaving in the code
snippets. The world’s dumbest static site generator.</p>

<p>I started with that for <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> but then it grew and grew. My
second book includes every single line of code for two complete interpreters,
which it builds up incrementally across thirty chapters. I needed to not just
build the HTML for the book’s website, but also make sure the code really did
work. I gave the build system the ability to not only generate the site for the
book, but also to slice and dice the code. Given a chapter, or even a single
point within a chapter, it can output a program containing all of the code for
the interpreters up to that point. Then I can take that code, compile it, and
run it through my automated test suite to make sure the code I’m showing you
does what it’s supposed to.</p>

<p>Useful, but really straining the limits of how much code I want to maintain in a
dynamically typed language like Python, at least, with my (low) level of Python
expertise. Also, it was, frankly, really slow. So over a period of a couple of
weeks, I rewrote the whole thing in Dart.</p>

<p>I work at Google on the <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart language</a> team as my day job, so picking
Dart was not an unbiased choice. But it’s my build system for my book, and I
know Dart and many of its core libraries and packages like the back of my hand.
Hell, I personally wrote the initial version of the canonical <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/markdown">markdown
package</a>.</p>

<p>I found a pretty nice <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/mustache_template">package for mustache templates</a>, so I converted
the book’s old Liquid templates to that. I didn’t find a good syntax
highlighter. But it’s not like I looked very hard either. It seemed like just
the kind of fun thing to implement from scratch, so I whipped one up loosely
based on Pygments.</p>

<p>The end result is a new build system that generates <em>exactly</em> the HTML and
syntax-highlighted code that I want. Also, it is literally ten <em>times</em> faster
than the old Python one. As you’ll see, it turned out to be handy that I had
better control over the Markdown processing, but at the time I was basically
just doing this for fun and to procrastinate the real work.</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>I planned to implement some clever incremental rebuild logic in
  the dev server, but it builds so fast that I just rebuild everything on every
  refresh.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once I had the new build system outputting nice clean HTML and I’d deleted the
old Python stuff, it was time to get started.</p>

<h2>Designing the book</h2>

<p>Doing a large graphic design project like a book works a lot like web dev or
game programming where it sort of has two levels. First you set up your
“framework” or “engine”. On the web, this is your web framework and all of your
CSS and HTML templates. In games, it’s your game engine. Then you pour content
into that structure. With the right framework, adding content is easy.</p>

<p>For graphic design using a program like Adobe InDesign, the way it works is you
set up styles and masters. A master defines the margins and grid lines for a
page. It’s the fences that corral all the text to keep those feral letters from
running around eating all the whitespace. Styles are like CSS: they let you take
a semantic kind of text or object and associate specific fonts, styles and
colors for it.</p>

<p>In theory, you get the masters and styles right and then typesetting is pretty
easy and mechanical. Now, I did <em>not</em> make my life easy when it comes to book
design. Book design is literally a two-dimensional spatial exercise and I made
my job harder both horizontally and vertically. If you’ve read any of it on the
web, you know my book has:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prose, of course. So many words.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of asides that need to be right next to certain pieces of text, code
or illustrations that they refer to. Some of these can get pretty long.</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty of code. Also, each code snippet has a little location blurb next to
it telling you where the code goes in the resulting program.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How wide?</h2>

<p>Horizontally, the main text column needs to be wide enough to fit the longest
line of code. I can use shorter lines and wrap the snippets more, but that makes
them harder to read. It also makes them vertically taller, which causes its own
problem.</p>

<p>Then I need room next to that for the asides, since they often remark directly
on specific sentences. I can make <em>those</em> narrower too, of course. But then they
wrap and get taller. Some asides are fairly long and if they get too tall, they
start colliding with each other or overlapping location snippets.</p>

<p>Oh, and since I ended up writing a 200k+ word book, it’s going to have a high
page count. That means a thick book. Thick books need wider inner margins so the
text doesn’t disappear into the spine.</p>

<p>All of this points towards a pretty wide page. Most CS textbooks—at least
the ones on my bookshelf—are 7.5 inches wide. I tried hard to come up with
a design that fit the code, asides, and healthy margins in that width while
still giving a text size that didn’t require a magnifying glass. Eventually, I
conceded defeat.</p>

<p>Once I tried designing a set of metrics for an 8 inch wide page, everything fell
into place. I could have enough breathing room around the text to make it
enjoyable to read, a decent length for the code snippets, and plenty of room for
the asides. (Using a narrower font for the asides helped too).</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>Here are the final horizontal metrics.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>How tall?</h2>

<p>That left the other dimension. If I were going with a real publisher doing a
full offset print run, I could pick whatever page size I wanted. But since I’m
self publishing, that would mean paying up front for thousands of copies to be
printed and, I don’t know, storing all the boxes in my garage or something.</p>

<p>Print on demand worked great for my last book, and I planned to do the same
thing for this one. That meant sticking to the limited set of page sizes that
KDP and IngramSpark support. The only reasonable one that is 8 inches wide is
8&#34;×10&#34;, so that’s what I picked. The end result is a book that feels big, but
hopefully not awkwardly huge. I’m sorry. I promise to write a smaller book if I
ever write another.</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>The metrics for a complete chapter spread. Vertically, text is
  aligned to a classic 12pt baseline grid.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The whole time I was picking these margins and metrics, I was also selecting
fonts and building styles. You can’t do graphic design in a vacuum, so I picked
a test chapter and just typeset it and tweaked the fonts over and over again.
Eventually I got a set of fonts and styles I liked, some masters that seemed
workable, and I was ready to go. The framework was done and now it was time to
open the content hose.</p>

<h2>XML, like its 1999</h2>

<p>Of course, problem #1 is that there <em>is</em> no content hose. I have to build one.
InDesign doesn’t know what the hell Markdown or my weird ass build system is.
I sure as hell didn’t want to, like, copy every chapter from my browser, paste
it into InDesign and then manually apply all the styles. I have a high pain
tolerance, but I’m not a masochist.</p>

<p>What InDesign <em>can</em> do is import XML. Even better, you can set it up to
automatically apply certain paragraph or character styles to certain tag names.
InDesign’s XML support, alas, has not matured much since the time I described it
as <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/11/03/bringing-my-web-book-to-print-and-ebook/">being implemented by a narcoleptic intern</a>. For example, in HTML
you can italicize a word in a header by taking an italics tag and nesting it
inside a header tag. InDesign cannot comprehend such advanced data modeling. It
needs a flat series of unnested tags and if you need italics in your header, you
damn well better have a unique <code>&lt;italics-header&gt;</code> tag for it.</p>

<p>But now I had an ace up my sleeve. Since I had microscopic control over my build
system and its Markdown processing, I could write my own <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/tool/bin/build_xml.dart">custom XML exporter</a>
that generated <em>exactly</em> the tags that would make InDesign not cry and avoid as
many InDesign XML import bugs as possible.</p>

<h2>JavaScript, in <em>my</em> InDesign?</h2>

<p>Even so, XML import only gets you so far. Specifically, it gets you a “story” in
InDesign terms: a single continuous narrative of text that fills the main text
box and spans multiple pages:</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>What the initial XML import looks like. The pink text is where
  an illustration goes and the “@” tells me where to anchor the aside.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The main story is where the prose and code snippets go, but the asides and the
location markers need to be pulled out float off to the side. With my last book,
I yanked those out manually. I literally cut each aside from the main text
column and pasted it into a new text box. It took forever, and that book was
less than half as long as this one with <em>way</em> fewer code snippets.</p>

<p>There are <em>1,133</em> code snippets in <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>. If I had to manually
cut and paste the location markers for each of those, I would lose my mind.
Worse, I would make a lot of mistakes, which would just create more work for
myself.</p>

<p>I’m an engineer so I am morally opposed to error-prone manual effort that can be
automated. Did you know that InDesign can be scripted using JavaScript? Well,
you do now, which apparently places you in a tiny minority because there are,
like, <em>no</em> docs for it out there. You can find a couple of auto-generated
references, a few sad cries for help from graphic designers clearly out of
their element with no responses, and that’s it.</p>

<p>JavaScripting InDesign is a special kind of pain. There is no debugger. There
are no stack traces. There aren’t even <em>debug prints</em>. There is literally just
<code>alert()</code>, and you can only call it <em>once</em>. And it halts your script.
Fortunately, I actually learned JavaScript back when that’s all <em>browsers</em> gave
you, so I can hack it.</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>Just like developing for IE6.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I managed to cobble together a horrific script that would find all of the asides
and location markers, pull them out of the main text flow, and leave them off to
the side:</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>Asides and location markers are pulled out of the main flow and
  into their own text boxes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I wasn’t able to get the script to do was <em>position</em> the boxes correctly.
But InDesign has a thing called “anchors” where you can lock the position of an
element relative to another. A couple of carefully crafted Object Styles would
even set the horizontal metrics correctly and align the text to the right
baseline. All I had to do was anchor each text box and it worked perfectly!</p>

<p>Wait, did I say “perfectly”? I meant  it worked right about half the time and
the other half the time InDesign would inexplicably <em>turn off the fucking
borders of nearby code snippets</em>.</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>What it looks like when InDesign hates you.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I lost hours of my life to this stupid bug. Eventually, I realized that some
completely random subset of location tags would have to be manually positioned
because anchoring invariably broke some borders.</p>

<h2>Editing, again</h2>

<p>All of the above took me a good month or so and then it was time to stop
fiddling around and get to work on the actual content. The first thing I did was
another editing pass of the entire book, front to back. I had already done three
drafts of each chapter as I was writing them, but I wanted to do one more now
that it was done so that I could get a better feel for continuity. It turns out
I repeated the same dumb jokes a lot. I fixed (most of) those.</p>

<p>This took five months. There’s nothing fun to say about this, it was just a
chore.</p>

<h2>Copy editing</h2>

<p>Next I hired an actual professional copy editor, <a href="https://karisomerton.com/">Kari Somerton</a>, to go
through and do the same thing. She was great. Most of the editing world uses
Microsoft Word and “Track Changes” to handle the editing process. Like most
software engineers, I live and breathe plaintext and Git. That way I can see
diffs of the changes, and go back through history.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to abandon my workflow so I asked Kari to ramp up on Git and my
weird completely bespoke build system. She handled it with aplomb and churned
through the book in no time. She found hundreds and hundreds of mistakes. This
despite me doing four drafts and readers filing hundreds of issues already.
Professional copy editors are worth every penny.</p>

<h2>Typesetting the whole thing</h2>

<p>Once the words were as good as they were gonna get, it was time to get them onto
pages. The process went like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new InDesign file for the next chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Export it to XML.</p></li>
<li><p>Import the XML into InDesign.</p></li>
<li><p>Run my little JavaScript script to pull out the asides and location markers.</p></li>
<li><p>Go through and anchor the side bar stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix up whitespace at the end of pages.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first five steps are a piece of cake. I’d wake up in the morning, brew a cup
of coffee, shamble upstairs to the iMac, and get started. I could grind through
those steps while half awake and get a chapter done in half an hour or so. It
was peaceful. Almost meditative.</p>

<p>And then step six. You see, that right there is the hard thing about typesetting
a book. And it’s the really hard thing about typesetting <em>this</em> book. Because it
turns out there are a bunch of constraints on how content can be fit vertically
in a page. Obviously, we can’t slice an illustration in half and put the top
half on one page and the bottom half on the next. The asides also really need to
fit on one page too, or it gets confusing to keep track of what they refer to.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, it’s nice for the code snippets to not get split across pages
too. Some of those can be over a dozen lines long. (This is another reason why
wider horizontal metrics helped. Because if I had made the code snippets
narrower, they would end up taller, which would make them harder to fit on the
page.) And you don’t want a header alone at the end of a page with no content
after it. And it’s good to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows and orphans</a>…</p>

<p>Take all of those rules and restrictions, and mix in the completely fixed height
of a page and you got yourself a real constraint solving problem. Or, in my
case, 640 of them, all interwoven with each other. Because, you see, InDesign is
happy to solve all of this for you by just pushing content to later pages. Code
snippet too long? Move it to the next page. No room for prose under the header?
Move it all to the next page. What that gives you is a ton of dead white space
at the bottom of pages. It looks terrible and wastes space, like this:</p>

  <figcaption>I thoughtfully left room on the page for your own doodles.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Speaking of illustrations…</h2>

<p>At one level, the illustrations were easy. I specifically chose black and white
pen and ink because it’s print friendly. When I first scanned the images as I
wrote each chapter, I brought them in at glorious 1200 DPI. Here’s a crop:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>A little level adjustment in Photoshop produces:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>So detailed! Exporting these to high resolution bitmaps that print well was a
snap, and they look great. (Well, as great as my handwriting looks, I guess.)</p>

<p>Incorporating the illustrations into the page layout was another story. Halfway
through typesetting, a lightbulb went off and I finally realized why most books
say, “Refer to Figure 123 to see blah blah blah…” That gives the typesetter
freedom to put Figure 123 wherever the hell it fits on any nearby page.</p>

<p>In my dumb book, because I am an idiot, the prose just refers directly to the
illustration. The illustration needs to be <em>right there</em> or the text doesn’t
make sense. I didn’t think about that when each chapter was an infinitely
scrolling web page, and by the time I realized, it was too late.</p>

<p>With the hundreds of illustrations and thousand-plus code snippets, I had given
myself thirty giant interrelated bin-packing exercises. The hard part of
typesetting was figuring out how to adjust things to minimize that dead space.
Sometimes I’d split a code snippet in two. Maybe add a little extra padding
around one image to spread stuff across the page a little. Or crowd another one
so that it <em>just</em> fits on the page. Sometimes I’d tweak an illustration to make
it shorter to fit on a page or taller to eat up some whitespace.</p>

<p>This was the real challenge of typesetting the book and why it took me two
months to get through all the chapters.</p>

<h2>Frontmatter and backmatter</h2>

<p>Did you know that there are professional indexers? People whose job it is to
write indexes for books? They even <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3625262.html">write books</a> about how to write
indexes. (One would presume that these books have truly superb indexes.)</p>

<p>I did not hire one of those eminently skilled professionals. Instead, I spent
two weeks going through every damn chapter <em>again</em> doing my best to pretend that
I know what I’m doing. InDesign’s support for indexes is actually pretty nice.
You can basically just select some text and say, “Make an index entry for this.”
Then it collects all of those and generates an index for the whole book. But
actually <em>adding</em> all of those entries is a mind-numbing chore.</p>

<p>The index is the main piece of “backmatter”—the stuff at the end of a book
after its main content. There is also “frontmatter”. You’ll never guess where
that goes. I put together a title page, copyright page, dedication, and
acknowledgements. Then I let InDesign generate a table of contents for me.</p>

<p>This was a magical moment. At this point, I had a complete book:</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>Here’s what the inside looks like.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Or, at least, I had the <em>inside</em> of one.</p>

<h2>Cover design</h2>

<p>A lot of authors obsess over their cover and envision it the whole time they are
writing. Despite what the aphorism says, people <em>do</em> judge books by their cover
and a good one makes a big difference. At least, that’s the case over in fiction
land. In computer science, judging by the other books I have laying around, the
artistic merit of the cover appears to be somewhat less critical. I guess when
the prof says you have to buy the book to pass the class, a clip art cover is
sufficiently compelling.</p>

<p>Since I am <em>not</em> a professor who can garner sales by fiat, I spent a lot of time
on the cover design. I take photos, so I thought it could look nice to put
something detailed on the cover to liven it up. I went through my thousands of
photos trying to find something that fit. And, while I have some pretty
pictures, none of them felt like they worked as covers. They felt arbitrary.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that the visual language of the book is those pen and ink
illustrations. So I drew a bigger more detailed version of <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html#the-parts-of-a-language">the mountain
illustration I use as a metaphor for the compilation process</a>. I also
hand-lettered a new title:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>It’s a real typeface (Acumin Pro Extra Condensed) but I hand-traced a printout
to give it some imperfect charm. I picked a color palette to try to give it a
sort of a mimeographed 1950s scouting manual vibe.</p>

<h2>Proofreading the proof</h2>

<p>Now I really had a book. I uploaded the PDF exports to KDP and ordered a proof
copy. A week later, a surprisingly heavy box arrived. This was the first moment
I really understood just how <em>big</em> this book I wrote is. Up until this point, it
was just data files. But seeing it fill up an Amazon box clarified the scale of
the project in a way that the time I spent never quite did.</p>

<p>So I had a book, but it <em>still</em> wasn’t done. Because the typesetting process
involved a lot of manual labor. To err is human, so now I had to
<em>proofread</em>—to literally go through the proof and read it looking for
mistakes. I marked them all with sticky notes:</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>I put an “x” on each sticky note to mark when I had applied the
  fix to the InDesign files.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here’s where it got stressful. If you’re a programmer, then source control and
diff is deeply ingrained in your workflow. Whenever I make a change, I take for
granted that I can then see a diff in the commit to verify that I changed only
what I intended and nothing else.</p>

<p>I did put the InDesign files in a Git repo, but they are giant opaque binary
files. Also, InDesign has a habit of changing them even when it doesn’t seem
like I’ve actually made any real changes. There’s nothing quite like syncing all
the styles across the chapters, seeing every single file marked changed and
wondering, “Did I just accidentally move every bullet list item 3 points to the
left?” It felt like flying blind at exactly the stage in the process where I
really wanted to see <em>exactly</em> what was happening.</p>

<p>Did I engineer my way out of this problem? You’re <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/tool/bin/tile_pages.dart">damn right I did</a>. I
wrote a Dart script that would take a PDF of the book, extract every page, and
then generate a single huge PNG file with every page tiled across it. It looks
like this:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>If you zoom in, each page is about this big:</p>

<figure>
  
  <figcaption>If you’re on a retina display, this is a 100% zoom.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Every time I changed the InDesign files and committed them, I exported a PDF
for that commit and generated a tile image. Then I wrote a little Photoshop
action that would take two of those and draw a big red border around any pixels
that differed. Here is what all of the proofreading changes look like:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>And zoomed in:</p>

<figure>
  
</figure>

<p>There isn’t enough detail in the tile image to tell exactly what changed, but
the red tells me which pages need a visual inspection. I know I should be proud
of, like, writing an entire textbook on programming languages. But, honestly, I
think I’m most proud of this dumb little script. It was <em>such</em> a relief to be
able to programmatically verify that, yes, this PDF looks exactly like the last
one except for the one expected change.</p>

<h2>Ebooks are also books</h2>

<p>Once I incorporated all the proofreading fixes, the print edition was really
for real totally done. But people also like reading ebooks and Kindle, so I
needed to make those too.</p>

<p>Again, writing my own build system helped. I tweaked it to be able to export the
antiquated XHTML that EPUB requires as well as all the weird metadata and
manifest stuff that goes into one. A few command-line invocations later and I
had Kindle and EPUB ebooks. I tested in a bunch of readers and tweaked the CCS
to try to find a compromise between all of their renderers.</p>

<h2>Updating the site and launching</h2>

<p>At this point—and now we’re talking this past weekend as I write this
sentence—I had a folder with all of the final files for every edition of
the book. All that remained was to update the front page of the book’s website
to point to where people can get them. I took some photos and put on my web
designer hat for a while. I tried to make it tolerably responsive.</p>

<p>Then I wrote this blog post. It’s weird to put that in the past tense since I
just wrote it. But I guess it’s in the past now.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I’m going to upload the files to the various sites and stores. I’ll
update the site to have links to all of those as they go live. Once the stores
have processed the uploads and everything is available, I’ll publish this post
and update the site. I’ll write a note for the mailing list and feel nervous
emailing that many people. If you’re reading this, I already did all that and
the book is really, really done.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Ever since I finished the last chapter, people have been asking me what I’m
going to do next. I have people I consider close friends now who have never
known me when I <em>wasn’t</em> writing this book.</p>

<p>Many ask what I’m going to write next, or suggest a topic. I interpret this as a
compliment: They like my writing and want more. But it also feels like asking a
mom in labor whether she plans to have more kids. I’ve had my legs in the
stirrups for six years, so I’m gonna just relax a bit after all the pushing is
over before I even <em>think</em> about another book baby.</p>

<p>What I really plan to do is… not <em>plan</em> to do anything. This writing project
has been an enormous exercise in self-applied delayed gratification. On top of
that, the pandemic brought its own basket of deferred dreams. I’ve gotten so
skilled at denying myself and postponing, so good at tuning out what I <em>feel</em>
like doing, that it’s hard to even hear it any more. I don’t remember what my
own joy sounds like.</p>

<p>So I’m gonna check out for a while and go hunting for my pleasure centers. Maybe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMJ0iRwAhIFYSpntOEtn2g">make some more music</a>. Maybe go fishing. Probably spend more time with
friends and family (safely). I might get back to working on <a href="https://github.com/munificent/hauberk">my
roguelike</a>. Or maybe I won’t do any of those. Maybe I’ll just go out in
the backyard and bask mindlessly in the sun like a lizard. The important part is
I won’t decide until I feel like it.</p>

<p>I’m sure eventually I’ll get the itch to work on something more sizeable again.
(But, God-willing, I will never spend six years on a single project again in my
life.) Until then, I hope you enjoy the book. Despite all the work, I had a lot
of fun making it, and it was <em>always</em> a joy to hear from readers who liked it.
It’s the only thing that kept me going this long and enabled me to get it done.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><a href="https://matthewdgreen.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/383ba-kryptos.jpg"></a>If you’re looking for a nice dose of crypto conspiracy theorizing <i>and </i>want to read a paper by some very knowledgeable cryptographers, I have just the paper for you. Titled “<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">A Riddle Wrapped in an Enigma</a>” by Neal Koblitz and Alfred J. Menezes, it tackles one of the great mysteries of the year 2015. Namely: <i>why did the NSA just freak out and </i><a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/nsa-preps-quantum-resistant-algorithms-to-head-off-crypto-apocolypse/"><i>throw its Suite B program down the toilet</i></a><i>?</i></p>
<p>Koblitz and Menezes are noted cryptographers and mathematicians, together responsible for scores of papers, including a recent series of position papers such as “<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/152">Another Look at Provable Security</a>” (mentioned previously on this blog) and “<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201003/rtx100300357p.pdf">The Brave New World of Bodacious Assumptions in Cryptography</a>”. (Yes, that is a real paper title.)</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">latest paper</a> is highly accessible and contains almost no mathematics, so it’s worth your time to go read it now. If you don’t, or can’t handle reading things typeset in LaTeX, I’m going to sum up the gist of their arguments as best I can, then talk about why this all matters.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some background.</p>
<h3><b>What is Suite B, and what do you mean by NSA ‘freaking out’?</b></h3>
<p>For most of the past century, the NSA (and its predecessors) have jealously guarded a monopoly on advanced cryptography. This approach worked reasonably well through the 1980s, then rapidly became unsustainable. There were a couple of reasons for this. First, the PC revolution made it impossible for the NSA to keep encryption out of the hands of ordinary users and industry — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States">as much as the NSA tried to make this so</a>. Second, Congress got fed up with paying for expensive bespoke computer systems, and decided the DoD should buy its computing equipment off the shelf like everyone else.</p>
<p>The result was the Cryptographic Modernization Program, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography">Suite B</a> — the first public cryptography standard to include <i>non-classified</i> algorithms certified for encrypting Secret and Top Secret data. Suite B was standardized for industry in the mid/late 1990s, and was notable for its exclusive reliance on (then new) field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> (ECC) for public key encryption and key agreement.</p>
<p>At the time of Suite B’s adoption, ECC was relatively new to the non-classified world. Many industry and academic cryptographers didn’t feel it had been reasonably studied (Koblitz and Menezes’ anecdotes on this are priceless). ECC was noteworthy for using dramatically shorter keys than alternative public-key algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> and “classical” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman</a>, largely because new sub-exponential attacks that worked in those settings did not seem to have any analogue in the ECC world.</p>
<p>The NSA pushed hard for adoption. Since they had the best mathematicians, and moreover, clearly had the most to lose if things went south, the standards bodies were persuaded to go along. The algorithms of Suite B were standardized and — aside from a few intellectual property concerns — have been gradually adopted even by the non-classified community.</p>
<p>Then, in August of this year, NSA <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/">freaked out</a>.</p>
<p>It was a quiet freakout, as you would expect from the world’s largest spy agency. But it made big waves with cryptographers. Citing concerns about future developments in quantum computing, the Agency updated the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/">Suite B website to announce a rapid transition <i>away</i> from Suite B</a>, and to a new set of quantum-resistant algorithms in the coming years.</p>
<p>Why all the sudden and <i>immediate</i> concern about quantum computers? Well, the NSA obviously isn’t willing to talk about that. But as of 2013, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">leaked slides from the Snowden cache</a> show <i>no real evidence</i> of any massive quantum breakthroughs on the horizon that would necessitate a rapid transition from ECC.</p>
<p>Which quantum-resistant algorithms are we supposed to move to? Good question. Cryptographers haven’t agreed on any yet. Which makes the timing of this announcement so <i>particularly</i> mysterious.</p>
<p>So let me spell this out: despite the fact that quantum computers seem to be a long ways off <i>and </i>reasonable quantum-resistant replacement algorithms are nowhere to be seen, NSA decided to make this announcement <i>publicly</i> and not quietly behind the scenes. Weirder still, if you haven’t yet upgraded to Suite B, you are now being urged <i>not to</i>. In practice, that means some firms will stay with algorithms like RSA rather than transitioning to ECC at all. And RSA is <i>also</i> vulnerable to quantum attacks.</p>
<p>When reporters finally reached the NSA for comment, the only sound on the line was breaking glass and the sound of digging. (No, I’m kidding about that — but NSA did update their site <i>again</i> just to make it clear they weren’t playing some kind of deeply misguided April Fool’s prank.)</p>
<p>So that’s the background of the Koblitz/Menezes paper. The riddle is: what does the NSA know that we don’t?</p>
<h3><b>No quantum advance?</b></h3>
<p>Koblitz and Menezes exhaustively detail the possible reasons for the NSA’s announcement, ranging from the straightforward — that NSA actually <i>has</i> made a huge advance in developing quantum computers — to the downright bizarre. They even moot the possibility that the NSA is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=matthew+green+on+the+nsa&amp;oq=matthew+green+on+the+nsa&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i59j69i61j69i60.2961j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">so embarrassed about getting caught tampering with national standards</a> that they’ve just decided to flip the table and act like crazy people.</p>
<p>I’m going to skip most of the details, not because it isn’t interesting, but rather because I’d like to focus on what <i>I </i>think is the most intriguing hypotheses in the paper. Namely, that the NSA isn’t worried about quantum computers at all, but rather, that they’ve made a major advance in <i>classical </i>cryptanalysis of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem — and panic is the result.</p>
<p>Let me lay the groundwork. The security of most EC cryptosystems rests on the presumed intractability of a few basic mathematical problems. The most important of these is called the <a href="https://www.certicom.com/index.php/52-the-elliptic-curve-discrete-logarithm-problem">Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem</a> (ECDLP). This problem must be supremely hard to solve, or virtually every cryptosystem built on ECC unravels very quickly.</p>
<p>The definition of “hard” is important here. What we mean in the context of ECC is that the best known algorithm for solving the ECDLP requires a number of operations that is fully exponential in the security parameter. In practice, this means we can achieve 128-bit equivalent security using an elliptic curve set in a 256 bit field — which implies similarly-small keys and ciphertexts. To achieve equivalent security with RSA, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization#Factoring_algorithms">sub-exponential algorithms</a> apply, your keys need to be at least 3072 bits (!) long.</p>
<p>But while the ability to use (relatively) tiny elliptic curve points is wonderful for implementers, it leaves no room for error. If NSA’s mathematicians began to make even modest, but <i>sustained</i> advances in the state of the art for solving the ECDLP, it would put the entire field at risk. Beginning with the smallest of the standard curves, P-256, which would now provide less than the required 128-bit security.</p>
<p>Did I mention that as part of the recent announcement, NSA <i>also</i> <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/">deprecated P-256</a>?</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no reason to believe that classical cryptanalysis is at fault here. It’s possible that NSA really has reason to believe that quantum computing is moving faster than it was in 2013. It’s also possible that they’re just sloppy, and didn’t realize that <i>having a very public freakout about cryptography you just promoted for years</i> might not be such a good idea. But that seems doubtful.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">Koblitz and Menezes paper</a> for their take on all of the alternative hypotheses. I want to take a last few paragraphs to cover a slightly tangential issue, one that’s been the subject of a great deal of panic on the part of our community.</p>
<h3><b>Did the NSA really backdoor the NIST elliptic curves????1??1</b></h3>
<p>One of the nicer points of the Koblitz and Menezes paper is that it tackles the argument that the NSA deliberately backdoored the NIST elliptic curves.</p>
<p>This argument can be found in various places around the Internet. It originates with accomplished cryptographers who are quite rightly <a href="https://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/vortraege/20130531.pdf">applying skepticism</a> <a href="http://bada55.cr.yp.to/">to an oddball</a> and <i>ad hoc </i>process. It then heads off into <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/13/09/11/1224252/are-the-nist-standard-elliptic-curves-back-doored">crazytown</a>. Whether people admit it or not, this concern has been hugely influential in the recent adoption of non-NIST <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-curves-02">alternative curves</a> by the CFRG and IETF.</p>
<p>The accusation being leveled at NSA can be described simply. It’s known that the NIST pseudorandom curves were generated by the NSA hashing “seeds” through SHA1 to generate the curve parameters. This process was supposed to reassure the public, by eliminating the NSA’s ability to tamper with the parameters at will. However, nobody thought to restrict the NSA’s choice of input seeds — leading to a potential attack where they tried many different random seeds until they found a curve that contained a weakness the NSA could later exploit.</p>
<p>Koblitz and Menezes tackle this argument on grounds of basic common sense, history, and mathematics. The common sense argument, of course, is that <i>you don’t sh*t where you eat. </i>In other words, the NSA wouldn’t deliberately choose weak elliptic curves given that they planned to use them for encrypting Secret and Top Secret data for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>But common sense convinces nobody. The mathematical argument is a bit more subtle, and may work where self interest didn’t. Roughly speaking, Koblitz and Menezes point out that the NSA, despite their vast computing power, can’t try every possible seed. This is especially true given that they were generating these curves using 1990s equipment, and the process of evaluating (counting points on) an elliptic curve is computationally intensive. Thus, they assume that the NSA could try only test 2^{48} or so different curves for their hypothetical weakness.</p>
<p>By calculating the number of possible curve families, Koblitz and Menezes show that a vast proportion of curves (for P-256, around 2^{209} out of 2^{257}) would have to be weak in order for the NSA to succeed in this attack. The implications of such a large class of vulnerable curves is very bad for the field of ECC. It dwarfs <i>every previous known weak curve class </i>and would call into question the decision to use ECC <i>at all.</i></p>
<p>In other words, Koblitz and Menezes are saying that <i>if</i> you accept the weak curve hypothesis into your heart, the solution is not to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/cfrg/current/msg06426.html">replace the NIST elliptic curves</a> with anything at all, but rather, to leave the building as rapidly as possible and perhaps not shut the door on the way out. No joke.</p>
<p>On the gripping hand, this sounds very much like the plan NSA is currently implementing. Perhaps we <i>should</i> be worried.</p>

      <title>Contemporary COBOL: Developers&#39; Perspectives on Defects and Defect Location</title>

      <span>Abstract:</span>  Mainframe systems are facing a critical shortage of developer workforce as
the current generation of COBOL developers retires. Furthermore, due to the
limited availability of public COBOL resources, entry-level developers, who
assume the mantle of legacy COBOL systems maintainers, face significant
difficulties during routine maintenance tasks, such as code comprehension and
defect location. While we made substantial advances in the field of software
maintenance for modern programming languages yearly, mainframe maintenance has
received limited attention. With this study, we aim to direct the attention of
researchers and practitioners towards investigating and addressing challenges
associated with mainframe development. Specifically, we explore the scope of
defects affecting COBOL systems and defect location strategies commonly
followed by COBOL developers and compare them with the modern programming
language counterparts. To this end, we surveyed 30 COBOL and 74 modern
Programming Language (PL) developers to understand the differences in defects
and defect location strategies employed by the two groups. Our preliminary
results show that: (1) major defect categories affecting the COBOL ecosystem
are different than defects encountered in modern PL software projects; (2) the
most challenging defect types in COBOL are also the ones that occur most
frequently; and (3) COBOL and modern PL developers follow similar strategies to
locate defective code.

<p><time datetime="2021-07-27T08:12:01Z">Jul 27, 2021</time></p><p>What would you do of your $1+ million dollar sitting in your bank account or index funds in your dying bed?</p>
<p>There is something wrong with all those financial gurus out there. They only focus on accumulating wealth, instead of what truly matters: happiness. People drinking the kool-aids sometimes end up with situations so absurd, and start being so frugal they also forget in order to retire early. At the other end of the spectrum, we have some entrepreneurs or employees working 12+ hours/day simply for chasing the next million. And this at the sacrifice of simply <em><strong>living and enjoying life</strong></em>.</p>
<p>An average person has a lifespan of 72 years. It might sound quite long, but in practise, how much of the 72 years can we truly use? I’ll touch in this post about the 3 principles that, I believe, are keys to put into perspective to make the most of our life: <strong>Money</strong>, <strong>Free Time</strong> and <strong>Health</strong>. All 3 increase or decline the more we age. Most of us focus (too much / or only) on the <strong>money</strong> aspect. This is why we spend all our days working. <strong>Health</strong> and <strong>Free time</strong> are too often the forgotten ones. We assume money we accumulate during our young age will contribute to some sort of fulfillment when we will have plenty of free time when we will retire. Our society is actually designed around that timeline. But is it how we should live our life? What if once you retire, you don’t have the necessary health to travel? What if you have an incident tomorrow?</p>
<h2 id="time-your-scarcest-and-most-precious-resource">Time, your scarcest and most precious resource</h2>
<p>A typical timeline of someone’s life looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under 25, we’re getting into schools, have plenty of time playing around with friends. Our health is at its best. But we’re usually low on money and depends on our parent’s money</li>
<li>At 25, we get our first jobs, and start accumulating money. Now our time is usually stuck in our jobs. We’re still really healthy and try to balance activities and work</li>
<li>At 40, we might start having these lower back or knee issues. We continue accumulating money, and our job is still what take the most of our attention</li>
<li>At 50, we continue accumulating money, and start thinking about retirement. However, we definitely know that our body aren’t as great as in our 20s</li>
<li>At 65, we retired (ideally) with a lot of cash. We have plenty of time on our hands to do whatever we want. However, <em>our health has significantly declined</em> and we might not have as much motivation to do activities or see the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52950915-die-with-zero">“Die With Zero”</a>, the hours and energy we are “awake” to do things is referred to as <em><strong>“Life Energy”</strong></em>. There is just a limited amount of it. The main question is how do you spend that life energy? Is this life energy constant no matter our age?
<strong>From 18 to 40 is, in my humble opinion, the best years of our life.</strong>. Our health is at its peak. and we start making money, so can use it to do any kind of activities we wish. However with age, our health declines, and we start seeing its undesired effects starting in our 40s (some might argue 30s). We start saying no because of [ back - knees - bones - etc ] conditions. One diagram that stuck with me was the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">“Life in weeks” from “Wait But Why”</a>, where we can see weeks represented in squares. I’ve adapted it to illustrate my point:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This diagram summarizes how much Free Time, Money, Health we have depending of our age:
</p>
<p>The <em>“best years of our life”</em>, when our health is at its peak, and we can start to use our money, are from 18 to 40, so <strong>22 years</strong>. For someone with a 9-5 job (or study), this is how time is split during those 22 years:</p>
<p></p>
<p>62,000 hours (33%) of our time is spent in bed. 50,000 hours (27%) is spent working and commuting. That leaves us with <strong>57,000 hours when we could experience the world at our “maximum” potential</strong>.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Free Time is limited</strong>. Think twice before saying “no”, to delay an activity because of “saving” for the future when you probably can’t do it. Think even more when you work over-time. <strong>No-one ever said “I wish I worked more” in their death bed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="spending-money-as-soon-as-possible-in-the-right-things">Spending Money as soon as possible (in the right things)</h2>
<p>The (sad) truth in today’s society is that money is needed to contribute to your happinessess. Even though some might argue that money isn’t doesn’t make you happy, it definitely contributes to happinessess, to fund a <strong>pleasant</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong> and <strong>meaningful</strong> life:
</p>
<h3 id="whats-wrong-with-saving-too-much">What’s wrong with saving too much?</h3>
<p>Most people working think about making money to save for retirement. When time comes, that money will be used for enjoying life and they’ll have more free time. There also exists now many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">F.I.R.E</a> (early retirement) gurus that keeps talking about living frugally to a point where you sacrifice social life, family and friends. It is true that investing early will make a difference with the amount of money you’ll end up with in 30+ years, but who guarantees you that you’ll live until then? Even if you reach that stage, what will we do with this million dollars saved/invested when we will lay in our death bed? No one died saying “I wish I had more money”. Will your physical condition at 50+ years old allow you to do the same type of activities as your 30s?</p>
<p><strong>Money exists to be spent</strong>. You’ll never regret <strong>spending money into experiences or things that can create memories</strong> (either good or bad). They add a lot into fulfilling your life and shape the way we are:
</p>
<p>It is also true that we don’t necessarily need money to make memories. Under 25, we’re incredibly good at finding ways to get things for free. But the more we move in our age, the more we can unlock some of the experience that can be accessed with money. You’ll get the most benefit of it the earlier you spend it. One of the benefits of spending it early is those activities is they <strong>keep yielding dividends continuously and indefinitely</strong>. We keep thinking and talking about them:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As said earlier, we spend 1/3 of our “career stage” at work, and we do this mainly for money. The longer we work, the more skills we get, so the more money we make. However, our best years also happen during that career phase, and this is when we can get the most of the experiences that will inevitably compound in time. Do you want to spend all your career phase and miss out on all the experiences you can get when you’re young and healthy? There exist some solutions to allocate better our time during that phase, such as starting our own company, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp">early retirement</a>, getting better paychecks (or <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_1">more as a contractor</a>), or working for companies with <a href="https://4dayweek.io?ref=todaypurpose.com">4 days work week</a>.</p>
<h3 id="whats-wrong-with-saving-too-little">What’s wrong with saving too little?</h3>
<p><strong>You don’t want to end up old and poor</strong>. There is also a balance to find between spending money and saving money. There is a limit on where you should spend your money, and everyone has a different limit depending on our income. Generally speaking, spending your money every year on the latest Iphone, defaulting to 5 stars hotel, or business class tickets isn’t the best use of your money. Unless occasionally, they won’t bring you much value in our life (except for external validation). This is where I usually start saying no, and invest that extra money for my future self:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make that extra money <em>work for you</em>. Invest into diversified index funds so you can use the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp#growth-of-compound-interest">power of compound interest</a>, and use that “free money” in the later stage of your life. The <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/go-big-then-stop/?ref=todaypurpose.com">earlier you invest, the better it is</a>.</li>
<li>You will also want to have emergency funds (6 months of expenses in your bank account) that can be used as a buffer in case of losing a job, unexpected bills, injury, etc…</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Find your balance between investing your money for the future , and spending on what matters (memories) in the present.</em></p>
<h2 id="preserve-your-whealth">Preserve your <del>W</del>Health</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve got my $5 million, but I’d give it back if I could be 24 again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Health inevitably declines with age, and we can’t do anything about it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">yet</a>). Energy also decreases with our age. It doesn’t mean we should fatally see it decrease without doing anything. We can’t buy more time with money, but we can slow down our declining health. Would you prefer having health issues, being overweight with low energy in your 50-60? Or would you rather feel great, have enough energy to travel the world and still experience new things?</p>
<p>It is never too late to invest in your health. The time you’re spending (investing) into health will help your future self to get more of those delightful experiences that will make you more of those invaluable memories.</p>
<h3 id="eat-healthy">Eat healthy</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, you’ll be fine if you follow those rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid eating sugar and fruits. There is a misconception on fruit being healthy: They’re full of sugar and contribute heavily to diabetes. Our society <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-vegetables-before-domestication-photos-genetically-modified-food-natural">worked really hard to make us believe they’re healthy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/jhKZIq3SlYE?t=2939">Skip 1 meal a day</a> (also known as intermittent fasting).</li>
<li>If you are overweight, simply eat less, and workout more, there is no magic in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the rules I (try) to follow. Don’t get me wrong, I consider myself a foodie, and will usually say “Yes” for a great meal, or a Michelin restaurant. I consider eating as great “memories” I truly enjoy to remember.</p>
<h3 id="workout">Workout</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm">Heart attack is the #1 cause of death</a>. The indeniable truth is that <a href="https://youtu.be/jhKZIq3SlYE?t=3880">exercising makes you live longer</a>. It helps reduce heart attack risk, cancers, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Being weak isn’t fun either. Can’t follow for this hike? How about cycling this mountain?s</p>
<p>Find something you like to do <strong>regularly</strong> (at least 2 times a week). There are so many great sports you can do out there. You don’t have to stick to one, I personally like trying a sport every 3 years and it gives me new opportunities to experience new things in different places. Doing a sport regularly will also prepare you better for the future, you’ll likely follow in activities with friends or even your (grand) kids.</p>
<p>You’ll feel great most of your days.</p>
<h3 id="sleep-well">Sleep well</h3>
<p>We spend 1/3 of our life in bed. There is undeniable evidence that sleeping well is beneficial for all aspects of our life. We think more sharply, we feel better, we’re in a better mood, it also makes <a href="https://youtu.be/jhKZIq3SlYE?t=4202">you live longer</a>. Aren’t you feeling wonderful after a great night of sleep? Invest in a <del>good</del> great mattress.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-gift-to-your-kids">The best gift to your kids</h3>
<p>A not so common knowledge is that <strong>staying healthy is probably the best gift you can give to your (grand) kids</strong>, and believe it or not, even more than giving them an inheritance. We (usually) love our parents, and (hopefully) you also think about their well being. If they’re not in a healthy state, you’ll probably have to make sacrifices, changes your plans in order to help them. You don’t want to be that parent.</p>

  	<p>The last decade saw a proliferation of heart-warming stories where over-eager children bought expensive vehicles or toys using their parent&#39;s accounts on phones, tablets or using smart assistants like Alexa. Some of us have the opposite problem, dad-clicking our way into things we shouldn&#39;t. Dominic Preuss had this very issue recently, as his father-in-law charged over $14,000 to his credit card by accidentally purchasing the Full Self-Driving upgrade on his Tesla Model 3, <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2021/08/tesla-owner-charged-more-than-14000-after-someone-accidentally-clicked-and-bought-fsd-before-getting-a-refund/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reports <em>CarScoops.</em></a></p><p>The precise charges came out to $14,186.25, for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving plus tax. It&#39;s a hefty sum no matter how you cut it. Writing on Twitter, Preuss notes &#34;If you double click the shift panel twice and accidentally engage the auto-pilot in Model 3, Tesla will automatically charge you $14100 if you didn&#39;t previously purchase auto-pilot.&#34; </p>

The incident happened when Preuss&#39;s father in law was driving the car, and thus the charges were made without so much as a request for credit card info or any password authorization. The Tesla simply billed the credit card already on file. </p>







  <p>It suggests that anyone, even a child sitting in the car, could easily land a Tesla owner with a huge bill with just a few clicks. An email notification of the purchase alerted Preuss, who was able to cancel the charges. Heading into the &#34;Manage Upgrades&#34; settings let Preuss secure a refund to his credit card. </p>







  <div>
  	<p>The Tesla owner noted that the purchase may have been made through a different method than the one he quoted, but was made without any authorization regardless. Given that even most smartphones require a thumbprint or PIN entry to spend as little as 99 cents, it&#39;s a little horrifying that you can get billed fourteen big ones from a couple of mis-swipes by anyone who sits in the car. </p><p>We&#39;d expect Tesla to rectify the issue in a future update, though we can&#39;t verify this is on the cards as the company famously doesn&#39;t run a press department. In any case, if something similar happens to you, in a Tesla or any other car with subscription-activated features, be sure to drop us a line.</p><p><em>Got a tip?

      <title>The human ear detects half a millisecond delay in sound</title>
      <link>https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/the-human-ear-detects-half-a-millisecond-delay-in-sound</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
            <div><div><h2>Millisecond latency matters</h2>
<p>In the listening experiment, twelve subjects listened to processed and unprocessed sound, and the researchers studied whether participants were able to reliably distinguish between them. The sounds easiest to identify were a castanet, a percussion instrument, and short clicks.</p>
<p>‘The audibility of the level variation of a loudspeaker across frequencies is well known, but the audibility of the group delay variation has been less studied. Variation in the group delay results in certain frequency ranges moving forward or backward in time compared to other frequencies,’ says Aalto University Professor <strong>Vesa Välimäki</strong>.</p>
<p>Researchers recognise that audio is delayed as a function of frequency as it passes through a loudspeaker, but questions have remained on how audible the resulting delay variations in audio are at different frequencies.</p>
<p>‘The study shows that people can hear differences when audio starts at certain frequencies ahead of time. A half of a millisecond delay in certain frequencies relative to others was also audible. The amount of delay needed to exceed the detection threshold varies considerably at different frequencies, but delays were especially heard when sounds started or stopped,’ Välimäki and Liski say when discussing the results.</p>
<p>The development of digital signal processing has enabled very precise sound processing, opening new possibilities for acoustics research and development.</p>
<p>‘The main goal for our development work is to reproduce complete audio that has been recorded, but nothing extra. It is vital that loudspeakers can create a precise stereo sound stage and reproducing time-accurate sound is a central part of this. Research collaboration with Aalto University deepens our understanding of the accuracy requirements needed to design loudspeakers. We are interested in the limit beyond which a person can no longer perceive improvements when the time precision in reproduced sound improves,’ says <strong>Aki Mäkivirta</strong>, Genelec&#39;s R&amp;D director.</p>
<p>The results of the study have been published in the industry-leading IEEE / ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. You can read the Open Access article <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9450008" target="_blank">from this link</a></p>
<p>Perceiving auditory delays has been studied at the Aalto University Acoustics Laboratory in recent years in the IMPRESS and IMPRESS2 projects funded by Genelec.</p>

      <title>Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Phone Numbers (2016)</title>
      <link>https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/FALSEHOODS.md</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>... and tips on how to use libphonenumber.</p><p>Given how ubiquitous phone numbers are and how long they&#39;ve been around, it&#39;s
surprising how many false assumptions programmers continue to make about them.</p><div>
<li>
<p><strong>An individual has a phone number</strong></p>
<p>Some people do not own phones, or do not wish to provide you with their
telephone number when asked. Do not require a user to provide a phone number
unless it is essential, and whenever possible try to provide a fallback
to accommodate these users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You can make a call to any phone number</strong></p>
<p>Some devices such as EFTPOS terminals, fax machines and mobile internet
dongles may not support receiving calls. In addition, some people can not
use their phones for phone calls. This may be permanent (such as a hearing
disability), temporary (temporary hearing loss) or situational (when the
user is in a noisy environment).</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make how you use phone numbers apparent to the user and give them
the option to set their preference. Ensure that you look up this preference
before attempting to communicate with the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An individual has only one phone number</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, this isn&#39;t necessarily true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A phone number uniquely identifies an individual</strong></p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t even that long ago that mobile phones didn&#39;t exist, and it was
common for an entire household to share one fixed-line telephone number. In
some parts of the world, this is still true, and relatives (or even friends)
share a single phone number. Many phone services (especially for businesses)
allow multiple inbound calls to or outbound calls from the same phone
number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers cannot be re-used</strong></p>
<p>Old phone numbers are recycled and get reassigned to other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers that are valid today will always be valid. Phone numbers of
a certain type today (e.g., mobile) will never be reassigned to another
type.</strong></p>
<p>A phone number which connects today may be disconnected tomorrow. A number
which is free to call today may cost money to call tomorrow. The phone
company may decide to expand the range of available phone numbers by
inserting a digit into an existing number.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t store properties for a phone number such as validity or
type. Check this information again from the library when you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each country calling code corresponds to exactly one country</strong></p>
<p>The USA, Canada, and several Caribbean islands share the country calling
code +1. Russia and Kazakhstan share +7. These are not the only examples!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each country has only one country calling code</strong></p>
<p>As of this present moment (in Mar. 2016), phones in the disputed territory
and partially recognised state of Kosovo may be reached by dialing the
country calling code for Serbia (+381), Slovenia (+386), or Monaco (+377),
depending on where and when one obtained the number.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a phone widget to encourage users to enter their phone number
in an international format such that it can be unambiguously understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A phone number is dialable from anywhere</strong></p>
<p>Some numbers can only be dialed within the country. Some can only be dialled
from within a subset of countries, such as the +800 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number#Universal_International_Freephone_Service" rel="nofollow">Universal
International Freephone Numbers</a>.
Some may be dialable only if the caller is a subscriber to a particular
telecom company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You can send a text message to any phone number</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people still only have a fixed-line telephone, which typically cannot
send or receive text messages.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Whenever possible, try to accommodate these users by calling them
with a voice message or voice prompts. Alternatively, if your service
requires sending text messages, verify that the number can receive text
messages after the user provides it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Only mobile phones can receive text messages</strong></p>
<p>Some service providers support sending and receiving text messages to fixed-line
numbers. There are also online services like Skype that can send and receive
text messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are only two ways to dial a phone number: domestically and from
overseas</strong></p>
<p>Some numbers may need different prefixes depending on: the carrier you are
using; what device you are dialling from/to; whether you are inside or
outside a particular geographical region.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Brazil, to dial numbers internally but across a certain geographical
boundary, a carrier code must be explicitly dialed to say which carrier
you will use to pay for the call.</li>
<li>In Nepal, the leading zero in national format is omitted depending on
whether the originating phone is mobile or fixed-line.</li>
<li>In New Zealand, you need to dial the area-code (e.g. 03) even if the
number is within the same area-code region as you are, unless it is
&#34;close&#34; (something approximating city/district boundaries), in which
case it shouldn’t be dialled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use formatForMobileDialling to get the number a user should
actually dial on their mobile phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To make a number dialable, you only need to change the prefix</strong></p>
<p>In Argentina, to dial a mobile number domestically, the digits &#34;15&#34; need to
be inserted <em>after</em> the area code but <em>before</em> the local number, and the &#34;9&#34;
after the country code (54) needs to be removed. This transforms +54 9 2982
123456 into 02982 15 123456.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No prefix of a valid phone number can be a valid phone number</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, it&#39;s possible to connect to a different endpoint by
dialing more digits after a number. So &#34;12345678&#34; may not reach the same
person as dialing &#34;123456&#34;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An invalid number will not reach an endpoint</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, or on some phones, extra digits are thrown away. Hence,
1-800-MICROSOFT is an invalid number - but it still connects to Microsoft,
since any later digits are ignored. Numbers such as &#34;911&#34; can be reached by
dialling &#34;911 123&#34; in some countries: but not in others.</p>
<p>In other countries, invalid numbers may be &#34;fixed&#34; by a carrier, e.g.,
adding a mobile token if they know it is a mobile number, such that it
connects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All valid phone numbers follow the ITU specifications</strong></p>
<p>ITU-T specifies that a phone number cannot be longer than fifteen digits,
with one to three digits reserved for the country calling code, but valid
numbers in Germany have been assigned that are longer than this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All valid phone numbers belong to a country</strong></p>
<p>There are many &#34;country calling codes&#34; issued to non-geographical entities,
such as satellite services, and the &#34;800&#34; code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number#Universal_International_Freephone_Service" rel="nofollow">Universal International
Freephone Numbers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers contain only digits</strong></p>
<p>In Israel, certain advertising numbers start with a <code>*</code>. In New Zealand,
non-urgent traffic incidents can be reported by calling <code>*555</code> from a mobile
phone. Alpha characters may also be used in phone numbers, such as in
<code>1-800-Flowers</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers are always written in ASCII</strong></p>
<p>In Egypt, it is common for phone numbers to be written in native digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers have only one prefix (area code or national destination
code) at a given time</strong></p>
<p>In the mid-90s in Iceland, phone numbers changed from 5 and 6 digits to 7
digits. The old system had regional prefixes, but the new one doesn&#39;t.
During the transition period, phone numbers could be reached by the old area
code or the new 7 digit number (a different prefix).  For example, a
Reykjavik phone number could be dialed with <code>nnnnn</code> and <code>55nnnnn</code> inside the
region, and <code>91-nnnnn</code> and <code>55nnnnn</code> from outside.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> During transition periods, make sure that both forms of a number
are supported for look-up by phone number. If sending messages/dialling
affected numbers, both the new and old prefix may need to be tried.
Depending on the type of transition, you may need to contact affected
customers and ask them to update their number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A leading zero in numbers formatted for domestic usage can always be
discarded when dialing from abroad</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, people write the national prefix in brackets (typically
<code>(0)</code>) after the country calling code to indicate that it should be
discarded when dialing internationally. In Italy, since 1998, the prefix was
&#34;fixed&#34; to the phone numbers, so that <code>(01) 2345</code> became <code>012345</code> and should
be dialed (internationally) as <code>+39012345</code> (including the leading zero).</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the library to parse and format numbers to handle this
correctly for every country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The country or area code of a phone number indicates the user&#39;s location,
place of residence, time-zone, or preferred language</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons for someone to have a phone number issued in a state
or region other than where they reside or hold citizenship.</p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Moving within a country</em>: In countries with phone number portability,
you may retain your number when moving, even in some cases if it is a
fixed-line number and even if it has an area code (see
<em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1129/" rel="nofollow">xkcd</a></em> for a US example.)</li>
<li><em>Moving to another country</em>: Some people keep their mobile phones when
they move to another country.</li>
<li><em>Geopolitical turmoil</em>: Sometimes countries change their borders, cease
to exist, or come into existence.</li>
<li><em>Business, family, and friends</em>: A business may have many customers in a
neighbouring country, or a person may have many family and friends
there.</li>
<li><em>Wanting cheaper rates</em>: VoIP is often cheaper than regular calls.
People traveling around Europe may get a SIM card from one country and
have a roaming plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that geographical area codes are assigned in some countries to mobile phones.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Programmers should not disallow users from signing up with a phone
number merely because it belongs to another country. Care should be taken
when calling methods such as <code>isValidNumberForRegion</code> that this is what&#39;s
actually intended. If you have a phone input widget, make sure you allow
numbers to be entered in international format (i.e., allow the <code>+</code> sign) so
people can sign up with an international contact number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The plus sign in front of phone numbers in international format is
optional, or can always be replaced by <code>00</code></strong></p>
<p>The plus sign is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164" rel="nofollow">E.164
format</a> for international telephone
numbers. It can be replaced with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes" rel="nofollow">international call
prefix</a>
when dialing internationally. Note that while <code>00</code> is a common international
call prefix, this actually varies by country.</p>
<p>In North America, which has a country calling code of <code>+1</code>, it is a common
error to drop the <code>+</code> in front of the number and write it like
<code>1-555-123-4567</code>. This is technically incorrect. To call this number from
Japan, where the international call prefix is <code>010</code>, one may dial either <code>+1 555 123 4567</code> or <code>010 1 555 123 4567</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Users will only store phone numbers in your product&#39;s phone number fields</strong></p>
<p>Some users use their contact lists to store things like birthdays or other
information. Unless a piece of user-supplied data has actually been verified
to be a phone number, it should be stored as-is as entered by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers are numbers</strong></p>
<p>Never try to store phone numbers as an int or any other kind of numeric
data type. You can&#39;t do arithmetic on them, and while 007, 07 and 7 are the
same number they are not necessarily the same phone number - in some
countries a leading 0 is significant and forms part of the number itself
(see <em>A leading zero in numbers formatted for domestic usage can always be
discarded when dialing from abroad</em>). Moreover, a phone number may contain
other diallable characters (see <em>Phone numbers contain only digits</em>) or an
extension portion, dialled after waiting for a tone.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the library to parse and format numbers to handle this
correctly for every country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbering plans published by governments or telecoms represent
reality</strong></p>
<p>National numbering plans, such as those administered by the
<a href="http://www.itu.int/oth/T0202.aspx?parent=T0202" rel="nofollow">ITU</a>, represent the
intentions of the government or telecom. These may be published before,
during, or after the actual implementation of numbering plan changes in the
real world. The actual date on which a phone number range becomes active may
not always adhere to official announcements.</p>

<p>A top communications manager at Facebook helped Gov. Andrew Cuomo fight sexual misconduct allegations — including by helping leak confidential files about accuser Lindsey Boylan and by participating in regular discussions about Cuomo’s communications strategy, according to the New York attorney general’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/ag-to-release-report-on-andrew-cuomo-sex-harass-probe-sources/">bombshell investigation</a>. </p>



<p>Dani Lever — who had worked in Cuomo’s press operation since 2014 but left in August 2020 to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/07/another-top-aide-leaves-cuomo-as-governors-office-shuffles-ranks/">join Facebook</a> as a communications manager — played a key role in Cuomo’s communications strategy even while working for Facebook, according to the investigation released Tuesday. </p>



<p>In December 2020, former Cuomo staffer Lindsey Boylan <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/13/lindsey-boylan-alleges-cuomo-sexually-harassed-her-about-looks/">became the first of several women to accuse</a> the governor of sexual harassment. Hours later, Cuomo communications director Rich Azzopardi decided to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/cuomo-allies-attempted-to-smear-first-sex-harass-accuser-ag-report/">send Boylan’s confidential personnel files</a> to several journalists in what investigators called an attempt to “discredit and disparage” her. </p>


<figure id="attachment_19018962"><a href="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/dani-lever-facebook-cuomo-01.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all"></a><figcaption><span>Dani Lever (right) helped Gov. Andrew Cuomo leak confidential files about a woman who accused him of sexual harassment, according to the attorney general’s bombshell investigation.</span><span>Office of Governor Andrew M. Cuo</span></figcaption></figure>


<p>According to the attorney general’s report, Lever helped Cuomo’s staffers disseminate the files — even though she had already been working at Facebook for months. </p>



<div><figure><figcaption>Dani Lever left Cuomo’s office for Facebook in August 2020.</figcaption><figcaption><span>Linkedin</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Ms. Lever coordinated with some of the reporters who received the documents to let them know that the Executive Chamber would be sending them,” reads the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf">report</a>. </p>



<p>The smear attempt came amid Lever’s broader participation in Cuomo’s defense as part of a “team of advisors from within and outside the Chamber [who] had ongoing and regular discussions about how to respond to the allegations publicly” that also included Cuomo’s CNN host brother Chris, according to the attorney general. Lever’s name appears 25 times in the attorney general’s report. </p>



<p>Reached by phone, Lever told The Post she could not talk because she had to attend a meeting. Lever and Facebook’s broader press team did not immediately reply to questions sent by email, including about whether Lever had Facebook’s permission to work with the governor. </p>



<figure><figcaption>While working at Facebook, Dani Lever helped leak confidential personnel files about former Cuomo aide and sexual harassment accuser Lindsey Boylan, pictured above, in an attempt to “discredit and disparage” her, according to the investigation. </figcaption><figcaption><span>AP</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the days after Boylan first accused Gov. Cuomo of misconduct, the governor’s team reportedly worked on a draft letter or op-ed that included complaints against Boylan from her confidential personnel files, as well as unspecified interactions between the accuser and her male colleagues. Drafts of the letter also “impugned her credibility” and suggested that she could be working with supporters of then-President Donald Trump and a politician who wanted to unseat Cuomo as governor, according to the attorney general’s investigation. </p>



<p>Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa then allegedly sent a version of the letter to several people including Lever, asking her to sign it. </p>



<p>Lever — who served as Cuomo’s first ever female press secretary in 2016 — declined to put her name on the letter, suggesting that it amounted to “victim shaming,” according to the investigation. </p>



<p>However Lever signed a different statement in support of Cuomo in February, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/24/ex-aide-details-sexual-harassment-allegations-against-cuomo/">disputing Boylan’s accusation that the governor suggested they play “strip poker”</a> while on a taxpayer-funded jet in 2017. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Dani Lever worked for Gov. Andrew Cuomo from 2014 to 2020. </figcaption><figcaption><span>Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“We were on each of these October flights and this conversation did not happen,” Lever said in a joint statement with other former and current aides John Maggiore, Howard Zemsky and and Abbey Fashouer Collins. </p>



<p>Investigators also said that Lever was copied on internal emails about communications strategy and participated in at least one conference call with Cuomo staffers.</p>



<p>In the damning report — which has led to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/biden-says-cuomo-should-resign-hours-after-harassment-report/">calls for Cuomo’s resignation from President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/eric-adams-says-cuomo-should-be-impeached-if-he-doesnt-resign/">Democratic New York City mayoral nominee Eric Adams</a>, among dozens of <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/neighboring-govs-call-on-cuomo-to-resign-over-sex-harassment/">other politicians</a> — investigators suggest that Lever and other outside advisors enjoyed an inappropriate level of access to Cuomo. </p>



<p>“None of them was officially retained in any capacity by the Executive Chamber or any of the individuals involved,” the investigators wrote of Lever, Chris Cuomo and other outside advisors. “Nonetheless, they were regularly provided with confidential and often privileged information about state operations and helped make decisions that impacted State business and employees — all without any formal role, duty, or obligation to the State.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Accusations of sexual misconduct against Gov. Andrew Cuomo have led to widespread calls for the governor to resign. </figcaption><figcaption><span>REUTERS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lever joined Facebook to manage the company’s responses to breaking issues related to products and policies as part of a team called Strategic Response Communications, the New York Daily News <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-cuomo-communications-director-dani-lever-facebook-20200807-3fjx5b2fobetdnrmk3wgunswzm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> last year when she left Cuomo’s office. </p>



<p>Prior to joining Cuomo’s office in 2014, Lever worked as a press assistant for President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign and worked in press relations at the Clinton Foundation, among other roles, according to her LinkedIn profile. </p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Lets say you have a 64-bit integer. You want the first 42-bits. Now, if your language has a bitshift operator, you&#39;d be tempted to do something like <code>largeNumber &gt;&gt; 22</code>.</p>
<p>But what if your language <em>also</em> has all sorts of advanced stream processing and map functions? It&#39;d be a shame to not use those. <strong>Tarah</strong>&#39;s shop uses Rust, and thus they do have all those exciting advanced stream processing. Her co-worker decided they just <em>needed</em> to be used:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span> binary = <span>format!</span>(<span>&#34;{:b}&#34;</span>, snowflake);
<span>let</span> in_binary: <span>u64</span> = binary[..<span>42</span>]
    .to_string()
    .chars()
    .rev()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(idx, digit)| {
        (<span>u64</span>::from_str_radix(&amp;digit.to_string(), <span>2</span>).unwrap()) * ((<span>2_u64</span>).pow(idx <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>))
    })
    .sum();
</p></code></pre>
<p>This starts by taking a number, and converting it into a string containing the binary representation. Then we chop off the first 42 characters of that string, break them into characters, reverse the stream, enumerate it, and then apply a <code>map</code> where we parse each character back into a number (which will be 0 or 1), and then multiply it by two raised to the power of the index we&#39;re on. <code>sum</code> all that up, and we&#39;ve got the first 42 bits of a 64-bit number.</p>
<p>And sure, <code>snowflake &gt;&gt; 22</code> would be shorter, clearer, and far more efficient, but it wouldn&#39;t let you show off all the cool language features you have at your disposal, and isn&#39;t that what&#39;s really important?</p>

        <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>→ <em><a href="https://racket.com/maguay/rnhFE">Listen to this story on Racket</a>.</em></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It was a plaything for the wealthy, a tool for the powerful, hailed as a democratic gift to humanity.</p><p>It was geeky, technical, jargonistic. You’d debate the merits of the smallest changes, remix and reinvent, preorder the latest model months in advance, then watch the shipping date slip further into the future.</p><p>It spurred innovators to greatness and grandiose. “There are no imaginable limits to our opportunities,” a government commissioner would enthuse.” “I aim at Tesla,” said the <a href="https://archive.org/details/empireofairmenwh00lewi">self-styled father</a> of this new technology.</p><p>It would bring the best of times; nothing else could possibly “touch the lives of all people more intimately,” as <a href="https://archive.org/details/RadioEntersTheHome/page/n9/mode/2up?q=peace">one put it</a>. It’d also bring the worst of times; it could “suppress and distort fact,” even “stir up mob violence,” <a href="https://archive.org/details/radioannual193900radi/page/40/mode/2up?q=mob">another worried</a>.</p><p>We were promised driverless vehicles a century ago, and all we got was the radio.</p><h2 id="into-the-ether">Into the ether</h2><figure></figure><p>It started out as a spark. We’d tamed lightening, as our ancestors had tamed fire. We’d brightened the darkness, built the first automobiles, sent messages on wires coast to coast.</p><p>“Do you think there is a limit to the possibility of electricity?” <a href="https://archive.org/details/phonoscope13hunt/page/n9/mode/2up">Thomas Edison was asked in 1896</a>. “No,” replied Edison, “I do not.”</p><p>Edison then fretted that the next innovations might not surprise us; “Nothing now seems to be too great for the people to comprehend.”</p><p>He needn’t have worried. “Tesla foretold of a day,” Thomas S. W. Lewis <a href="https://archive.org/details/empireofairmenwh00lewi">wrote</a> of Edison’s archrival, “the seemingly magic electrons would enable messages and sounds to be sent across great distances without wires.” That’d spark the next generation of innovations, kick off a tech cycle that’d transform the world—or so they dreamed.</p><blockquote>“The possibilities of wireless radiations are enormous.”</blockquote><p>It started out with wireless Twitter—or rather, with Guglielmo Marconi’s wireless telegraph, sold first to the British Navy in 1897, then used in 1899 to report on international yacht races. “The possibilities of wireless radiations are enormous,” <a href="http://bnrg.cs.berkeley.edu/~randy/Courses/CS39C.S97/radio/radio.html">said Marconi</a> to a reporter. Then he started the first wireless company, sent a transatlantic message through the air two years later.</p><p>And the race was on.</p><h2 id="tinker-transmitter">Tinker, transmitter</h2><p>First came ego and eccentrics. “Some days I don’t sleep,” Edison would claim when asked about his work/life balance. “I must be brilliant, win fame,” wrote Lee de Forest, the self-styled father of radio, in his journal. “I aim at Tesla.”</p><p>But maybe it takes the crazy ones. You can’t just invent the future; you have to sell it, too. Marconi was ready for both, with “the vision to harness the discoveries of others” and add a few of his own, combined that with “the skill of a P.T Barnum” to promote the ideas.</p><p>So you’d try crazy things until something worked. Marconi “absently placed one part of his aerial on the ground while holding the other part in the air,” and voilà, antennae would live on roofs for the following century.</p><blockquote>“I aim at Tesla.”</blockquote><p>You’d remix. Edison discovered the “Edison effect” as carbon passed from a lightbulb’s filament to the glass bulb, John Fleming turned that into the diode, then de Forest perfected it with a battery, circuit, and zig-zagged nickel wire to amplify the radio signal with his audion—an early take on the triode that lives on today in high-end amps.</p><p>It was geeky, a hacker’s paradise of parts and schematics, a new frontier where you could broadcast your ideas. You had to learn new science, of intercepting signals, tuning into broadcasts, amplifying it into audio. It wasn’t for everyone; it was for those who took the time to obsess over the smallest details in journals like <em>The Phonoscope</em>, <em>Wireless Age</em>, and <em>Radio Annual</em>.</p><p>It was eccentric, the next big thing.</p><h2 id="the-hopes-and-fears-of-all-the-years">The hopes and fears of all the years</h2><figure></figure><p>And then radio was everywhere, the new thing everyone couldn’t get enough of. “Soon the human ear and imagination became insatiable,” wrote Lewis of the radio. “People wanted more of everything—music, talk, advice, drama.”</p><p>It’d <a href="https://archive.org/stream/servicebulletin7175unit/servicebulletin7175unit_djvu.txt">rescue you</a>, from shipwreck and snowstorm, fire and flood. It’d <a href="https://archive.org/details/RadioEntersTheHome/page/n9/mode/2up?q=peace">educate</a>; “There are no imaginable limits to our opportunities,” enthused the US Commissioner of Education J.W. Studebaker.</p><p>It promised a driverless future, even. “Steer a ship from a distance?” repeated New York Herald reporter to Guglielmo Marconi, after his comment about the potential of the wireless telegraph. “Certainly.”</p><p>And yet, the dreams were paired with anxiety. Governments <a href="https://archive.org/details/WirelessAgeVol02/page/n47/mode/2up">imagined</a> radio’s potential for spying; citizens worried it could tell their darkest secrets. “It’s going to be embarrassing if the collection agencies start a broadcasting station” and broadcast the names of debtors, a letter to the New York Telegram imagined.</p><p>Radio, indeed, could threaten everything. It could “threaten our whole telephone system, I may add, our whole newspaper system,” theorized a chief Marconi engineer.</p><blockquote>“Radio, in a democracy, is of tremendous importance, of far larger importance than we yet realize.”</blockquote><p>Fake news became the new worry. Radio “can inform accurately and so lead sound public opinion; or it can suppress and distort fact and so grossly mislead its hearers,” wrote <a href="https://archive.org/details/radioannual193900radi/page/40/mode/2up?q=mob">National Broadcasting Co.’s Dr. James Angell in 1939</a>. “It can stir up mob excitement, even to the point of violence,” he said without citation.</p><p>Freedom itself was in question. “Radio, in a democracy, is of tremendous importance, of far larger importance than we yet realize,” wrote H.V. Kaltenborn in the same publication. And so, National Broadcasting’s Angell questioned, should radio be “controlled by the rulers,” or should it be free, or free but with the oversight that it is “never abused?”</p><p>Even equipment came up for debate. Should ships rent radios, or buy them? “The French pride possession,” a <a href="https://archive.org/details/WirelessAgeVol02/page/n111/mode/2up">debater argued</a>, while “In this country we get better service and better terms by renting our radios,” debates that echo those over smartphone subsidies a century later.</p><p>We’d gone from wires to wireless in a couple decades, from debating how to build the best radio to how it should be used. Frequencies and filaments took a backseat to policy and practice.</p><p>And just as quickly, it faded into the background as just another part of life—important, a new part of the fabric of society, even, yet hardly as consequential as was once imagined.</p><p>It was just the radio, after all.</p><h2 id="i-am-for-peace-but-when-i-speak%E2%80%A6">I am for peace, but when I speak…</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>There’s something deeply human about overestimating the change new technology will bring.</p><p>“In the future there need be no disputed readings, no doubtful interpretation of text or delivery,” wrote <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/phonoscope13hunt/page/n9/mode/2up">The Phonoscope</a></em>’s inaugural edition in 1896. “Death has lost some of its sting since we are able to forever retain the voices of the dead.”</p><p>And that was for the phonograph, with voices etched in resin.</p><p>Radio elicited loftier ideas. de Forest was driven by visions of a utopia, one with “no war … easy &amp; rapid &amp; cheap transit.” Tesla, at a Radio Institute dinner in 1915 on the eve of World War I, <a href="https://archive.org/details/WirelessAgeVol02/page/n435/mode/2up?q=peace">hoped</a> that “wireless would prove an agent of peace in binding the nations closer together,” even as the gathering included “many nationalities, notably those of belligerent countries,” even as Marconi—the inventor of wireless telegraphs—had arrived to New York for the event aboard the Lusitania.</p><p>13 days later, the illusion shattered, as a German U-boat’s torpedo sank the Lusitania and brought America into the war. Soon the United States would be <a href="https://archive.org/details/n10wirelessage04nyne/page/728/mode/2up">recruiting radio operators</a>, adding <em>Radioman</em> as a new rank in the Navy.</p><p>The tide of the Great War, nay history, was turned on the airwaves. Peace would come, but radio would have to be battle-tested first.</p><p>And then we’d dream again. Even before the dust settled, the 1918’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radio-Telephony-Alfred-N-Goldsmith/dp/0548479267">Radio Telephony</a></em> textbook was dedicated to radio as the “promoter of mutual acquaintance, of peace and good will among men and nations.” The dream of technology changing the world would live on.</p><p>Lasting peace proved elusive, technology regardless. War or the rumor thereof, if anything, provided the spark and sponsorship to push technology forward.</p><p>Then came the computer, to crack wartime codes and calculate where bombs would burst and tabulate first the government then the international business world’s data. Then came rockets and the space race, ostensibly to put a man on the moon—or a missile on your foe. Then came the semiconductor, to fuel that space race, then be the brains behind the software that would eat the world.</p><p>And once again, we’d decry the privacy implications of the latest technology, puzzle the geopolitical ramifications of who owns and who copies the technology, worry it was ruining everything. And we’d dream again that it’d be the end-all, cure everything, bring the world together, make our self-driving vehicles actually happen this time. It’d bring out the best and worst of us.</p><p>And perhaps, like radio, decades later it’d be just a thing, a bit of nostalgia, something that got us through our days, something that occasionally made everything better and other times made everything worse.</p><p>It’d be like everything else humans make. Soon enough, we’d move on to the next greatest thing.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>→ <em><a href="https://racket.com/maguay/rnhFE">Listen to this story on Racket</a>.</em></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr/><blockquote>Get your voice on the air.

While that would have been the pinnacle for most female monkeys, Yakei decided to throw her 10kg weight around among the males.</p><p>In late June, she challenged and roughed up Sanchu, the 31-year-old alpha male who had been leader of “troop B” at the reserve for five years.</p><figure id="08c24c1c-41a0-4cbf-8ba1-977fdccfdfe4"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-3 | 3" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></figure><p>Surprised wardens at Takasakiyama, where there has never been a female monkey boss in the reserve’s 70-year history, carried out a “peanut test” on 30 June, putting out nuts for the group and seeing who ate first.

      <title>Declined invitations go over more graciously when lack of money is cited</title>
      <link>https://theconversation.com/declined-invitations-go-over-more-graciously-when-lack-of-money-is-cited-instead-of-lack-of-time-new-research-164473</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>The <a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231">Research Brief</a> is a short take about interesting academic work.</em></p>

<h2>The big idea</h2>

<p>Declining an invitation by saying “I don’t have time” leads the person you rejected to feel undervalued and upset, making them trust you less and hurting the relationship, we found in <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1226">research recently published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology</a>. Offering a financial excuse such as “I don’t have money” doesn’t create the same negative reaction. </p>

<p>To explore the best way to decline an invitation without damaging a relationship, we conducted six experiments with a focus on two common excuses: time and money.</p>

<p>First, we invited 207 people into our lab and asked them to recall an experience when an acquaintance declined to do something with them, citing an excuse of either limited time or money. We then asked participants to rate how close they felt to the person and how much they trusted them before and after hearing the excuse. We also asked how valid they deemed the excuse. </p>

<p>Participants felt less close to their acquaintances and trusted them less when they used a time excuse rather than a money excuse as a reason they couldn’t do something. They also said a time excuse was less valid. </p>

<p>In a second experiment, we recruited 132 people who were engaged and planning a wedding. We asked them how many guests declined the invitation and if they provided a time or money excuse. Again, people taking part in this study felt less close and trusting of those who used a lack of time as their excuse for not attending the wedding. Participants also indicated that they believe money was significantly more outside of their guests’ control. </p>

<p>We found similar results with three other experiments that examined a scenario in which someone declined an invitation to have dinner, drinks or see a comedy show.</p>

<p>A sixth experiment found that people who cited not having enough time as the reason they aren’t more charitable were perceived as less trustworthy. They were also seen as having more actual control over their constraints than when they cited a lack of money. </p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>We’ve all received an invitation to an event or been asked to do a favor for a friend but didn’t have the time, money or perhaps even the interest. But <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/insights/i/fomo-spending-affects-one-in-four-millennials">saying “no” isn’t so easy</a> for any number of reasons. </p>

<p>Our research suggests that turning down invitations because of a lack of time – even when true – seems to reflect the weakness of the relationship. You might as well say, “I value doing something else rather than spending time with you.”</p>

<p>But we also found that when time is a factor, providing a friend with more information about your time constraints can help, such as mentioning a tight deadline at work. That shows the constraint is outside of your control. </p>

<h2>What other research is being done</h2>

<p>While our research shows citing money is a more acceptable excuse, there are other reasons why someone might not want to use a lack of cash as a reason to decline a night out or something else. </p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucy040">Recent research</a> suggests that financially constrained people don’t like to talk about their purchasing behavior because it reminds them of their relative lack of wealth. This makes them less likely to use it as an excuse – and sometimes go out anyway – even when doing so adds to their financial stress. </p>

<p>In one of our experiments, we found that people saw having too little money as less of an obstacle than time constraints. Some participants with friends who declined an invitation over a lack of money expressed a willingness to pick up their companion’s bill or to suggest a less expensive activity.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The number of Americans who renounced their citizenship in favor of a foreign country hit an all-time high in 2020: 6,707, a 237% increase over 2019.</p><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>While the numbers are down this year, that&#39;s probably because many U.S. embassies and consulates remain closed for COVID-19, and taking this grave step requires taking an oath in front of a State Department officer.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The people who flee tend to be ultra-wealthy, and many of them are seeking to reduce their tax burden. New tax and estate measures <a data-vars-link-text="proposed" data-vars-click-url="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-administration-tax-proposals/" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-administration-tax-proposals/" target="_blank">proposed</a> by the Biden administration could, if implemented, accelerate this trend.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Only the U.S. and Eritrea tax people based on citizenship rather than residency. For most countries, if you are a citizen but don’t reside there, you aren’t taxed in that country. </p><p><strong>Where it stands: </strong>The IRS publishes a <a data-vars-link-text="quarterly list" data-vars-click-url="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/29/2021-16201/quarterly-publication-of-individuals-who-have-chosen-to-expatriate-as-required-by-section-6039g" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/29/2021-16201/quarterly-publication-of-individuals-who-have-chosen-to-expatriate-as-required-by-section-6039g" target="_blank">quarterly list</a> of the names of people who have renounced their citizenship or given up their green cards, but it only includes people with global assets over $2 million. </p><ul><li>The numbers started swelling in 2010, when Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, which increased reporting requirements and penalties for expats.</li><li>FATCA &#34;kind of flushed people out of the bushes,&#34; says Andrew Mitchel, an international tax lawyer based in Connecticut who tracks the numbers. It &#34;effectively deputized all the banks around the world to tattletale on U.S. citizens.&#34;</li><li>But the Wall Street Journal <a data-vars-link-text="discovered" data-vars-click-url="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-americans-are-renouncing-their-citizenship-11602840602" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-americans-are-renouncing-their-citizenship-11602840602" target="_blank">discovered</a> that the lists aren&#39;t up to date: A lot of people who were reported to have renounced citizenship in 2020 actually did so years earlier.</li><li>&#34;It’s not as if the latest quarter names that have come out are indicative of the current political environment or anything like that,&#34; Mitchel tells Axios.</li></ul><p><strong>What they&#39;re saying:</strong> David Lesperance, an international tax lawyer based in Poland who specializes in helping people renounce U.S. citizenship, says that with coronavirus shutting down interviews for renunciation, the next lists will only contain relinquished green card holders, who can do it by mail. </p><ul><li>&#34;There are probably 20,000 or 30,000 people who want to do this, but they can’t get the appointment,&#34; Lesperance said. &#34;There’s not a peak demand — the system’s capacity has peaked.&#34;</li><li>&#34;It&#39;s a year-and-a-half to get an appointment at a Canadian embassy,&#34; he tells Axios. &#34;Bern [Switzerland] alone has a backlog of over 300 cases.&#34;</li><li>Lesperance, who has been helping people renounce citizenship for 30 years, says the pandemic has made it hard to help clients navigate the lengthy and complicated process, which involves first getting citizenship in another country.</li></ul><p><strong>Be smart: </strong>The State Department <a data-vars-link-text="strongly discourages" data-vars-click-url="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Renunciation-US-Nationality-Abroad.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Renunciation-US-Nationality-Abroad.html" target="_blank">strongly discourages</a> people from severing themselves from the protections and privileges that U.S. citizenship affords (and that so many migrants, Dreamers and others are seeking to obtain).</p><ul><li>&#34;We usually advise against it,&#34; Ashkan Yekrangi, an immigration lawyer based in Orange County, tells Axios. &#34;The bulk of the cases are individuals trying to avoid tax liability.&#34;</li><li>A lot of people who take this drastic step are tech zillionaires: Eric Schmidt, the former Alphabet CEO, has <a data-vars-link-text="applied" data-vars-click-url="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/9/21547055/eric-schmidt-google-citizen-cyprus-european-union" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/9/21547055/eric-schmidt-google-citizen-cyprus-european-union" target="_blank">applied</a> to become a citizen of Cyprus.</li><li>The State Department is tight-lipped about the numbers and what they mean. <strong>&#34;</strong>Since embassies or websites offer appointments on a first-come, first-served basis as local conditions permit, we do not track &#39;pent-up demand&#39; for U.S. citizenship renunciations,&#34; an official told Axios.</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>President Biden has <a data-vars-link-text="proposed" data-vars-click-url="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/biden-budget-reiterates-top-capital-gains-tax-rate.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/biden-budget-reiterates-top-capital-gains-tax-rate.html" target="_blank">proposed</a> raising the top capital gains tax to 43.4%, and while it&#39;s unclear whether that will pass, it did prompt a lot of calls to Lesperance from people wanting to find out which foreign countries might grant them citizenship. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="SpecialReportArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="SpecialReportArticle-articleBody-6-2"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106880564" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>Thomas Trutschel | Photothek | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div><p>Ethereum&#39;s much-hyped and somewhat controversial &#34;London&#34; hard fork has just activated.</p><p>So far, news of the successful upgrade has coincided with a runup<strong> </strong>in the price of ether, the native token of ethereum&#39;s blockchain. The cryptocurrency is at $2,620<strong>, </strong>up 3.9% in the last 24 hours.</p><p>A big part of the enthusiasm has to do with the fact that the software upgrade means a few big — and necessary — changes are coming to the code underpinning the world&#39;s second-biggest cryptocurrency. </p><p>It has always been a tough go for ethereum users. The blockchain has a long-standing problem with scaling, and its highly unpredictable and sometimes exorbitant transaction fees can annoy even its biggest fans.</p><p>The problem has become worse in recent months thanks to a surge in interest in nonfungible tokens, which are mostly built on ethereum&#39;s blockchain, as well as an explosive growth in the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which also largely uses the ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Thursday&#39;s changes to the code, which has little to do with the city of London, are designed to fix many of these issues by destroying or &#34;burning&#34; ether coins and changing the way transaction fees work so that they are more predictable. </p><p>If you think of ethereum like a highway, London is adding a few lanes to tamp down traffic and is standardizing toll prices. </p><p>&#34;It adds a lot of complexity to the fee logic, but it&#39;s an interesting approach that could potentially stabilize the fee dynamics,&#34; said Nic Carter, Castle Island Ventures general partner and Coin Metrics co-founder.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Making fees more predictable</h2><div><p>Even though the ethereum blockchain gets makeovers all the time — for those keeping track, this marks hard fork #11 — the &#34;London&#34; upgrade is a game changer, according to experts. </p><p>The hard fork itself consists of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals. They are called EIPs for short, and each puts forth a set of changes to the code. </p><p>The one that everyone is latching onto is EIP-1559.</p><p>Before the upgrade, users would essentially participate in an open auction every block, where they would have to place a bid with a miner in something referred to as a &#34;first-price auction.&#34; The closed-bid setting meant that users were often taking a stab in the dark when proposing transaction fees (known as &#34;gas prices&#34;), picking a number that they felt would guarantee their inclusion in the next block of transactions. </p></div><div><p>Some users who felt the need to prioritize their transaction would offer to pay a premium above their bid to try to gain preferred status within the block itself. </p><p>&#34;Fifteen-fifty-nine is really meant to create an ecosystem that encourages lower gas fees,&#34; said Auston Bunsen, co-founder and CTO of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies.</p><p>&#34;Sometimes people are willing to pay a lot to get into a block. Fifteen-fifty-nine seeks to remediate this issue by creating a base fee,&#34; continued Bunsen.</p><p>Rather than holding a blind auction every block to determine the gas price, ethereum&#39;s protocol will algorithmically decide the transaction fee based upon overall demand on the network.</p><p>Having the protocol decide a uniform gas price should prevent major spikes in prices, although that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it will be cheaper for buyers. It is, in essence, one big hedge against the market falling totally out of whack.</p><p>However, the upgrade will still allow for users to jump the queue by tipping.</p><p>But a bigger change fomented by EIP-1559 is a doubling of the block size.</p><p>While in theory, this means that twice the number of transactions can happen in each block, the upgrade has actually been designed so that the protocol only wants the block to be half full. This is meant to help smooth out spikes in demand, helping gas fees to stay stable.</p><p>Matt Hougan, Bitwise Asset Management&#39;s chief investment officer, uses the metaphor of a ferry boat to explain the design logic. </p><p>If the ferry operators have set the price of a ticket too low, they may need all that extra seat capacity to accommodate the passengers standing on the dock who want to hop on board at the base ticket fee.</p><p>&#34;But the price ratchets up very quickly, and algorithmically, to the point where you should get to a clearing price that allows the block to be at its target of half full, and certainly that allows all the transactions that want to go through to be processed,&#34; Hougan explained.</p><p>Making the block size dynamic so that it can accommodate fluctuations in demand is what ultimately stabilizes the base fee.</p><p>&#34;It sounds pretty simple, but it&#39;s a really elegant design solution to a problem that has plagued ethereum since its inception,&#34; he said.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>The ticking time bomb</h2><div><p>The not-so-quiet elephant in the room is the fact that the upgrade redirects a portion of miner income to existing token holders.</p><p>The ether that would otherwise go to the miner will now be &#34;burned,&#34; which permanently destroys a portion of the digital currency that otherwise would be recycled back into circulation.</p><p>Some have made the argument that the EIP-1559 upgrade will create a sort of deflationary pressure on ethereum, because less supply can lead to a rise in price. But this reasoning makes a couple big assumptions.</p><p>&#34;It only creates deflationary pressure under the condition that burned fees actually exceed new issuance,&#34; said Carter. &#34;That&#39;s only the case at times of extreme fee intensity.&#34;</p><p>Carter says that burning gas prices probably wouldn&#39;t end up being net deflationary, at least not under the current fee regime.</p><p>But burning those fees will also mean a major shift for miners, leaving them with really only two revenue streams.</p><p>Miners can still sell their computing power to the network and hope to earn a reward of newly minted ether, should they win a block.</p><p>They can also still receive tips from users looking to prioritize their position within the block.</p><p>But in the short term, miners won&#39;t make quite as much money as they did before the hard fork.</p><p>Hougan argues that because miners are organically linked to the overall value of ethereum, the hope is that they ultimately make up for these losses as the price of ethereum goes up thanks to these protocol changes.</p><p>But experts tell CNBC that the problem with this logic is that in the next few years, ethereum miners are approaching a cliff that will make them obsolete. In fact, included among Thursday&#39;s upgrades is a stipulation that addresses this very mining Armageddon.</p><p>Though it&#39;s not getting the same attention as EIP-1559, another one of the EIPs included in the London fork is EIP-3554 and its significance cannot be understated. This change in the code paves the way for ethereum 2.0, an upgrade and total overhaul of the system, which has been in the works for years. </p><p>Ethereum 2.0 would have the network switch from the energy-intensive &#34;proof-of-work&#34; mining system, where miners solve difficult math equations to create new coins, to &#34;proof-of-stake,&#34; which just requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This change will be huge not just for ethereum, but for the wider cryptocurrency community at large.</p><p>EIP-3554 takes an important deadline that will encourage ethereum miners to upgrade their software to prepare for the switch — known as the &#34;difficulty time bomb&#34; — and moves that deadline from summer 2022 to this December.</p><p>&#34;The point of the difficulty bomb is to force miners and node operators to upgrade their software after a predetermined amount of time has passed,&#34; explained Carter.</p><p>As Bunsen describes it, the proof-of-stake transition would essentially make ethereum unmineable once activated. In other words, a few years from now, once the protocol has fully migrated to a proof-of-stake model, the entire industry around ethereum mining as it exists today will no longer be relevant.</p><p>So why London? The ethereum community has simply taken to naming its hard forks after cities where its Devcon international developer&#39;s conference been held. Next on deck: Shanghai.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___madned_substack_com_p_whats-in-store/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0ea910c-46be-4a13-b300-cb3605be1f9f_1920x1016.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Dynamic Ram Memory Array from a VAX 8600 Mainframe (circa 1984)</figcaption></figure></div><p>It is tempting to spend a lot of time in this article marveling over how small and cheap computer storage has gotten versus the old days.  In the 1980’s when I worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, my first job was to design memories for a mainframe computer.  The system we were building could theoretically have up to 1GB of memory, but we laughed at this idea at the time, because it would require multiple refrigerator-sized cabinets and millions of dollars to build it, and who needs a gigabyte of memory, anyway?</p><p>Now of course, a USB drive in the back of your desk drawer that is only 1GB gets thrown out for being too small, and a suitable replacement can be found for under $10 at the supermarket checkout stand.   I think though that is all the time I’ll devote to talking about this remarkable progression.  Although it still boggles my mind every time I think about the comparison, it’s a thoroughly covered topic.   </p><p>Instead I wanted to rewind even further back, and look at storage systems that are even older than the (admittedly old) stuff I usually write about. Some of these I’ve actually used, but some I’ve just learned about over the years.</p><h3>It Worked On Paper</h3><p>Paper as a storage medium has been around a long time.  Paper rolls to control musical instruments such as pianos date back to the mid 19th century.   IBM got its start building machines that improved upon even older paper-card tabulators from the 1800’s, expanding the size and thus storage of the existing 22-column cards to 80.  They also changed the holes along the way from round to rectangular, and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/punchcard/">IBM punch card</a> was born.  (Also, fun fact, the reason old CRT terminals have 80 columns of text characters)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0b25017-5a26-4ac0-9bd1-c27af52028df_767x345.png"></a><figcaption>An 80-column IBM Paper Punch Card</figcaption></figure></div><p>This format ruled the early information age from the 1920’s all the way up into the 1970s.  (IBM says in the link above that these cards stored all of the worlds information in the first half of the 20th century, but I think they are forgetting about books.) </p><p>I had a brief stint of writing programs on these cards in a COBOL class in the 70’s at our high school.  Using cards as a programming storage medium was already becoming outmoded by then, but still alive and well in the not-so-cutting-edge public school system I was in.  </p><p>The two things I remember about it are, first, the unforgiving nature of making a mistake, which did not allow for a delete key to un-punch a hole, you just started a new card.   The second is what happens if you drop your card deck.  Every line of your program scatters to the floor in random order, and re-sequencing them was a pain.  Each program statement would have a line number on the card so it could be figured out, but reading hundreds of cards and shuffling them around was tedious.  </p><p>If you were lucky, you could use something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_card_sorter">IBM card sorter</a> to do it, but unlikely this critical data processing center equipment would be available for your use in reassembling a deck.  The pros therefore took a big magic marker and drew a diagonal stripe down the side of the deck, so you can visually spot cards out of order.</p><p>I spent more time in the 70’s with another paper format, paper tape.   A paper tape punch was a common peripheral that was attached to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype machines</a>, such as the Model 33 I used in school to write BASIC programs.  The punch and reader both showed up as devices in the equivalent of /dev, and much like UNIX you could just redirect a program onto or off of paper tape.  </p><p>Punching and reading were dead slow, due to the mechanical speed limitations and also the fairly basic encoding used (6 bit ASCII).  But it was a true read/write format, even if you could not erase and reuse the medium. And a lot easier to manage than cards since no typing was involved.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d33c4c7-ca8d-4fbc-8359-797bcef4e71c_3804x2141.jpeg"></a><figcaption>One of the author’s programs from 1980, still on paper tape</figcaption></figure></div><p>Last paper storage device I’ll mention is the printer.  You might not think of a printer as a storage device, but it was very common in the 70’s and even 80’s to share programs by printing them.  The printer was the ‘writer’, and the ‘reader’ would be the guy having to type it back in, which was of course very slow.  But many magazines and books of the time would publish programs in print to share with their readers, and I spent more than a few hours typing in BASIC programs from print, then trying to find all my typos.   </p><p>I recently found a printout of a program I wrote when I was 17, stuck in an old Computer Gaming World magazine from the 80’s.  It was a game I wrote, and I decided to resurrect it and see if I could get it running.  (Spoiler is, I did - but I will be covering that one in another post.)  The thing I find amazing about paper storage format is its longevity.  Card decks and paper tape punched decades ago is still quite viable, provided you can find a way to read it, and provided it did not get wet at any time.  </p><h2>Who’s Going To Hold My Bits?</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53cd5294-0a0a-4b17-bea6-bbd78f30a43e_620x350.jpeg"></a><figcaption>8 Tube Module from an IBM 701 Computer (1952)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Paper is all well and good as a storage medium for the mechanical computer age, but when electronic computers came around in the 1940’s, a faster solution was desirable, at least for main memory, or “store” as it was more commonly referred to back then.  If you think of punch cards as being the large-capacity “disk storage” of the day, it still left a need for a smaller, faster storage device for programs and data that could keep up with the processor (like dynamic ram systems of today).</p><p>Mechanical solutions were out — and electronic ones in.  But there was a problem of scale, since integrated circuits were still twenty years away, and even the transistor had not been invented yet.  Register circuits made out of tubes could be constructed, but it would take at minimum 4-5 tubes and associated discrete components to store a single bit. This was fast but required a lot of space, and a lot of power.  Tens of thousands of tubes just to store a kilobyte of data, creating all sorts of cost, power, thermal, and reliability problems.</p><p>The motivation to build a smaller storage device was high, so they got creative about where they could keep all their bits around for a while.  One of the earliest solutions was, to use a wire.  Slightly more complex, but basically, a wire.  The idea was based off of the principal of wave propagation, where an electrical pulse would take time to travel down a conductor, and if the conductor was long enough, several pulses representing bits could be stored in the wire as they travelled.  </p><p>This technical area is also referred to as transmission line theory, and it later haunted systems engineers like me, because the effects of signals propagating in wires can lead to delays and even reflections that cause timing and signal integrity problems for fast circuits.  The computers of the 1940s though were slow enough that many of these issues were not a problem then.</p><p>This is not to say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory">delay line memory</a> as it was called, was an easy thing to engineer.  There were many problems, the first of which being that a wire, even a long wire, does not store information for very long.  They got around this by building even slower propagation circuits, using chains of capacitors to form an electric delay line.  It could not store a lot of bits, but was relatively cheap and faster than mechanical storage.</p><p>Then things get really strange.  The next invention in this area was something called a <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/vs-univac-mercury-memory.html">mercury delay line</a>, which was basically a big tank of liquid mercury with a piezoelectric crystal on one end, and a microphone on the other.  The crystal would produce a tight-beam sound wave that would propagate through the mercury, which has a very high propagation rate for sound vs. air or water (1450 m/s vs. 340 m/s for air).  </p><p>Pulses of sound would be transmitted into the tank as a serial stream, and read out the other end, amplified, modified, fed back in.  Length of the tube had to be carefully selected so the cycle time of the system was in line with the CPU clock rate, and multiple tubes were needed to store anything more than a hundred or so bits.  </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaca8749-e9a3-4ddd-a3b0-844e98151098_649x319.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Mercury Delay Line from the Univac I Computer (1951)</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Remember What You Saw on TV?</h2><p>By the early 1950’s computers were getting complex enough that they needed more storage, and faster storage.  Delay lines were rather limited in capacity, and the latency of electrical or sound waves propagating through some medium created a fundamental access time limit that was getting in the way of CPU throughput.  Add to that the issues with the serial aspect of memory access, and don’t even start to think about the toxicity issues of having all that mercury around.</p><p>Long way of saying, computer engineers of the day were not satisfied yet (they never are, trust me) and went on to find other weird and wacky ways to store data, even in the absence of semiconductors.  </p><p>The next thing they came up with is one of my personal favorites, something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube">Williams-Kilburn Tube</a> —  Invented in 1948 by (surprise) Fred Williams and Tom Kilburn.  This device was basically a CRT tube very similar to one you would find in an old television, and bits of data could be projected as dots on an x/y grid of the tube.  Although some tubes were coated inside with phosphor, it was not the light from the dots that held the state of the bits, but rather the secondary electrical charge produced on the screen when the electron gun fired.</p><p>The charge for any particular dot that was written would take a while to decay, and in the intervening time, a detector plate in front of the CRT would read the values of the dots, and write any “ones” that were fading back to full charge strength before the charge was depleted.  If that sounds really hacky / <a href="https://www.rubegoldberg.com/">Rube Goldberg</a>-like, keep in mind that this principle is very similar to modern-day dynamic ram, which stores charge temporarily and also requires a refresh cycle to occur periodically to rewrite values.</p><p>Anyway this memory had all sorts of issues with calibration, wear-out, and other things, but it was arguably the first electronic random-access memory invented, which had huge advantages over older approaches like delay lines.   Williams-Kilburn tubes were successfully used on several commercial computers made by IBM and others in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b5cd732-32a6-4e72-bf8e-b0e56cb9e928_800x1067.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Inside of a Williams-Kilburn Tube Memory Assembly </figcaption></figure></div><h2>Core Capabilities</h2><p>The real game-changer of the pre-semiconductor storage scene though would come in 1951 or so, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory">magnetic core memory</a> was developed by <a href="https://history.computer.org/pioneers/wang.html">An Wang</a> and others.  Core was a technology consisting of a matrix of donut-shaped ferrite beads that could hold state based on the polarity of a magnetic field that was induced into each one, via row and column wires strung through the beads.</p><p>Like the Williams Tube, core memory was randomly-accessible, but faster and generally more reliable, and with a greater information density.  The amount of power needed to operate a core memory was generally flat regardless of the size, unlike its predecessors, and larger, multi-kilobyte systems were feasible with the technology.  But there were a couple of downsides.   </p><p>The first issue was that ferrite beads were expensive to make, and had to be hand strung, one bit at a time. Armies of factory workers, usually women because of their smaller hands and fine motor skills, worked to assemble these systems from the 1950’s, all the way into the mid 1970s when semiconductor RAM systems took over. Computers in general were hand made back then, and also very expensive though - so a little extra expense for core was not too big a deal, given the increased capability afforded by it.</p><p>The second issue with core was, the process used to read the ferrite beads also reversed the magnetic field, effectively erasing the state of the bit.  This is where An Wang comes in though, because he contributed a circuit solution for this problem that introduced a read-then-write cycle for core access, kind of a discrete refresh that only takes place when the memory was read.</p><p>Despite any costs or quirks, core was a commercial hit, and many computers, including the circa 1974 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a> I used to punch that paper tape in the picture above, ran on core (a 32K array, if I remember right).  </p><p>Another interesting property of core was that it is a non-volatile system, unlike most of its predecessors.  The magnetic field in each ferrite bead is quite durable, and unless the core system is exposed to a strong magnetic source, the state of the memory should last almost indefinitely, even with no power.</p><p>That means that all those old computers in storage somewhere, in museums, in landfills or wherever they may be, likely still contain the last program they ever ran.  And If you could find a way to power one on, that code could actually run again.</p><p>Spooky.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c00c6fd-5e5a-4cb3-bfe6-bf5661cff4ea_626x391.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Closeup of a ferrite core memory matrix</figcaption></figure></div><p>After core came MOS and CMOS memory in the form of static and dynamic RAM, EEPROMS, and a few oddball things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_memory">magnetic bubble memory</a> that never caught on.  But for the most part, memory systems of the 1970’s are very similar to the ones we have today.  Smaller, faster, with a host of innovative enhancements, but essentially the same base technologies.</p><p>As mentioned I spent my early hardware engineering days designing memory systems, and I’m just a little sad I didn’t get to work on any of these weird and wonderful beasts that came before my time.  But I’m a little hopeful that a new, weird age of storage may soon be upon us.  </p><p>Things like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/what-is-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> will likely bring back strange ideas to design of storage systems.  I know close to nothing about quantum computing or physics, except that it tends to break traditional rules, like things cannot exist in two states at the same time.  Sounds like a great potential for awesome new storage systems we haven’t even thought of yet.  </p><p>Taking advantage of new technology like this may require coming up with a whole new crop of weird ideas.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solène created a week-long <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-07-07-old-computer-challenge.html">personal computing challenge</a> around old computers. I chose to use an Amiga for the week. In this issue I write about my experience, and what modern computing lost when Commodore died. I also want to show some of the things you can do with an Amiga or even an emulator if you&#39;d like to try.</p><p>If someone sent this to you and you’d like to read more, check out the <a href="https://thedorkweb.substack.com/?no_cover=true">back issues</a>. Get future issues in your inbox by subscribing below or add the site to your RSS reader.   </p><p>As I keep telling my partner, Amigas aren’t an addiction, they’re just a very expensive hobby.</p><p id="youtube2-roASIL7G7XE" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;roASIL7G7XE&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/roASIL7G7XE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>This issue’s music comes from <a href="https://hoffman.home.blog/2019/04/27/eon/">H0ffman</a> and The Black Lotus’ Eon demo. Press play and read on, although you really should watch the demo at some point. It&#39;s amazing how they crammed so much into two floppy disks. It&#39;s even more amazing how this runs on an OCS A500 with 1Mb of RAM. Eon rinses every spare scanline to deliver high art on a machine using chips from the green screen text era. TBL wrote a <a href="http://tbl.nu/posts/">blog post series</a> explaining how it was done.</p><h2>Legends Never Die</h2><p>Friends, acquaintances and random people often ask me, “What is the greatest computer range of all time and why is it the Commodore Amiga?”. Of course I don’t wait for them to ask me. I just shout out reasons why the Amiga is the best from across the street. Some might say Amiga owners are the original computing fan-boys. I think that’d be insulting to Commodore 64 owners. Still, there’s <em>something</em> about the Amiga that resonates with me in ways modern computing doesn’t.</p><p>Although Commodore died in 1994 the Amiga itself became a zombie platform for a while. For the longest time the Amiga was going to come back with a vengeance any day now, until it didn’t. It kind of turned into a joke until one day the joke was forgotten. This is mostly down to long-running, pointless and unhelpful legal disputes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9129455a-b0fd-4d73-ba30-f46aa1256af2_1920x1080.jpeg"></a><figcaption>CoffinOS on WinUAE running a selection of apps while playing an MP3</figcaption></figure></div><p>But every day thousands of people still use Amigas to create, code and play. I’m just one of them. For a dead platform with a dead OS there’s a remarkable amount activity. New hardware, software, games and Operating Systems are coming out all the time.</p><p>Hyperion released AmigaOS 3.2 a couple of months ago. My copy arrived at the same time as Solène’s challenge. AmigaOS 3.2 is the latest version of the official Amiga Operating System, hot on the heels of 2019’s AmigaOS 3.1.4.1. AmigaOS 3.2 is the 3rd major OS release for the Amiga this year after NetBSD 9.2 and Debian Linux.</p><p>Amiga users realised that Cloanto, A-EON and Hyperion’s legal fighting won’t bring the Amiga back. They built their own toys and the Amiga’s future has never been brighter.</p><p>WinUAE, Amiga Forever, Amiberry and Pimiga provide easy ways to use Amiga software. New systems like the FPGA-based MiSTer and the Vampire Standalone provide excellent compatibility. eBay prices can be eyewatering but upgrades are cheaper and better than ever before. The <a href="https://github.com/captain-amygdala/pistorm">Pistorm</a> is an all-in-one accelerator, RAM, storage and graphics card for low-end Amigas. The upcoming <a href="https://www.buffee.ca/">Buffee</a> accelerator promises equivalent 68040 CPU speeds of up to 400Mhz and a Gigabyte of RAM.</p><h2>Trying Amiga OS 3.2</h2><p>In hindsight, installing a new OS from scratch wasn’t the best starting point for Solène’s challenge. I spent more time installing and configuring than using my Amiga 4000. It has a Motorola 68060 CPU running at 55Mhz, 352Gb of storage, full 1080P HD graphics, 16-bit sound, Ethernet and USB 2.0. For the challenge I took the RAM down from 658Mb to 386Mb. Everything I&#39;ve done here would be doable on an Amiga 500 with a Pistorm, or <a href="https://retroready.one/products/tf536-terriblefire-turbo-board-68030-50mhz-64mb-fast-memory">TerribleFire</a> board and a <a href="https://github.com/cnvogelg/plipbox">Plipbox</a>.</p><p>The biggest lie this machine tells you is that it’s a modern computer. It’s nearly 30 years old and I have more powerful kitchen appliances. Most of the time you wouldn’t notice the age. The difference between my 1992 Amiga 4000 and 1982 ZX Spectrum is far greater than between my Amiga 4000 and a modern PC on the same desk.</p><p id="youtube2-0732yqmAXYw" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;0732yqmAXYw&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0732yqmAXYw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>Amigabill runs through 13 new AmigaOS 3.2 features he likes. Most are quality-of-life improvements that already existed with third-party tools in some form. Coming from Amiga OS 3.9, by far the biggest difference is speed. Amiga OS 3.2 flies thanks to it’s 3.1 heritage. Amiga OS 3.9 built on Amiga OS 3.5, and both are bloaty (by Amiga standards). At the time they were stepping stones to a PPC-powered future. Unfortunately that future never fully arrived.</p><p>The install had minor problems but I got there in the end. I installed <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=107410&amp;highlight=bestwb">BestClassicWB</a> as I prefer OS 3.9’s look. I added speech and Fat95 handlers, Eastern to generate icon thumbnails and WarpDT WebP and PSD Datatypes. Datagubbe saved me the trouble of detailing more of <a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/">the little things that made the Amiga great</a>. As Icons, Handlers and Datatypes are some of the greatest things we lost from Amiga OS, I’ll break them down here. </p><h2>Icons and .info</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5332ce48-3913-424d-a344-8c96b341ff04_1280x720.png"></a></figure></div><p>AmigaOS elegantly handles file metadata through .info files. These manage permissions and associations (called default tools). They provide something like localised environment variables called Tool types. Folders, files and even devices can have .info files, as shown in the screenshot above. In Amiga OS 3.2 Default icons are stored in ENVARC:Sys. These provide default settings for files lacking icons.</p><p>Icons are separate to the files they&#39;re associated with. As such the Amiga lacks a native thumbnail concept. 3rd-party tools like <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/wb/eastern">Eastern</a> generate thumbnail icons for files that lack them.</p><h2>Devices, Handlers and Assigns</h2><p>Amiga OS uses a pluggable filesystem model. To add support for a new filesystem, you install a handler and create a mountlist. The handler describes the filesystem to AmigaOS. A mountlist is a text file describing a physical device (e.g. CD0 for a CD) that specifies a handler.</p><p>This lets an expanded 1985-era Amiga 1000 use modern filesystems like FAT32 and NTFS. For example, I read DVDs using AllegroCDFS. DVDs only came into existence two years after Commodore’s bankruptcy.</p><p>Amiga devices have both physical and logical names. The physical name usually refers to a device e.g. DF0: for the first physical drive, DF1: for second etc. Disk content would neither know nor care which drive it was in, so a logical volume name (e.g. NComm:) is used.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F267f606c-f714-4470-9c6f-868b360a92a7_1280x720.png"></a><figcaption>Logical Volumes, directories and device assignments on my A4000</figcaption></figure></div><p>Logical volume names can be <em>assigned</em> to folders. Multiple folders can be assigned to the same logical volume such as LIBS: in the screenshot above. This functions like a path. The NComm tool doesn’t care where it lives, it just looks for NComm: and finds what it needs.</p><p>Two devices not commonly used in many modern systems are RAM: and RAD:. Imagine a mega-fast temporary disk drive that doubles whenever you kill Slack. That’s RAM: which is great for working with file archives. RAD: is a fixed-size bootable RAM disk that survives soft reboots. Equivalents exist for most modern Operating Systems. They’re worth trying out. You don’t really know how useful they are till you lose them. </p><h2>Datatypes</h2><p>Some of the best Amiga software came out over 30 years ago, long before modern file formats came out. While the Amiga introduced many standards, the native formats aren’t as common today. Datatypes bring modern formats to old Amigas.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb422e3d2-2408-41c5-9552-4107f2451d95_1280x720.png"></a><figcaption>Multiview accessing (clockwise from top left) a text (m3u) file, a jpeg picture, an AmigaGuide cheat collection, a GIF while playing w96.aif, an AIFF audio file. Like OSX Preview but from 1992.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Like filesystem handlers, Datatypes describe a file format and tell the OS how to handle it. Any datatype-aware program can use any file format as long as a relevant datatype is present. Commodore introduced Multiview in Workbench 3.0. This is a bit like Mac OS Preview, but from 1992.</p><p>AmigaOS 3.2 comes with datatypes for modern formats like Jpeg and PNG files. Oliver Roberts’ <a href="https://www.warpdt.co.uk/">WarpDT datatypes</a> provide support for Photoshop PSD files and Google’s WebP. Datatypes exist for Microsoft Word, Canon CR2 Raw Photos, as well as more obscure formats like the C64 Koala screen format.</p><h2>AmigaGuide</h2><p>Commodore introduced the AmigaGuide hypertext format to provide developer documentation access. Unlike HTML, AmigaGuide is lightweight and designed for offline use. Images aren’t embedded in-line but can be linked to from within a document. Aminet AmigaGuides cover everything from Star Trek episodes to <a href="http://m68k.aminet.net/package/docs/hyper/potato">The Ultimate German Potato guide</a>.</p><h2>Using My Amiga For Personal Computing</h2><p>During the week I used my Amiga for various things, but I don’t do personal computing every day. Amigas can do email but it’s not worth setting up just for a week. I normally write in Protext and WordWorth but spent most of the week getting to know Amiga OS 3.2’s TextEdit.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9e1907-d7d0-4c16-9e45-564389a9fcb0_1280x720.png"></a></figure></div><p>Web browsing on the Amiga is possible, but modern sites aren’t fun to use. <a href="https://www.ibrowse-dev.net/">IBrowse</a> 2.5 last updated this April supports modern HTTPS and even some Javascript. NetSurf, while slow supports CSS and modern JS.</p><p>There are also things I did on Amiga OS 3.9 that I haven’t got round to setting up yet. For example, I normally use Stunnel, ZNC and Bitlbee to access Telegram, Slack and Mastodon. I use Newscoaster to catch up on public and private Usenet servers. I enjoy playing with Vista and Lightwave. I fix up photos with ImageFX, Photogenics and Art Effect. I even made an anim version of the <a href="https://thedorkweb.substack.com/p/a-demoscene-conversion">Bad Apple</a> Touhou video solely using the Amiga.</p><p>I spent the week off Secure Scuttle Butt as I use a Windows-based client. I didn’t have time beforehand to set up anything more portable. In the week I modelled COVID stats with Turbo Calc, listened to mods with EaglePlayer and BBC Radio 6 Music with Amiga AMP.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F548ac007-1e95-482f-91d4-83f692e79cc5_1920x1080.jpeg"></a><figcaption>Earlier version of my COVID tracking sheet</figcaption></figure></div><p>I use a Creative BT-W2 USB-Bluetooth soundcard with a bluetooth speaker on my Thinkpad. It works well as a replacement for the Thinkpad&#39;s terrible speakers. </p><p>I’ve toyed with ST Micro’s discovery boards to build retargetable sound support for the ZX20. I plugged an STM32F407 board running some USB soundcard code into the Amiga and it worked first time. I want to make the STM32 available to the ZX20 as a kind of media player/DSP/co-processor. If it works on the ZX20 it’ll probably work on the Amiga too.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F080f24fe-9a59-44db-9787-9eacf0f50346_640x256.png"></a><figcaption>Logging into the Particles BBS over NComm via the Internet with telser.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I use the Roadshow TCP/IP stack to access my network and the Internet. Lots of older Amiga software uses the serial.device for serial links. <a href="http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/telser140">Telser</a> creates a fake serial device that works over IP. I can point it at any network destination and connect to BBSes with old-school clients. It also opened up the possibility to do something way cooler.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c1f6c1d-3782-44bc-981e-180885ac8244_640x512.png"></a><figcaption>AmiCom on an Amiga 4000 monitoring APRS radio broadcasts</figcaption></figure></div><p>I spent most of Saturday trying to get CAT control working with a Yaesu FT-897d radio. While I did eventually succeed, background RF noise made it impossible to decode 2m APRS broadcasts. I fell back to <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a>s on a Windows 10 PC and routed the audio to a <a href="https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf">Direwolf</a> audio modem via a <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Cable/">Virtual Cable</a>. I configured AmiCom to use Direwolf as a KISS TNC over the network via telser and dialed in. The screenshot above shows decodes of APRS traffic around Cheshire, North England.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa240b84d-b6c6-465d-b461-918466babc6f_320x256.png"></a></figure></div><p>I also tried sending SSTV on 2M from the Amiga via af_mksstv, but I only had a phone to hand for the decode. I doubt anyone picked it up given RF noise levels. If you did, I’d love to see your decode!</p><p>Although possible, most modern activities are quicker on modern computers. The Amiga is capable of a lot and there is software for almost everything. Amiga software holds your hands less, and often involves more steps. Some activities involve waiting times that just don’t exist on modern systems. On the plus side, Amiga software rarely features telemetry. Spying on users takes up cycles, and they&#39;d notice.</p><p>Of course I played games on the Amiga. Yes, I can play doom full-screen at full-speed but I can do that on a PC. I prefer being insulted by Archer Maclean’s Pool, doing mad jumps in Stunt Car Racer and blowing up Worms. It’s not all old games either.</p><p id="youtube2-y9fQw1W22i8" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;y9fQw1W22i8&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:&#34;1503s&#34;,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y9fQw1W22i8?start=1503s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>This year has seen AGA remakes of Turrican 2, Supercars 2, and the recently released Turbo Sprint. Amiga 500 owners aren’t left behind. There is a new Robocop arcade port in the works and original games like Wrong Way Driver and Super Delivery Boy. Dread is an upcoming unaccelerated Amiga 500 Doom remake. That’s right, full speed on an unaccelerated Amiga 500. You can watch it in action on the video above from 25 minutes in.</p><p>Yes I can listen to Internet Radio on a Bluetooth speaker from my Amiga. Yes that does feel cool in a nerdy way, but it’s not a reason to have one. Nostalgia has a strong pull but Amiga OS 3.2 isn&#39;t nostalgic, it’s new. The main reason to use an Amiga in 2021 is the same as it was in 1985 - Creativity.</p><p>The iPad was the first successful consumption-oriented mass-market computing device. Yes you can create on an iPad now, but as it was initially designed for consumption, not creation. The success of the iPad led to consumption-oriented design patterns being added to modern systems.</p><p>From the beginning the Amiga was designed for creativity. It permeates through the Operating System. There are applications for everything. 36 Years after it arrived, the Amiga still excels at pixel art, music and 3D graphics. The lack of always-connected design reduces distraction. The multi-tasking OS keeps things usable. </p><p>Personal computing on an Amiga is intentional, not passive. There is no doomscrolling. No pop-up distractions. No recommended content from carefully selected partners. You turn on, do what interests you, then switch it off. I have a similar experience with Mac System 7. Of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jph0gxzL3UI">the fastest 68k Mac</a> is an Amiga.</p><h2>Things You May Have Missed, Amiga Edition</h2><p id="youtube2-TqLSQ07G7qM" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;TqLSQ07G7qM&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TqLSQ07G7qM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p><p>In this video <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/">Amigalove</a>’s Intric8 walks through his amazing Tron art piece made in Deluxe Paint III, step-by-step.

      <title>The insides of pro bowling balls will make your head spin</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_popsci_com_story_technology_bowling-ball-insides-photos_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p id="KUKEAEKQ3ZHUBNPVK53W7MEQB4">No matter how hard you try to spin the house balls at your local bowling joint, they rarely curve. That’s because they are simple spheres built for durability, not fancy moves. But a small handful of companies—among them <a href="https://www.stormbowling.com/" target="_blank">Storm Bowling</a>—create gear that is surprisingly complex inside. Precisely shaped, meticulously balanced weight blocks leverage the laws of physics to help skilled alley jockeys throw a strike on most rolls. This clever engineering allows the projectiles to hook inward as they approach the end of the 60-foot lane, where the invisible oil slick on the boards thins. The spin an expert gives the globe (as fast as 600 rpm) will find purchase there as the friction increases, putting the orb right next to the headpin. Here’s a look at what’s going on under the surface.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Captain Hook <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="35E3QIGUUJAMXBMNCYEUR5SDTU">The crimson disk—called a weight block—in this roller is taller than it is deep, and heavier on its bottom thanks to that silver circle, known as the slug. Those design decisions create uneven rotational forces, causing this model, the Code Red, to sharply swing from the edge toward the center for a strike.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Smooth Operator <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="7WO4DIQGARAKZLFT2RUL2ZAICQ">Despite the weird shape, the mass in the Phaze III’s green core is evenly distributed, so the sphere travels in a gentle curve through its impact with the pins. Pros call this a “benchmark ball” because they can use its movements to read the oil pattern on a lane during practice and then adjust their form—or equipment choice—for the competition.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Holey Roller <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="3SNZAYYVD5F27L5OBPPP4AXZ5U">Drilling finger holes typically removes 3 or 4 ounces of material. That can include chunks of the dense weight within, changing how the globe rolls. Divots (seen at the top here) in the Alpha Crux’s blue core leave room for digits without majorly changing the ball’s behavior.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Traction Star <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="ZHGLECIO5RGOTMN56NSVGEHHRA">The rotational forces generated by the asymmetrical chunky green block inside the Intense wouldn’t be able to influence the orb’s trajectory as well if the cover couldn’t firmly grip the lane. Crushed mica mixed into the surface of this ball increases friction once it hits dry boards near the pins, creating a hook even for those who throw with less spin.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Pin Puncher <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="L3ZWLMQN6VC3LJALGLG244UM4U">The red bulges on the Optimus’ symmetrical core let bowlers tweak its performance. If they bore their finger holes into the blob’s bumps, rolls will more aggressively hook; if they avoid them, the mass still ensures a nice curve. The model’s heavier versions—up to 16 pounds—will crash through pins with more force, making them more likely to knock out others.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Spin Doctor <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="GK7KYNYDWFAZRK3X6XOPPZH574">With high density and a low center of gravity, the Son!Q’s weight block helps bowlers who roll with fewer revolutions per minute add more curve potential to their shots. And just for fun, Storm infuses some balls with a scent: This one smells like yummy gingerbread s’mores.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Tight Twirler <i>Travis Rathbone</i></figcaption></figure>

<p id="SQXAGNRSBZCUDK5POWGRUT7MQY">The Sure Lock’s bright orange, X-shaped mass is composed of heavy iron oxide. That concentrates heft at the center, allowing this sphere to spin quickly just after a bowler releases it—similar to the way figure skaters begin whirling faster when they tuck in their arms. The extra rotations help swing the globe back to center in slippery, oil-heavy lanes.</p>
