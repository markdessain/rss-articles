      <title>Launch HN: BlackOakTV (YC S21) – Netflix for black people</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28087309</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN! We are Uzo and Iyanu, the founders of BlackOakTV (<a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv</a>). BlackOakTV is a subscription video platform serving black audiences by making it easy for them to watch TV shows and movies that feature black stories and characters.<p>Nearly three-quarters of Black people want to watch more content that portrays their lives and experiences (Target Market News, 2018), but they can&#39;t find enough of it, and when they do find it, it usually hasn&#39;t gotten the budget or development resources that more mainstream content does.</p><p>When I grew up in the 90s, it seemed like black people had a relatively high number of TV shows to choose from like &#34;Martin&#34;, &#34;Living Single,&#34; and &#34;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&#34;. It felt good. I felt represented. Unfortunately, it turns out the 90s were an aberration, and over the next 2 decades, black content would become widely underrepresented in Hollywood. Having watched too much TV as a kid, I foolishly decided to get into media as an adult. I worked as a journalist, producer, media strategist and executive, loving to make content, but always being reminded that my culture wasn’t getting the representation it deserved, and always hoping to do something about that someday.</p><p>When I started at YouTube and Google, I thought I would finally be able to help change that; I thought the internet and the world&#39;s biggest video source would bring black people the same awesome experience they were creating for other viewers and creators. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. Black millennial users of YouTube, despite using it more than any other millennial group, often expressed that the comments on YouTube could make it an uncomfortable place. And black creators often did not get the same chance at success that their mainstream counterparts did, leading to some black creators filing lawsuits against YouTube. Despite YouTube&#39;s good intentions, systemic biases in how non-black users treated black creators, as well as the economic realities of Black people only representing 10% of the U.S. audience, have led to YouTube never doing quite enough to address this.</p><p>So I left YouTube, and Iyanu and I decided to address this on our own. The creator economy is booming, with black influencers among the most creative, and black consumers often among the most energetic and prolific users. I knew that energy could be harvested into a platform that gave black viewers the content they want, and creators the chance to make it. So we started BlackOakTV with the goal of delivering the most, and the best, Black content possible.</p><p>We license content from indie creators and make it available in one place, so Black viewers have a one-stop shop for the content they want to see. We&#39;re also creating/commissioning original content, to raise the bar on quality. We&#39;re different from Netflix in that our focus on black content means we can identify new black voices earlier, make it easier to find black content on our platform (hint: it’s everywhere!), and better serve the diversity of black viewers rather than just treating Black people as one single niche. As for the other streaming services targeting black users, our main differentiator from them will eventually be our product. Iyanu is an amazing engineer, and with his prowess, our product will provide a unique viewing experience, full of the features black viewers want.</p><p>But Netflix’s business model is where we aim to be a lot like them. Because Netflix changed media not just because of how they made their content available, but because for the first time in TV history, the aggregator of the content owned a direct relationship with the end user--and that’s why streaming is so valuable. And it’s why we want to have a product that makes users want to view our content exclusively through our properties. Today, users can go to blackoak.tv or download one of our apps, and after subscribing to our 7-day free trial, they can watch all of our content, on-demand, simply by scrolling through our catalog of shows and films. And because we appreciate the HN community taking time to hear our story, for a short period of time, we’re making some of our original black TV shows available for free on our site and in our apps on iOS, Android, Roku and Amazon Firestick. You don’t even have to sign up, just find the &#34;free section&#34; on our homepage or click the following link: <a href="https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes" rel="nofollow">https://beta.blackoak.tv/categories/free-episodes</a>.</p><p>With that, I welcome any feedback, ideas, or experiences similar to ours. It’s been very challenging trying to enter a quickly maturing business with a lot of competition from public companies, and while we think we have some of the answers, your suggestions, thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated!</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <section>
      <p>~4.5 years ago I bought Dell XPS 15. It was a powerhorse without a match for that size/price.</p>
<p>I must admit that I wasn&#39;t happy about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcam is positioned below the screen, recording my typing fingers instead of my face.</li>
<li>Battery getting swollen (and being forced to fly that way wasn&#39;t fun), after replacing it happened again.</li>
<li>The CPU fan is loud and throttles a lot.</li>
<li>There&#39;s only one company in Slovenia that does warranty repairs and takes the law-specified 40 working days to finish their job (replacing a battery, for example).</li>
<li>Too heavy (over 2kg)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to go back to Thinkpads, as they are unmatched by the overall experience and quality to run Linux.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://bgamari.github.io/posts/2020-08-22-what-i-want-in-a-laptop.html">Ben Gamari&#39;s post</a>, I&#39;ve figured out I have the following requirements for the new laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bright screen (400 nits or possibly more), so I can work outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high-resolution screen (UHD), so that I can reasonably split the screen vertically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14&#34; or 15&#34; screen, I&#39;ve still not made up my mind but both of these work well for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light-weight (less than 2kg) so that I can travel light (and hold the laptop with one hand if I have to move a few meters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32 GB of RAM, so that I don&#39;t have to worry about hitting the limit (I don&#39;t even configure swap these days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrete GPU, to make it less convenient to play video games and there&#39;s less power drain from the battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiet fans, I haven&#39;t bothered with this before. XPS was really loud and I&#39;m getting older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best CPU possible, as I&#39;m <a href="https://cachix.org">frequently compiling Haskell</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good battery life (ideally 8h or more), so that I can do my day of work without worrying about a plug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast repair turnaround, I get that with Lenovo in Slovenia with about a day (if they have spare parts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 2 years of warranty, possibly 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thinkpad-p14s">Thinkpad P14s</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve bought a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/coming-soon/P14s-AMD-G2/p/22WSP144SA2">Thinkpad P14s</a>:</p>

<p>CPU benchmarks claim I&#39;m going from <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7700HQ+%40+2.80GHz&amp;id=2906">6945</a> to 
<a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+PRO+5850U&amp;id=4198">19504</a> CPU marks (for comparison, Apple M1 has 15139). Quite impressive!</p>
<p>After a few days of using it, it&#39;s noticeable faster.</p>
<p>Even with the fan at 4500 RPM, it&#39;s completely quiet.</p>
<p>Overall it meets all my requirements except for the battery (while I haven&#39;t tested it, I expect it to last below 8h).</p>
<p>Having a German keyboard is a price I pay for the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_global_chip_shortage">chip shortage</a>,
as it&#39;s hard to get a hold of P14s model with US/UK keyboard (also Brexit). Is there some kind of keys replacements service?</p>
<h3 id="nixos-setup">NixOS Setup</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/42127">NixOS doesn&#39;t yet support Secure Boot</a>, the first thing you need to do is boot into BIOS and disable it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/building-bootable-iso-image">Building bootable ISO image tutorial</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/lenovo/thinkpad/p14s/amd/gen2/default.nix">nixos-hardware support for Thinkad P14s</a> to be able to boot with an ISO
image that has wifi card support.</p>
<p>Installation of NixOS is almost identical to official instructions with <a href="https://gist.github.com/domenkozar/c1da433406807255f9aa835d72976470">a twist of encrypted root partition</a>.</p>
<p>Wifi works (<a href="https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89/issues/30">although there are issues with speed</a>), Bluetooth works, brightness control works, webcam works, trackpad works, suspend works.</p>
<p>Happy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wavefront rendering, see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2013-07_Megakernels-Considered-Harmful/laine2013hpg_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Laine et al. 2013</a></li>
<li>Multiple BVH types
<ul>
<li>Standard binary <em>SAH-based BVH</em></li>
<li><em>SBVH</em> (Spatial BVH), see <a href="https://www.nvidia.in/docs/IO/77714/sbvh.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stich et al. 2009</a>. This BVH is able to split across triangles.</li>
<li><em>QBVH</em> (Quaternary BVH). The QBVH is a four-way BVH that is constructed by iteratively collapsing the Nodes of a binary BVH. The collapsing procedure was implemented as described in <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/multi_rt08.pdf" rel="nofollow">Wald et al. 2008</a>.</li>
<li><em>CWBVH</em> (Compressed Wide BVH), see <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/ylitie2017hpg-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ylitie et al. 2017</a>. Eight-way BVH that is constructed by collapsing a binary BVH. Each BVH Node is compressed so that it takes up only 80 bytes per node. The implementation incudes the Dynamic Fetch Heurisic as well as Triangle Postponing (see paper). The CWBVH outperforms all other BVH types.</li>
<li>BVH Optimization. The SAH cost of binary BVH&#39;s can be optimized using a method by <a href="https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/15603/2013-Fast-Insertion-Based-Optimization-of-Bounding-Volume-Hierarchies.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bittner et al. 2012</a>.</li>
<li>All BVH types use Dynamic Ray Fetching to reduce divergence among threads, see <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/76976/HPG2009-Trace-Efficiency.pdf" rel="nofollow">Aila et al. 2009</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two Level Acceleration Structures
<ul>
<li>BVH&#39;s are split into two parts, at the world level (TLAS) and at the model level (BLAS). This allows dynamic scenes with moving Meshes as well as Mesh instancing where multiple meshes with different transforms share the same underlying triangle/BVH data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>SVGF</em> (Spatio-Temporal Variance Guided Filter), see <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/publications/2017/svgf/svgf_preprint.pdf" rel="nofollow">Schied et al</a>. Denoising filter that allows for noise-free images at interactive framerates. Also includes a TAA pass.</li>
<li>Importance Sampling
<ul>
<li><em>Next Event Estimation</em> (NEE): Shadow rays are explicitly aimed at light sources to reduce variance.</li>
<li><em>Multiple Importance Sampling</em> (MIS): Explicit light sampling (NEE) is combined with standard BRDF sampling using MIS to get the best of both.</li>
<li>Cosine weighted direction sampling for diffuse bounces.</li>
<li>Microfacet sampling as described in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf" rel="nofollow">Walter et al. 2007</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Mipmapping</em>: Textures are sampled using mipmapping. Mipmap sampling is done using ray cones (see <a href="http://www.jcgt.org/published/0010/01/01/" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2012</a>, <a href="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/ea/seed/presentations/2019-ray-tracing-gems-chapter-20-akenine-moller-et-al.pdf" rel="nofollow">Möller et al. 2019</a>). Primary rays perform anisotropic sampling, subsequent bounces use isotropic sampling.</li>
<li><em>Blue Noise Sampling</em>: The low discrepency sampler by <a href="https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/762-2/" rel="nofollow">Heitz et al. 2019</a> is used. This sampler distributes Monte Carlo errors as a blue noise in screen space.</li>
<li>Hot Reloading: When F5 is pressed the CUDA module is destroyed, recompiled, and reloaded.</li>
<li>Multiple Material types
<ul>
<li><em>Diffuse</em></li>
<li><em>Dielectrics</em></li>
<li><em>Microfacets</em> (GGX)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitsuba XML Scene support: A custom Mitsuba XML parser is included to load scene files.</li>

      <title>Tools to Run Kubernetes Locally</title>
      <link>https://yankee.dev/6-tools-to-run-kubernetes-locally</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><p></p><p></p></div><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628148249210/-JvsBHAz6.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp"/><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss<!-- --> <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Kubernetes is a big and complicated technology and it clearly requires some time and dedication to wrap your head around. There is no vendor lock-in meaning it runs the same no matter which managed cloud platform you use it on. This means using it locally will be no different from using it on the cloud.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools for running Kubernetes on your local machine, but it basically boils down to two approaches on how it is done: </p>
<ol>
<li>running it from a single binary package </li>
<li>running it as a container using Docker in Docker (DinD)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="kubernetes-marketplace">Kubernetes Marketplace</h3>

<p>Before we move on to talk about all the tools, it will be beneficial if you installed <code>arkade</code> on your machine. It will help you get these tools with a single command. </p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="features">Features?</h2>
<p>All of the tools listed here more or less offer the same feature, including but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Multi-Node cluster</li>
<li>Persistent volumes </li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Certificates</li>
<li>Bare-metal support</li>
<li>Dashboard </li>
<li>Kubernetes Versions</li>
<li>Add-ons</li>
<li>Cross-platform</li>
<li>Tracks upstream Kubernetes</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="single-package-binary">Single package binary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s">k3s</a> </strong>
</p>
<p>k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution from Rancher Labs. It is specifically targeted for running on IoT and Edge devices, meaning it is a perfect candidate for your Raspberry Pi or a virtual machine. </p>
<p>It comes with a single binary of mere &lt;40 MB and takes as low as 500 MB of RAM.  </p>
<p>You can bootstrap k3s quickly using  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup">k3sup</a> !</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3sup
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s">k0s</a> </strong>

k0s is the latest entry on the block. By name, you might think it&#39;s a more stripped version of k3s, but it&#39;s an entirely different distribution from an entirely different company, called Mirantis. Contrary to the name, it comes in a larger binary of 150 MB+.</p>
<p>It can be run as a binary or in DinD mode. k0s takes security seriously and out of the box, it meets the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/security/definitions/what-does-mean-fips-compliant/">FIPS compliance</a>.  Although, a new distribution, k0s has reached the production-ready status, so there wouldn&#39;t be an issue for development usage. </p>
<pre><code>arkade get k0s
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s">Microk8s</a> </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  MicroK8s is a Kubernetes distribution by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. You already saw this coming; it can only be installed using <code>snap</code>.  It comes with loads of add-ons baked in like Fluentd, Grafana and Prometheus. </p>
<p>If you are on Ubuntu or its derivatives that uses <code>snap</code> you&#39;ll feel right at home using MicroK8s.</p>
<pre><code>  sudo snap install microk8s --classic
</code></pre>
<h2 id="docker-in-docker-dind">Docker in Docker (DinD)</h2>
<p>Running Docker inside of Docker (Inception anyone?) is a popular way of bootstrapping Kubernetes. The isolating nature of Docker makes running a multi-node cluster a breeze on a single machine, and also ensures the running instance does not affect the machine itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the title suggests, you need to have Docker installed on your machine to go this route.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">minikube</a> </strong>

Despite running on top of Docker and similar container technologies, minikube is really flexible in how it operates and supports multiple virtualization drivers making it adaptable to different computing environments.  These include KVM2, Virtualbox, Podman, Hyperkit, Hyper-V and many more.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get minikube
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind">KinD</a></strong>

Kubernetes in Docker (KinD) is similar to minikube but it does not spawn VM&#39;s to run clusters and works only with Docker.  KinD for the most part has the least bells and whistles and offers an intuitive developer experience in getting started with Kubernetes in no time.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get kind
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d/">k3d</a> </strong>

k3d is basically running k3s inside of Docker. It provides an instant benefit over using k3s on a local machine, that is, multi-node clusters. Running inside Docker, we can easily spawn multiple instances of our k3s Nodes.</p>
<pre><code>arkade get k3d
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Either you choose a single binary package or DinD approach, Kubernetes has made itself pretty accessible. For new learners, the barrier to entry is low, and the feedback loop is instantaneous. </p>
<p>I hope this article has been helpful in deciding which tool to use for running your local Kubernetes instance.</p>

      <title>Reflections on 10k Hours of Programming</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours — Malcolm Gladwell in Outsiders</blockquote><p>Well, I&#39;m certainly not a world-class expert, but I have put my 10,000 hours of deliberate practice into programming. Here are 31 of my reflections on programming.</p><p>These are reflections only about <strong>pure coding</strong> — no lessons sum up to &#34;programming is about people&#34; or &#34;how to be a senior technical leader&#34; (arguably more important to a career, but not the topic of this post).<em> </em></p><p><em>These reflections are just about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours</em>. Most don&#39;t apply to beginners. These reflections are not career advice. Think of them as lessons on being a technical guitarist, not about being a good band member. They are about becoming a better programmer for yourself.</p><ol><li>Browsing the source is almost always faster than finding an answer on StackOverflow.</li><li>In many cases, what you&#39;re working on doesn&#39;t have an answer on the internet. That usually means the problem is hard or important, or both.</li><li>Delete as much code as you can.</li><li>Syntactic sugar is usually bad.</li><li>Simple is hard.</li><li>Have a wide variety of tools and know which ones to use for the job.</li><li>Know the internals of the most used ones like git and bash (I can get out of the most gnarly git rebase or merge).</li><li>Build your own tools for repeated workflows. There is nothing faster than using a tool you made yourself (see: <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/about/">software</a> I wrote).</li><li>Only learn from the best. So when I was learning Go, I read the standard library.</li><li>If it looks ugly, it is most likely a terrible mistake.</li><li>If you have to write a comment that isn&#39;t a docstring, it should probably be refactored. Every new line of comments increases this probability. </li><li>If you don&#39;t understand how your program runs in production, you don&#39;t understand the program itself. In my experience, the best engineers know how their program works in every environment.</li><li>The above rule applies to the build pipeline as well.</li><li>Use other people&#39;s code religiously.</li><li>Corollary: Most code out there is terrible. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to write a better version yourself.</li><li>A rough rule of thumb: never take a direct dependency on a small library that you could easily rewrite or a large library that should have been small.</li><li>Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.</li><li>Organizing your code into modules, packages, and functions is important. Knowing where API boundaries will materialize is an art.</li><li>Pick the most efficient tool most of the time, but also pick what you know. Is Arch Linux the most efficient operating system for the modern developer? For me, it is, but for most, probably not. Should you use acme? Only if you&#39;re Rob Pike.</li><li>Avoid cyclomatic complexity. Novice coders don&#39;t even know that they&#39;ve tangled the dependency graph until it&#39;s too late.</li><li>Avoid nesting conditionals deeply. Have common sense about your conditional tests and naming convention.</li><li>Name variables correctly. Again, an art.</li><li>While rare, sometimes it&#39;s a problem with the compiler. Otherwise, it&#39;s always DNS.</li><li>Use esoteric language features sparingly, but use them when you&#39;re supposed to, for that is the point.</li><li>Technology does not diffuse equally. For example, there is a lot that frontend developers could learn from low-level engineers (especially now that everything is compiled). Likewise, there are UX and usability features that JavaScript developers could teach cloud engineers.</li><li>As a result, different kinds of engineers look at the world differently.</li><li>Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others. I know because I&#39;ve been both a 10x programmer and a -1x programmer.</li><li>There&#39;s no correlation between being a 10x programmer and a 10x employee (maybe a negative one).</li><li>Good APIs are easy to use and hard to misuse.</li><li>The configuration cycle goes from hardcoded values to environment variables, to CLI flags, to a configuration file, to a templated configuration file, to a DSL, to a generic bash script, and back to hardcoded values. Know where you are on this <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/heptagon-of-configuration/">Heptagon of Configuration</a>.</li><li>All layers of abstraction are malleable. If you run into a fundamental wall, sometimes the answer is to go down a layer of abstraction. You aren&#39;t confined to the surface.</li></ol><p><strong>Where did I put in my 10,000 hours?</strong> Well, I&#39;ve been programming for about 15 years. Most recently, I worked as a professional software engineer at Google on Kubernetes and Blackstone, the private equity firm. Before that, I spent most of college in the library writing programs for my own projects instead of writing proofs (which I should have been doing as a math major). And before that, I was hacking away at all sorts of things — <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/runescape-machine-learning/">running a botnet on RuneScape</a>, writing a Latin translation app for the iPhone (so I could do better on my Latin exams), <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/virgo-lang/">writing my own configuration language</a>, creating a web clipper, or <a href="https://eirenicon.org/2020/01/29/ricing-desktops/">ricing up my desktop</a>.</p><p><strong>What did I do for the 10,000 hours?</strong> The most recent work was in distributed systems, but I&#39;ve written code across the stack. Languages like PHP, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Swift. Frontend, backend, mobile, kernel, cloud, ops, and even some IT. I&#39;ve worked on large-scale open-source projects like Kubernetes and maintained subprojects, which allowed me to have my code peer-reviewed by some of the best engineers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Launch HN: Arengu (YC S21) – Frictionless Signup Flows</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28086676</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN, we&#39;re Jacobo, Sergio &amp; Pablo, founders of Arengu (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>). We let you build cutting-edge signup flows as Airbnb, Stripe, or Slack for your SaaS, without dedicating a full engineering team.<p>Building an application requires coding boring flows like signup, logins, payments, and waiting lists. As applications grow, more complex flows are required, and most of the time they can only be edited by engineering teams. If something breaks, sometimes it takes time to notice. Measuring where users drop off can be tricky. Growth and marketing teams want autonomy to sign up users in landing pages, test new flows and get insights into what performs better.</p><p>At our previous jobs, we were constantly asked by clients to customize the signup, adding logic or integrations. We didn&#39;t find a good solution to cover the UI and custom logic with APIs other than coding from scratch. So we built a low-code platform, suitable for non-engineering teams, where you can build all the UI and integrations with a visual interface. Then you embed the flow in your site where you want it to appear with just a line of code.</p><p>Key features include: email or phone verification with OTPs; Stripe integration to enroll users in trial subscriptions; rate limiting to avoid spam or brute force attacks; approvals to build a waiting list and manually approve or reject signups; analytics events to track any user interaction with your flows; native integrations to send data back and forth between us and your apps; custom HTML/JS to extend your flows’ capabilities.</p><p>We make money based on the volume of submissions you have per month or based on product capabilities (eg. adding payment flows in your signup).</p><p>Watch our product intro video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo</a>) or if you scroll down our homepage (<a href="https://www.arengu.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com</a>) to “Try a sign-up flow demo” you can see what the product looks like to the end-user and play around - it’s not to sign up to Arengu :P. There are more demos for every of the common use cases we have (<a href="https://www.arengu.com/use-cases" rel="nofollow">https://www.arengu.com/use-cases</a>).</p><p>We would love to get feedback about your experience building signups flows: painful parts (eg. UI, logic, security, etc), complex flows (eg. KYC, OTPs, data verification, etc); anything you would like to share with us, or if you think we can help you, feel free to reach out at jacobo [at] arengu.com :)</p></td></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</p>
<p><a href="https://trogon.app/" rel="nofollow">https://trogon.app/</a> is a tool for learning to identify birds. You select a
location or region anywhere in the world on the map, and are taken to an
identification challenge (audio or visual) featuring bird species
occurring there.</p>
<p>By default the challenge is audio-only, but this can be changed in the
settings (<i></i> at the top of the page), along with
English vs scientific name preferences, etc.</p>

  </p><ol>
    <li>Zoom in on some area of the world.</li>
    <li>
      Right click / long press (phone) to load nearby

   <p>A couple of weeks ago, Edgar Dworsky walked into a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store in Somerville, Mass., like a detective entering a murder scene. </p>   <p>He stepped into the cereal aisle, where he hoped to find the smoking gun. He scanned the shelves. Oh no, he thought. He was too late. The store had already replaced old General Mills cereal boxes — such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs — with newer ones. It was as though the suspect&#39;s fingerprints had been wiped clean.</p>   <p>Then Dworsky headed toward the back of the store. Sure enough, old boxes of Cocoa Puffs and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios were stacked at the end of one of the aisles. He grabbed an old box of Cocoa Puffs and put it side by side with the new one. Aha! The tip he had received was right on the money. General Mills had downsized the contents of its &#34;family size&#34; boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces. </p>   <p>Dworsky went to the checkout aisle, and both boxes — gasp! — were the same price. It was an open-and-shut case: General Mills is yet another perpetrator of &#34;shrinkflation.&#34;</p>      <div id="res1012410291">

   <h3>Downsizing and shrinkflation mean the same thing</h3>   <p>Dworsky is a former Massachusetts assistant attorney general and longtime consumer advocate. He has spent decades tracking instances of companies shrinking products on his website <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432979f03f664d49dcc5e5c79f39a18dd28b4271efc31369b940439b84ef03106dbcaf749cb0c4b65cddf8ad9f5779632f">Mouseprint</a>. He refers to it by its original name, downsizing, but economist Pippa Malmgren rechristened it &#34;shrinkflation&#34; about a decade ago, and the term stuck. Downsizing and shrinkflation both refer to the same thing: companies reducing the size or quantity of their products while charging the same price or even more.</p>   <p>&#34;Downsizing is really a sneaky price increase,&#34; Dworsky says. &#34;Consumers tend to be price conscious. But they&#39;re not net-weight conscious. They can tell instantly if they&#39;re used to paying $2.99 for a carton of orange juice and that goes up to $3.19. But if the orange juice container goes from 64 ounces to 59 ounces, they&#39;re probably not going to notice.&#34;</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor&#39;s note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>&#39;s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>   <p>If consumers were the rational creatures depicted in classic economic theory, they would notice shrinkflation. They would keep their eyes on the price per Cocoa Puff and not fall for gimmicks in how companies package those Cocoa Puffs. A <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431bda99a81a3e11ccaa9d0a3100c38f5fce925be8af2571a53314c2a5241140d144dd2a80d4a3d73f92a9c5ce53a3b7a8">study</a> by John T. Gourville and Jonathan J. Koehler analyzed data from the market for cereal and other sectors and found that consumers are much more gullible than classic theory predicts. They are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity. Companies, of course, have known this for years.</p>      <h3>The case of the shrinking toilet paper roll</h3>   <p>Back in the day, Dworsky says, he remembers buying bigger candy bars and bigger rolls of toilet paper. The original Charmin roll of toilet paper, he says, had <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074380bdb227e78c01698090ddf0cd7729dde6a63e0f63ec19f02c2726185ba8f8ef8871b7fe92c8264edb806abb7712740b">650 sheets</a>. Now you have to pay extra for &#34;Mega Rolls&#34; and &#34;Super Mega Rolls&#34; — and even those have many fewer sheets than the original. To add insult to injury, Charmin recently <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507436430d5921dd0eb3903b2624508e06d573d78c79c31a38a42d205f2db8be79b17c97dce8733c2adb9a32af3dadb13b309">shrank the size</a> of their toilet sheets. Talk about a crappy deal.</p>   <p>Shrinkflation, or downsizing, is probably as old as mass consumerism. Over the years, Dworsky has documented the downsizing of everything from Doritos to baby shampoo to ranch dressing. &#34;The downsizing tends to happen when manufacturers face some type of pricing pressure,&#34; he says. For example, if the price of gasoline or grain goes up.</p>   <p>That is why, when the government began reporting surges in inflation several months ago, Dworsky was on the lookout for its devious, shrinkifying cousin. We&#39;re now seeing a wave of shrinkflation, from <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb0650743229b1d1113e35515b00072bd3d30004d4181b17d3a73d24aa2e22b551c0ae1af34db14311eacdaa89aed18e52aa23e71">Tillamook ice cream</a> to <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507431e1f4f0280b3498124614ee117ed5303c3e2d79c0d7bd2e407ce14d19838c96f8dfeffe564bee25d18866e5c810739bb">Royal Canin cat food</a>. &#34;As we&#39;re seeing inflation picking up now, that&#39;s why I think you&#39;re going to see more items being downsized,&#34; Dworksy says. &#34;And maybe it&#39;s going to be a double-whammy: We&#39;re going to see some products going up in price at the same time that you&#39;re actually getting less in the package.&#34;</p>   <h3>A taller cereal box does not always mean more cereal</h3>   <p>Not all consumers are oblivious to shrinkflation. </p>   <p>Jonathan Fitzer is a big fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, another cereal made by General Mills. A couple of weeks ago, he went to a local grocery store in Tampa, Fla., to re-up. But on the shelf were two different versions of the product. The old box was the same as always. The new box, however, was taller and skinnier. And it was adorned with a picture advertising <em>Space Jam</em>, a new movie reboot starring LeBron James. Fitzer might have been forgiven for assuming a taller cereal box meant more cereal. &#34;And then I looked at the bottom and I saw the numbers were off and I was like, &#39;oh, come on now. I&#39;m getting ripped off here,&#39;&#34; he says.</p>   <p>Fitzer follows the &#34;<a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432f2bfd26774ea4b8146bf3e8dc7c43362b5295f18affbd056a03bee12a66164047608564f148cf679ae136883c160bd5">r/shrinkflation</a>&#34; thread on Reddit, and he uploaded a picture of the two boxes on the site. &#34;That&#39;s crazy shrinkage,&#34; <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507433752e0d0d585ecb379c99c8ac2424c4748126cbe843d99df8fb7ac73e5b6ed765014ce44f31544a76d3abc304ed111b7">said one commenter</a>. Another had words for the makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch: &#34;Why ya being shady, yo?&#34;</p>   <div id="res1012410339">

   <p>Last week, <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb06507432b19006ec32478bb0ef7e1247060a85e399c5a1c4cb8b79bef504ee8cb0910db43548194adaed454d041e5aebc72be01">General Mills announced</a> the rising cost of ingredients, packaging, labor, and trucking was forcing it to revamp its business. It said that it was taking &#34;pricing actions&#34; and other steps to grapple with this inflation. We reached out to General Mills about reports that it&#39;s downsizing its cereals as part of its strategy.</p>   <p>&#34;General Mills has been working to create consistency and standardization across our cereal products, making it easier for shoppers to distinguish between sizes on shelf. For consumers seeking the best price per ounce, the most value is normally in our larger boxes of cereal,&#34; says Kelsey Roemhildt, a General Mills spokesperson. &#34;This change also allows more efficient truck loading leading to fewer trucks on the road and fewer gallons of fuel used, which is important in both reducing global emissions as well as offsetting increased costs associated with inflation.&#34;</p>   <p>General Mills&#39; reframing of its shrinkflation seems to be pretty typical of Corporate America. Companies often sell downsizing as a way to help the environment, offer consumers more choice, or improve the quality of their products. When a spokesperson for Charmin, for example, was confronted by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=72e439fcb065074353590c90100e375352895576ae8d747bdf88b7848805445710e057dc19de67a4c2010405c4fb5d464678205f59a5ca49">reporters at WBUR</a> about shrinking the size of their toilet sheet squares, she suggested it was the result of &#34;innovations&#34; that allow consumers to, basically, wipe their butts more efficiently.</p>   <p>If this keeps up, maybe someday we&#39;ll all be living in a Lilliputian dystopia where we&#39;re forced to eat miniature candy bars, drink tiny drinks, and wipe our bottoms with teeny-tiny squares of paper. Or maybe consumers will start to notice and voice concern and the power of consumer demand will force companies to listen and right-size their products. Until then, our prayers are with the lovers of Cocoa Puffs.</p>   <p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter segment? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

      <title>SEC Charges Decentralized Finance Lender for Raising $30M</title>
      <link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>Case Is Agency’s First Involving Securities Using DeFi Technology</h2></p><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Aug. 6, 2021 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Florida men and their Cayman Islands company for unregistered sales of more than $30 million of securities using smart contracts and so-called “decentralized finance” (DeFi) technology, and for misleading investors concerning the operations and profitability of their business DeFi Money Market.   </p>

<p>According to the SEC’s order, Gregory Keough, Derek Acree, and their company Blockchain Credit Partners offered and sold securities in unregistered offerings through DeFi Money Market from February 2020 to February 2021. The order finds that they used smart contracts to sell two types of digital tokens: mTokens that could be purchased using specified digital assets and that paid 6.25 percent interest, and DMG “governance tokens” that purportedly gave holders certain voting rights, a share of excess profits, and the ability to profit from DMG governance token resales in the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the order, in offering and selling mTokens and DMG governance tokens, the respondents stated that DeFi Money Market could pay the interest and profits because it would use investor assets to buy “real world” assets that generated income, like car loans.  However, the order finds that after publicly unveiling DMM, the respondents realized that DeFi Money Market could not operate as promised because the price volatility of the digital assets used to purchase the tokens created risk that the income generated through income-generating assets would be insufficient to cover appreciation of investors’ principal.  The order finds that rather than notifying investors of this roadblock, the respondents misrepresented how the company was operating, including by falsely claiming that DeFi Money Market had bought car loans that they displayed on DeFi Money Market’s website.  While the respondents controlled another company that owned car loans, DeFi Money Market never acquired an ownership interest in any of those loans. Instead, the order finds that the respondents used personal funds and funds from the other company they controlled to make principal and interest payments for mToken redemptions. </p>

<p>“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws – no matter what technologies are used to offer and sell those securities,” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “This allows investors to make informed decisions and prevents issuers from misleading the public about business operations.”</p>

<p>“The federal securities laws apply with equal force to age-old frauds wrapped in today’s latest technology,” said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. “Here, the labeling of the offering as decentralized and the securities as governance tokens did not hinder us from ensuring that DeFi Money Market was immediately shut down and that investors were paid back.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s order finds that the mTokens were notes and were also offered and sold as investment contracts, the DMG governance tokens were offered and sold as investment contracts, and the respondents violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 by conducting unregistered offers and sales of both types of digital assets. The SEC’s order also finds that Respondents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</p>

<p>Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC’s order, respondents consented to a cease-and-desist order that includes disgorgement totaling $12,849,354 and penalties of $125,000 each for Keough and Acree. In addition, prior to the issuance of this order, the respondents funded the smart contracts so that mToken holders could redeem their mTokens and receive all principal and interest owed.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Brent Mitchell, Stephanie Reinhart, and Gregory Smolar and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Ana Petrovic of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit with assistance from trial counsel Kristin Murnahan and the Enforcement Division’s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. </p>

<p>I just added half-precision floats to Futhark, as the type <code>f16</code>. This wasn’t particularly hard (perhaps a day of work), but it was <em>annoying</em> for fairly shallow technical reasons, so as a bit of catharsis, here’s a blog post about the challenges I encountered.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a href="#why" id="why-link" title="why">Why</a></h3>
<p>First of all, why do we even <em>want</em> 16-bit floats? Their precision is horrible and the largest representable value is a mere 65504. Apparently 16-bit floats were used by various exotic processors in the early 80s, but the modern lineage, as eventually standardised by IEEE 754-2008, hails from graphics programming. This is because half-precision floats can be useful for expressing light intensities, as they are <em>accurate enough</em>, while allowing much larger dynamic range than a 16-bit fixed point number. Initially, half-precision was only used as a storage format, but eventually GPUs grew support for operating directly on half-precision floats; often with twice the arithmetic throughput. Since they only take up half as much space in memory as single-precision floats (and hence also use half the memory bandwidth), they are in theory “twice as fast” as single-precision floats.</p>
<p>Half-precision floats have also become increasingly popular for use in machine learning applications, as it appears neural networks are resistant to numerical problems (presumably they just train around them). But this is where things get interesting: there are actually (at least) <em>two</em> half-precision float formats. All take up 16 bits in memory, but differ in how they allocate those bits to significand and exponent. The one we support in Futhark is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format#ARM_alternative_half-precision">the <em>binary16</em> format from IEEE 754-2008</a>, but Google has also developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format">bfloat16</a> for use in AI accelerators. ARM apparently also supports a nonstandard variation of binary16, but I’m hoping I will never have to learn the details.</p>
<p>So we want to support half-precision floats because some applications can make use of them, either because they take up less space or because computation on them is actually faster.</p>
<h3 id="how"><a href="#how" id="how-link" title="how">How</a></h3>
<p>Half-precision floats are standardised in IEEE 754-2008, but they are <em>not</em> a universally supported type in common programming languages. In particular, ISO C does not support them. Other languages have unusual restrictions where <code>half</code> is supported as a “storage type” (meaning you can put them in memory), but you need to convert them to some other type (e.g. <code>float</code>) if you actually want to do arithmetic on them. This is not how we want to do it in Futhark. The <code>f16</code> type should be fully supported like any other primitive type, and on all systems. When necessary, the compiler must generate code to paper over lack of hardware support.</p>
<h4 id="c"><a href="#c" id="c-link" title="c">C</a></h4>
<p>Most of Futhark’s backends generate C code - either plain CPU C, OpenCL C, or CUDA C. Let’s start with plain C, which does not support a <code>half</code> type. One option would be representing <code>f16</code> as a 16-bit integer and then implementing every single arithmetic operation manually. <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">People have done so</a>, but such code runs extremely slowly. Instead, we simply <code>typedef float f16</code> and actually perform the <code>f16</code> operations in single precision. However, we don’t want these simulated floats to take up 32 bits per element in memory, so we distinguish between the <em>scalar type</em> used for operations, which is <code>float</code>, and the <em>storage type</em> used for arrays, which is <code>uint16_t</code>. When reading an <code>f16</code> from an array, we must use a function to convert from the storage type to the scalar type - fortunately, the library linked above contained such a function and its inverse. This means that <code>f16</code> operations might produce different results depending on whether they are emulated or not, as emulation only performs the rounding at the end, while true <code>f16</code> calculations might also round intermediate results. I’m not sufficiently experienced with numerical analysis, or the guarantees of IEEE 754, to say whether this is a real problem.</p>
<p>We also have a problem with <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-09-26-calling-futhark-from-c-and-haskell.html">Futhark’s C API</a>. Normally an entry point that returns a scalar will be exposed as a C function that produces a value of the obvious type (<code>int32_t</code> for <code>i32</code> and so on), but C does not have a <code>half</code> type. Again we fall back to the notion of “storage type” and return <code>f16</code> results as <code>uint16_t</code>. Life would be so much easier if <code>half</code> was universally supported.</p>
<h4 id="opencl"><a href="#opencl" id="opencl-link" title="opencl">OpenCL</a></h4>
<p>Let’s move on to the OpenCL backend. Surely life is easier there! No, it never is. OpenCL <em>does</em> actually define a <code>half</code> type, but only as a storage format, meaning you can have pointers to them, but not perform any arithmetic, unless the platform in question supports the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/cl_khr_fp16.html"><code>cl_khr_fp16</code></a> extension (and you enable it). OpenCL platforms are loaded dynamically followed by run-time compilation at kernels, so the Futhark compiler does not know at compile-time whether the target platform supports half-precision. Therefore we generate <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/scalar_f16.h#L11-L34">kernel code with plenty of #ifdefs</a> to detect whether the platform supports <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, and fall back to <code>float</code>-based emulation otherwise. Remarkably, OpenCL <em>does</em> provide builtin functions for <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/vload_half.html">efficiently translating between single-precision and half-precision floats stored in memory</a>, even for those platforms that don’t have <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>. This lets us load half-precision floats into single-precision scalars at quite high speed. I noticed about an order of magnitude difference compared to the hand-written conversion function. This is quite important, since for some reason, NVIDIA’s OpenCL implementation does <em>not</em> support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, despite their GPUs being fully capable.</p>
<p>As a delightful quirk, the OpenCL emulator <a href="https://github.com/jrprice/Oclgrind">Oclgrind</a> claims to support <code>cl_khr_fp16</code>, but will fail to actually perform any operations on <code>half</code> values. Futhark users will never use Oclgrind, but it is an absolutely indispensable tool for hacking on the compiler, and is used in our regression test suite as well. The solution is an <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/master/rts/c/opencl.h#L739-L743">ad-hoc check to always emulate half-precision on Oclgrind</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cuda"><a href="#cuda" id="cuda-link" title="cuda">CUDA</a></h4>
<p>Okay, time for CUDA. NVIDIA has been marketing half-precision hard, so <em>surely</em> everything will just work out, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, CUDA does indeed support half-precision floats on devices that are Compute Capability 6.0 or newer. This can be checked with an <code>#ifdef</code>. However, for some strange reason, you have to include a special header file, <code>cuda_fp16.h</code>, to actually get access to the <code>half</code> type and its operations. Glancing at the header file, it looks like <code>half</code> is actually implemented as a C++ class with inline PTX (CUDA assembly) to perform the computations using the natively supported half-precision instructions. This is quite baroque. Why isn’t the <code>half</code> type just implemented in the compiler, like it is in OpenCL?</p>
<p>I <em>suspect</em> the reason is that CUDA is mostly a “single source” programming model where the same program contains both CPU and GPU code, where the CPU code is ultimately compiled with the system compiler - which does not support half-precision floats. In contrast, OpenCL C is specifically for “device” code (read: GPU code), and the “host” (CPU) is completely out of its purview. Futhark does not use CUDA in a “single source” manner, but instead uses <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html">NVRTC</a> to do run-time compilation of CUDA kernels, very similar to how OpenCL works.</p>
<p>The need to include <code>cuda_fp16.h</code> is not just a compiler implementation curiosity - it turns out to present the <em>greatest</em> annoyance in this entire cavalcade of accidental complexity. Apparently when you run-time compile a CUDA kernel with NVRTC, the default search path does not include the CUDA include directory, so <em>this header cannot be found</em>. Whoever calls the NVRTC API must explicitly provide the directory containing this header. This is <em>bad</em>. I’ve long sought to ensure Futhark didn’t <a href="https://gist.github.com/cookrn/4015437">contribute to the growing accidental complexity disaster</a>, with new configuration files and environment variables being my main aversion.</p>
<p>But now it seems we have no choice. Futhark <em>must</em> be able to figure out, at run-time, where CUDA is installed, and there is no standard for this. Sure, it’s often in <code>/usr/local/cuda</code>, but it’s fairly common to put it somewhere in <code>/opt</code> as well, especially on supercomputer systems. And there is <em>no standard environment variable</em> pointing at the CUDA directory! Other GPU applications respect any or all or <code>CUDA_HOME</code>, <code>CUDA_PATH</code>, and <code>CUDA_ROOT</code>. And, to my great regret, <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/blob/23956cc4e432e1cfbff9d3908fd8863dfaed6640/rts/c/cuda.h#L348-L358">now Futhark does as well</a>.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy and a shame. There is no good reason that is has to be this way. I <em>know</em> that this will result in things not working down the line, just because a user didn’t set an invisible global variable correctly. I still hope that I just missed a subtle detail somewhere, and that this will eventually go away like a bad dream.</p>

<p>Half-precision floats are the worst IEEE floats in all ways except speed. So are they faster in Futhark? Sort of. On an A100 GPU, the expression <code>f16.sum</code> can sum one billion half-precision floats in <em>2.1ms</em>, while <code>f32.sum</code> takes <em>2.9ms</em> to sum one billion single-precision floats. That’s a speedup of <em>1.38x</em>, which is much less than the <em>2x</em> we would theoretically expect. So what’s going wrong? Two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Adding two half-precision floats on their own is probably not faster than adding two single-precision floats. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF.html#group__CUDA__MATH__INTRINSIC__HALF">CUDA’s half-precision API</a> strongly implies one should consider using <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC.html#group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC">the <code>half2</code> type</a>, which packs two half-precision numbers in 32 bits, and allows “vectorised” operations on both in a single instruction. As far as I understand current hardware, this is the way half-precision floats can achieve high arithmetic throughput. I don’t know if the CUDA compiler will optimise multiple <code>half</code>s into <code>half2</code>s on its own, but I doubt it - especially for a reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis above is valid, but it’s not actually what is happening here. This summation is <em>completely</em> bandwidth-bound, so the only thing that matters is how efficiently we access memory. In <code>f16.sum</code>, each thread reads a 16-bit value at a time. While the Futhark compiler arranges things so that the accesses are fully <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu/coalesced">coalesced</a>, the GPU’s memory architecture is not really designed for individual threads issuing such small reads - perhaps each thread will actually read (at least) 32 bits, then throw half of it away. In any case, the result is that the memory bus is not fully utilised.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A more efficient half-precision reduction would have each thread read multiple packed values with a single transaction, such as by reading a 32-bit <code>half2</code>. This is a trick we’ll have to teach the compiler at some point. This is also not a new concern - if you write a program that sums 8-bit or 16-bit integers, you are also not fully utilising the memory bus, even if in absolute runtime, it’s still faster than summing the same number of 32-bit integers.</p>
<p>How do we verify that this analysis is correct? We can write a program that interprets an array of <code>u32</code> values as packed <code>f16</code>s, using a <code>map</code>-<code>reduce</code> composition:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>map (\x -&gt; f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x&gt;&gt;<span>16</span>)) +</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>           f16.from_bits(u16.u32(x)))</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>&gt;-&gt; f16.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can sum the equivalent of a billion <code>f16</code>s (that is, half a billion <code>u32</code>s) in a mere <em>1.5ms</em> - a <em>1.93x</em> speedup over <code>f32</code> summation.</p>
<h3 id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats"><a href="#so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats" id="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats-link" title="so-should-you-use-single-precision-floats">So should you use single-precision floats?</a></h3>
<p>Unless you know what you are doing, you probably should not use <code>f16</code> in your code. Their numerical properties are absolutely going to bite you. Interoperability is awkward and the performance isn’t even that great <em>yet</em>. But from a language perspective they are now fully supported, and hopefully we’ll make them run even faster in a not too distant future. But I doubt we’ll add more bits, so the numerics are always going to be dubious.</p>

	<p>Postgres.app is a full-featured PostgreSQL installation packaged as a standard Mac app.
It includes everything you need to get started:
we’ve even included popular extensions like <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> for geo data and <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">plv8</a> for JavaScript.</p>

<p>Postgres.app has a beautiful user interface and a convenient menu bar item.
You never need to touch the command line to use it – but of course we do include all the necessary <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html">command line tools</a> and header files for advanced users.</p>

<p>Postgres.app can install minor updates automatically, so you get bugfixes as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="installing-postgresapp">Installing Postgres.app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Download   ➜   Move to Applications folder   ➜   Double Click</p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t move Postgres.app to the Applications folder, you will see a warning about an unidentified developer and won&#39;t be able to open it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click &#34;Initialize&#34; to create a new server</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Configure your <tt>$PATH</tt> to use the included command line tools (optional):</p>
		<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &amp;&amp;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Done! You now have a PostgreSQL server running on your Mac with these default settings:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>Host</td>
		<td>localhost</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Port</td>
		<td>5432</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User</td>
		<td>your system user name</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database</td>
		<td>same as user</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Password</td>
		<td>none</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Connection URL</td>
		<td>postgresql://localhost</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To connect with psql, double click a database. To connect directly from the command line, type <code>psql</code>. If you’d rather use a graphical client, see below.</p>

<p>NOTE: These instructions assume that you’ve never installed PostgreSQL on your Mac before.
If you have previously installed PostgreSQL using homebrew, MacPorts, the EnterpriseDB installer, consider <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/remove.html">removing other PostgreSQL installations</a> first.
We also have <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/update.html">instructions for upgrading from older versions of Postgres.app</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graphical-clients">Graphical Clients</h2>

<p>Postgres.app includes <code>psql</code>, a versatile command line client for PostgreSQL.
But it’s not the only option; there are plenty of great graphical clients available for PostgreSQL.
Two popular tools are:</p>

<ul>
	<li id="pgadmin"><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a></li>
	<li id="postico"><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org">pgAdmin 4</a> is a feature rich open source PostgreSQL client.
It has support for almost every feature in PostgreSQL.
The only downside is that the cross-plattform UI really doesn’t live up to the expectations of a native Mac app.</p>

<p><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> on the other hand, is a very modern Mac app.
It’s made by the same people that maintain Postgres.app, and we think you’ll like it! 
We put a lot of effort into making it a joy to use.
However, it doesn’t have the extensive feature set of pgAdmin, and it’s a commercial app rather than open source.</p>

<p>Aside from those two options, there are a lot more to choose from! Check the documentation for a <a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/gui-tools.html">list of amazing Mac apps for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-connect">How to connect</h2>

<p>After your PostgreSQL server is up and running, you’ll probably want to connect to it from your application.
Here’s how to connect to PostgreSQL from popular programming languages and frameworks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt onclick="this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName(&#39;active&#39;)[0].className=&#39;&#39;;this.className=&#39;active&#39;;">PHP</dt>
	<dd>
			<p>
				To connect from PHP, make sure that it supports PostgreSQL.
				The version included with macOS doesn&#39;t support PostgreSQL.
				We recommend <a href="https://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a> for an easy way to install a current version of PHP that works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use PDO (object oriented):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$db = new PDO(&#39;pgsql:host=localhost&#39;);
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
$statement-&gt;execute();
while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
    echo &#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34; . htmlspecialchars($row[&#34;datname&#34;]) . &#34;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;;
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				Or the <tt>pg_connect()</tt> functions (procedural):
			</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;?php
$conn = pg_connect(&#34;host=localhost&#34;);
$result = pg_query($conn, &#34;SELECT datname FROM pg_database&#34;);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {

      <p>Joseph Allen runs a major public health research project at Harvard University, probing how indoor air quality affects human health and cognition. He consults with companies on ventilation and air filtration, and during the pandemic he became a prominent voice on public health, writing dozens of op-eds criticizing early guidance from health authorities and debunking misconceptions about how the virus spreads. But none of it would have happened if he hadn’t washed out as an FBI recruit.</p>

<p>The son of a New York City homicide detective who opened his own investigative agency, Allen spent his teens and 20s helping with the family business. He did surveillance, undercover work, computer forensics, and skiptrace—tracking down people who left town to avoid alimony. Eventually he took over the agency, leading investigations and supervising eight agents.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the work and thought it was challenging,” Allen recalls. But part of him always wanted to be a scientist. He majored in environmental science at Boston College, and in his late 20s, still torn, he began to apply to graduate school even as he started the process to become an FBI agent. After 2 years of interviews and testing, the last step was a routine polygraph test. He failed the first round—the trick questions he was asked were so obvious that he could not take them seriously. So FBI flew in one of its toughest examiners from Iraq—a hulking, jackbooted guy who got right in Allen’s face, screaming that he knew he was lying. But Allen kept cool, and after a while, the interrogator stormed out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>“I thought he would come back in the room and say, ‘Congratulations,’ cause I’m thinking I’m crushing it,” Allen recalls. “But they failed me because they said I employed countermeasures.” FBI apparently didn’t want an agent who couldn’t be unnerved by a polygraph test. And that solved Allen’s career dilemma. “I guarantee I’m the only public health student ever to fail an FBI lie detector polygraph in the morning and start graduate school a few hours later,” Allen says. But his investigative instincts never left him.</p>

<p>A tall, athletic-looking man with a bald head and stylish stubble, Allen directs the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where he studies the effects of toxic gases emitted from furniture, carpets, and paints; stale air; and high levels of carbon dioxide. Years of studies by Allen and others have shown poorly circulated air in buildings impairs our ability to think clearly and creatively. Considering that we spend more than 90% of our lifetimes indoors, those findings have implications for personal well-being—and for businesses concerned about their bottom line.</p>

<p>“Joe has always had a unique understanding of this range of domains—from how buildings work, to environmental exposure assessment, to making connections with health outcomes,” says Brent Stephens, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. “There’s not a tremendous number of people in this world that have worked on that whole spectrum.”</p>

<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, the previously esoteric field of indoor air quality suddenly became the focus of widespread concern. Like many of his colleagues, Allen jumped into the fray, advising school systems, police departments, entertainment companies, the Boston Symphony, and a host of other entities on how to make their indoor air healthier, during the pandemic and afterward.</p>

<p>“COVID really changed the conversation,” says Matt Murray, vice president of leasing at Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded developer in the United States and one of Allen’s consulting clients. Before the pandemic, the company would have to explain to bored executives why they should pay attention to indoor air. “Now, the CEOs are all saying, ‘What filters do you use? How you process the air you bring into the workspace?’” Murray says. “And we’re ready for those conversations because we’ve been working with Joe.”</p>

<p><span>After he failed</span> his FBI exam, Allen became a different kind of sleuth. For his doctoral thesis at the Boston University School of Public Health, he investigated toxic flame-retardant chemicals released into the air by furniture, and found they were nearly ubiquitous. (The chemicals were later banned.) After graduation he got a job with a consulting firm, where he investigated problems such as toxic emissions from drywall and outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, which is caused by bacteria that grow in plumbing and become aerosolized by ventilation systems, showers, or even flushed toilets. Those investigations introduced him to “sick building syndrome,” a problem first identified in the 1970s in which the occupants experience fatigue, itchy eyes, headaches, and other symptoms. Exactly what causes these ailments isn’t clear, but exposure to contaminated air is a likely culprit. Allen became convinced that the building you work in can have more impact on your health than your doctor.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  
  
      <p>The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated.</p>
  
  
</blockquote>

  
  
      <p>In 2014, Allen accepted a position at Harvard, where he soon turned his attention to how the indoor environment can affect people’s cognitive abilities. Many of us have struggled to pay attention during a long staff meeting in a stuffy conference room. Research by Allen and others suggests that lassitude may not be due solely to boredom, but also to the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-rich conference room air.</p>

<p>Ever since the energy shocks of the 1970s, buildings in the United States have been made as airtight and energy-efficient as possible. The result was a buildup of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled CO<sub>2</sub>. “Green building standards” introduced in the late ’90s focused on reducing toxic materials and making buildings healthier as well as more sustainable, but they didn’t prioritize indoor air quality and ultimately did little to improve it.</p>

<p>In a multiyear series of experiments, Allen and his team have investigated the consequences. In the first study, published in 2015, they had 24 white-collar volunteers spend six working days in environmentally controlled office spaces at Syracuse University’s Total Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. On various days the experimenters would alter ventilation rates and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs. Each afternoon the volunteers were tested on their ability to think analytically and react to a crisis. (One test, for example put the volunteer in the role of a small-town mayor trying to react to an emergency.) All tests were double-blind: Neither the volunteers nor the study personnel knew that day’s environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The results were dramatic. When volunteers worked in well-ventilated conditions (which lowered the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and VOCs), they scored 61% higher than when they worked in typical office building conditions. When they worked in the cleanest conditions, with even lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels and higher ventilation rates, their scores climbed 101%.</p>

<p>To find out whether the results held up in the real world, Allen and his team recruited 109 volunteers from 10 office buildings across the United States. Six had been renovated to create better heat and humidity control, improve ventilation, and lower the use of toxic materials. Four had not. Allen’s team gave each office worker a Fitbit-like bracelet to record heart rate, skin temperature, sleep patterns, and other physiological signs of well-being. Workers also completed a survey each day about how comfortable they felt and whether they experienced symptoms such as drowsiness or headaches. At the end of the week, they took the cognitive tests. Workers in the buildings with good ventilation and lower levels of indoor pollution scored 26.4% higher than those in the unimproved buildings. They also reported sleeping better and experiencing fewer “sick building” symptoms.</p>

  <figcaption><p>Many sources of indoor air pollution can affect human health and cognition. These include particles and gases emitted by furniture and building materials, as well as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exhaled by a building’s occupants. Choosing better materials and improving ventilation, filtration, and air processing can help make buildings healthier.</p>

      <p>“This is really important, interesting work,” says Elliott Gall, an indoor air scientist at Portland State University. “It’s a great example of the kind of interdisciplinary work [that explores] the complexity of indoor air and how it affects us.”</p>

<p>Over time, Allen came to see businesspeople as natural allies who could act on his public health findings faster than government officials. He teamed up with John Macomber, a Harvard Business School lecturer and former CEO of one of the largest construction companies in New England. Macomber was impressed with Allen’s research suggesting a tiny sacrifice in energy efficiency through improved ventilation could increase a business’s bottom line by as much as 10% by decreasing absenteeism and boosting worker productivity. “I realized we’ve been missing the boat,” Macomber says. “We’re chasing pennies on energy when there’s thousands of dollars in productivity issues.”</p>

<p>Allen and Macomber consulted with companies and spoke at corporate conferences, making the economic case for improving ventilation and filtration as well as adjusting lighting, temperature, and humidity. “The idea of a healthy building has been made too complicated,” they wrote in a book they co-authored, <em>Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity</em>. “There are just a handful of things we need to do to make a building healthier.”</p>

<p>Allen’s group continued to investigate how the indoor environment affects our mental state. They found that airline pilots exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> levels common in cockpits did worse on Federal Aviation Administration–mandated emergency response tests than when they breathed better air. They showed that during a heat wave, students who lived in non–air-conditioned dorms had slower reaction times and poorer problem-solving skills than those with air conditioning. They showed that bringing plants and views of nature into the workplace can lower office workers’ heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological indicators of stress.</p>

<p>In 2019, Allen’s team embarked on an ambitious international project to examine the long-term impacts of indoor air quality by tracking the physical and cognitive health of more than 300 office workers in 43 buildings in six countries over the course of 1 year. They mailed each worker a wristband to monitor their physiology and a small sensor to continuously measure levels of fine particulates and CO<sub>2</sub> in their workspace. At predetermined times and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and particulates, the program pinged each worker’s smartphone with a quiz to test reaction time and cognitive function. The studies showed that in offices across the world, poor ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub>, and particulates (which carry VOCs) conspire to significantly impair cognitive function.</p>

<p><span>When the first reports</span> of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Allen realized his years researching air quality and disease transmission in indoor environments had new relevance. “Even though the virus was novel, there are elements in all this that feel quite familiar,” he says. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a radiological hazard, biological hazard, or chemical hazard. We know how to assess the risk and put in appropriate controls.”</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) latched onto the idea that the virus was spread by large, exhaled droplets that float for a short time and then settle on surfaces. But scientists specializing in aerosols knew airborne viruses are more likely to ride on tinier particles exhaled when people breathe, sneeze, cough, or talk. Smaller than 5 microns, these particles can travel across a room and linger in indoor air for hours.</p>

<p>Aerosol experts such as Lidia Morawska of Australia’s Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point; Donald Milton of the University of Maryland, College Park; and Linsey Marr of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University argued that the focus on larger droplets had led to wrong-headed guidance about washing packages with bleach, staying 2 meters apart—even outdoors—and other forms of what some researchers called “hygiene theater.” They urged policies that emphasized indoor mask wearing and less draconian regulations for people outdoors, where the virus would quickly disperse.</p>

<p>Allen signed on to that fight, collaborating with aerosol experts and public health researchers on scientific papers and bringing their case to the public. “He’s a really good public communicator,” says Marr, who credits Allen with helping her work get the attention it deserves.</p>

<p>“One of our biggest frustrations over the past year is that we knew enough to act early on,” Allen says. “Even by late January 2020 we knew that airborne transmission of aerosols was not only likely, but probable.” Waiting for proof made no sense. “This was a pandemic, an all-in moment, so why wouldn’t we have immediately deployed every strategy that could have helped?” Those strategies, Allen knew from his research, include bringing more outside air into chronically underventilated buildings and using higher efficiency filters in ventilation units.</p>

      <p>He started waking up at 4 a.m. to write opinion pieces. His first two, in the <em>Financial Times </em>and <em>The New York Times</em>, argued that buildings, if properly ventilated, could be formidable weapons in the fight against the virus. He and his team had measured air flow in schoolrooms under various conditions, and Allen explained that schools could easily be made safe by opening windows and buying the kind of high-efficiency particulate air purifiers sold at local home stores.</p>

<p>So much of his writing involved correcting misimpressions that he felt he was playing editorial whack-a-mole. No, he argued, you do not have to wipe your groceries with bleach. No, you do not have to avoid exercising outside. No, schools do not need to install costly air-purifying systems.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Morawska and Milton wrote an open letter to WHO—a full-throated appeal to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission. Allen was among 237 other scientists in 32 countries who signed on to the letter, which urged greater emphasis on indoor air quality. But WHO continued to downplay the importance of aerosol transmission. “I think some of the reluctance was that if [health authorities] say a disease is airborne, we’d have to provide N95 masks for every health worker and have negative pressure rooms in every hospital, which wasn’t possible,” Marr says.</p>

<p>Later that month, Allen and his Harvard colleague Parham Azimi published a study in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </em>that used computer modeling to reconstruct the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak on the <em>Diamond Princess </em>cruise ship. By mapping the ship’s ventilation system and the locations of people who came down with the disease, they showed that only aerosols, not larger droplets, could have traveled the necessary distances through the ducts. Similar findings emerged from studies by Marr, Morawska, and others.</p>

<p>Finally, in early May, after a series of persuasive papers in major journals, WHO and CDC acknowledged that the virus was transmitted primarily by fine aerosols. (Even then, the agencies issued no major announcements but simply changed the wording on their websites.) Since then, CDC has gone further, issuing recommendations for reopening schools that stress the importance of good ventilation in addition to vaccinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allen and his colleagues at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program created a website with a comprehensive guide to maintaining proper ventilation in schools, homes, and businesses. The website advises building managers to bring in as much outside air as possible—a room air exchange rate of four to six times per hour, more than double the rate in a typical office or school building. In buildings that recirculate interior air, managers should upgrade to hospital-grade MERV 13 filters, which remove up to 90% of particles 2.5 microns or smaller, rather than the typical MERV 8, which can remove as little as 20%.</p>

<p>The new focus on indoor air quality could help hasten the end of the current pandemic and perhaps even help forestall the next one. It may bring broader changes as well. Businesspeople are recognizing the value of improving indoor air to create better working conditions and add value to their properties. “What we’re seeing with some parts of the market—notably the higher end, real estate investment trusts, owners of multiple office buildings or apartments—is they’re thinking really hard about competing” in the post pandemic market, Macomber says. “And one way to compete is to have healthier buildings.”</p>

<p>Allen predicts that the new availability of cheap personal air quality monitors will quicken that competition and heighten people’s awareness of the indoor environment. Previously, the only way to assess indoor air quality was to hire an expensive consultant. Now, with monitors available online for less than a couple of hundred dollars, any office worker or hotel guest can quickly monitor CO<sub>2</sub>; some devices even detect VOCs. If consumers post results on websites like Yelp, businesses would be forced to pay attention. (Indeed, some building owners already boast about air quality in advertisements.)</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a fundamental rebalancing in terms of how we think about indoor spaces,” Allen says. “I think that people won’t tolerate sick buildings, where you feel tired, your eyes itch, you have a headache, or you’re stuffed into a closetlike office with no windows.” It’s one lasting positive from the pandemic. “That era is over,” Allen says. “Rightly so, and good riddance.”</p>

      <title>I compromised 300 stores and a “Spanish consultancy”</title>
      <link>https://edbrsk.dev/content/real-cases/how-I-compromised-300-stores-and-a-spanish-consultancy</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p></p>
<h2 id="part-1.-how-i-compromised-300-stores">Part 1. How I compromised 300 stores:</h2>
<p>I was on an online store, you know, to compare prices about something I wanted to buy. I got bored. I opened the Wappalyzer: Apache 2.4.46, Amazon EC2, PHP. Okay!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It all started as a “let’s see if this site is vulnerable to something or not”. I’m not gonna post names, and I’ll try to avoid any hints. The report about the vulnerabilities and the misconfigurations is still ongoing, so some issues may not be fixed everywhere yet.</p>
<p>It was not a Wordpress or another kind of CMS, okay… I checked the robots.txt. I found a panel to log in… I tried default credentials like admin/admin, etc., but were not working. Reading the footer of the log-in panel, I found two things. The store is part of a chain with more than 300 stores, and the CMS/Platform (I don’t know how to call it) was made by the same company. A little bit of “Googling” to confirm, and I found that <strong>ALL OF THEM</strong> have the same “CMS”, the same log-in panel, just a few differences like CSS, languages, etc. What if all of them have common credentials? Looks promising! 😅</p>
<p>Let’s scan the ports of this server to have a little bit more of information.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 21  open ftp  vsftpd 2.2.2</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 22  open ssh  OpenSSH 7.4</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 80  open http Apache httpd 2.4.48 Amazon OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.1.33</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>port</span> 443 open ssl  Apache httpd</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I exported the scan on a file to have an idea about the services running on the server.</p>
<p>I’m always trying the basic things first. I tried some reflected/persistent XSS, SQL Injection on the search bar, etc,. there are some params in the URL, so I thought that I could inject code there, but I wasn’t successful in the beginning. At that moment I thought: “Well… maybe the people that built this custom CMS are sanitizing the params, or using I don’t know, some framework that is doing that for them under the hood”. Not really. Have you ever read before about Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Attacks? The search bar has some filters to apply, so I tried some things on them, and BINGO! 😎</p>
<p><code>https://www.target.com/action?q=search_term&amp;VULNERABLE_PARAM=1; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code></p>
<p>The magic happens with the <code>; SELECT SLEEP(5)#</code> you can google more about it. The important thing here, is that I was able to dump the database. I was expecting just a few tables, the ones related with the site, but to my surprise there is just one schema with the name of this chain I saw before on the log in panel. This schema contains more than three thousand tables, yep, more than 3000 tables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point, I invest some time trying to figure out the tables. Some of them in English, others in Spanish, also temporary tables, theoretically, but the interesting one was: <code>Usuarios</code>. I downloaded the data from this table, and a list of potential admin users, emails, phones, some tokens for purposes that I didn’t understand at that time, etc. At least the passwords were hashed.</p>
<p>I was kind of sad at this point. Thinking: “Well… this is the end. I found an SQL Injection, a <strong>lot of data</strong>, but nothing else.” My girlfriend and my dog suggested that I get off the computer, so I went to sleep. 🌖</p>
<p>I was searching for an inspirational quote to put it here, but I just came up with this one:</p>
<p><code>Every sunrise is a chance to think if you are on the correct path.</code></p>
<p></p>
<p>I wasn’t in the correct path. I had to figure out something else. I woke up, and I created a dictionary with data from the “Usuarios” table. Actually, brute force wasn’t needed. I got it on the first attempt. WTF? Seriously? 🤯 I got access to the dashboard as a Super Admin in less than 1 minute. The password of this guy was the same as his username. Nice! 👏🏼</p>
<p>I can’t upload a picture of it but imagine the common Bootstrap template for dashboards. I got access to <strong>everything</strong>: Orders, Discounts, Products, Clients, News/Posts, Newsletters, etc., and I had the permissions to do everything I wanted.</p>
<p>Is that a common practice of this company? Yes, it is. I haven’t tried the 300 stores, but I logged in to some of them as a Super Admin and I was able to login into other web pages that are not part of the chain with the same credentials.</p>
<p>I was lucky. I mean, in the end, it could just have been an SQL Injection, but you know… “Humans are the weakest link in the Cybersecurity chain.”</p>
<p>Let’s grab a beer, this is not the end. 🍺</p>
<h2 id="part-2.-how-i-compromised-a-spanish-consultancy">Part 2. How I compromised a “Spanish consultancy”:</h2>
<p>I thought about writing an email to these people, let them know about the vulnerabilities in their code, and the bad practices they have, but I didn’t at this point. I felt like I was able to find more things regarding this company. I used to work in consultancy before, and usually, these companies are involved in more than one project. So, I opened the browser, and I started to do a bit of “OSINT” about this company.</p>
<p>Valuable information I found:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company is involved in projects where are receiving money from &#34;concursos públicos&#34;.</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>(Projects for their &#34;Comunidad autónoma&#34; for example.)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The CMS it&#39;s not just being used in the 300 stores.</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>    - </span>It&#39;s also reused in other projects, and yes, the credentials I found are still valid.</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>- </span>The company was offering different (vulnerable) products some of them as a SAAS.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are more things, but I want to keep this post short if possible. At this point, I knew a few things about the company. I tried to find subdomains, and one of them potentially caught my attention.</p>
<p>The company uses <a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket Chat</a> (similar to Slack) under a subdomain, and you don’t need any VPN/2FA/whatever to log in. Figure out the credentials! Yeah, you are right! 😉 Our credentials works for the chat as well, and our guy has the Admin role.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All right, I was in! 🍾🥂 We could say that I was inside the company. At this point I was able to read private conversations with the employees, find words on public channels/private conversations, take a look at what they are saying about their clients… whatever I want… in the end, I logged in as their boss, and he has the Admin role.</p>
<p>Okay… Well, things I tried (and worked):</p>

<p>If we take a look at the ports scan I wrote above, we have ports 21/22 opened, right? So, let’s try to find the credentials in private conversations. Yep, I got FTP and SSH credentials!</p>
<p>At this point I was able to upload/download/modify the code, actually, this is how I found the database host + credentials because as you may know it’s quite common to have the credentials in some config file if you are not using, idk, AWS Secrets Manager or something similar.</p>
<p>Users are writing their credit cards here. Do you understand the risk of all of this?</p>
<p>Anyway… I was able to get a reverse shell and take a look to the server as well.</p>

<p>Having admin credentials, it’s critical per se. I mean, I can read their conversations about everything. However, we don’t have the credentials of everyone, looks like some employees are not following the bad practices, so their password is not their username. No worries, a little bit more “googling” and we can fix that!</p>
<h4 id="cookie-hijacking">Cookie Hijacking</h4>
<p>Rocket Chat allows you to create custom scripts in JavaScript. I was an admin, so, I could do that! The idea it’s create a script that does a request somewhere to save the <code>rc_uid</code> and <code>rc_token</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you have to be “creative?”. Let’s gonna create a simple PHP script and deploy it somewhere:</p>

      <title>An Open Letter Against Apple&#39;s Privacy-Invasive Content Scanning Technology</title>
      <link>https://appleprivacyletter.com/</link>
      <description></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___appleprivacyletter_com_/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="letter">
			<h2>Dear Apple,</h2>
			<p>
				On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" target="_blank">announced</a> new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of <em>“Expanded Protections for Children”</em>. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, <strong>Apple&#39;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Apple&#39;s proposed technology works by <strong>continuously monitoring all photos stored or shared on a user&#39;s iPhone, iPad or Mac</strong>, and notifying the authorities if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Immediately after Apple&#39;s announcement, experts around the world sounded the alarm on how Apple&#39;s proposed measures could turn every iPhone into a device that is continuously scanning all photos and messages that pass through it in order to report any objectionable content to law enforcement, setting a precedent where our personal devices become a radical new tool for invasive surveillance, with little oversight to prevent eventual abuse and unreasonable expansion of the scope of surveillance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation has said</a> that <strong><em>“Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“It’s impossible to build a client-side scanning system that can only be used for sexually explicit images sent or received by children. As a consequence, even a well-intentioned effort to build such a system will break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses […] That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://cdt.org/press/cdt-apples-changes-to-messaging-and-photo-services-threaten-users-security-and-privacy/" target="_blank">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> has said that it is <strong><em>“deeply concerned that Apple’s changes in fact create new risks to children and all users, and mark a significant departure from long-held privacy and security protocols”</em></strong>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Apple is replacing its industry-standard end-to-end encrypted messaging system with an infrastructure for surveillance and censorship, which will be vulnerable to abuse and scope-creep not only in the U.S., but around the world,” says Greg Nojeim, Co-Director of CDT’s Security &amp; Surveillance Project. “Apple should abandon these changes and restore its users’ faith in the security and integrity of their data on Apple devices and services.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Carmela Troncoso, a leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554795487518723" target="_blank">has said</a> that while <strong><em>“Apple&#39;s new detector for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is promoted under the umbrella of child protection and privacy, it is a firm step towards prevalent surveillance and control”</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Matthew D. Green, another leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green" target="_blank">has said</a> that <strong><em>“yesterday we were gradually headed towards a future where less and less of our information had to be under the control and review of anyone but ourselves. For the first time since the 1990s we were taking our privacy back. Today we’re on a different path”</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/" target="_blank">adding</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“The pressure is going to come from the UK, from the US, from India, from China. I&#39;m terrified about what that&#39;s going to look like. Why Apple would want to tell the world, ‘Hey, we&#39;ve got this tool’?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Sarah Jamie Lewis, Executive Director of the <a href="https://openprivacy.ca" target="_blank">Open Privacy Research Society</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1423403656733290496" target="_blank">has warned</a> that:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“If Apple are successful in introducing this, how long do you think it will be before the same is expected of other providers? Before walled-garden prohibit apps that don&#39;t do it? Before it is enshrined in law? How long do you think it will be before the database is expanded to include &#34;terrorist&#34; content&#34;? &#34;harmful-but-legal&#34; content&#34;? state-specific censorship?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Dr. Nadim Kobeissi, a researcher in Security &amp; Privacy issues, <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423388549529968645">warned</a>:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				”Apple sells iPhones without FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, because local regulation prohibits encrypted phone calls. That&#39;s just one example of many where Apple&#39;s bent to local pressure. What happens when local regulations in Saudi Arabia mandate that messages be scanned not for child sexual abuse, but for homosexuality or for offenses against the monarchy?”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life" target="_blank">statement</a> on the issue supports the above concern with additional examples on how Apple&#39;s proposed technology could lead to global abuse:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Take the example of India, where recently passed rules include dangerous requirements for platforms to identify the origins of messages and pre-screen content. New laws in Ethiopia requiring content takedowns of “misinformation” in 24 hours may apply to messaging services. And many other countries—often those with authoritarian governments—have passed similar laws. Apple’s changes would enable such screening, takedown, and reporting in its end-to-end messaging. The abuse cases are easy to imagine: governments that outlaw homosexuality might require the classifier to be trained to restrict apparent LGBTQ+ content, or an authoritarian regime might demand the classifier be able to spot popular satirical images or protest flyers.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Furthermore, the Electronic Frontier Foundation insists that it&#39;s already seen this mission creep in action: <strong><em>“one of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of “terrorist” content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content. The database, managed by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), is troublingly without external oversight, despite calls from civil society.”</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Fundamental design flaws in Apple&#39;s proposed approach have also been pointed out by experts, who have <a href="https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1423387147172724741" target="_blank">claimed</a> that <strong><em>“Apple can trivially use different media fingerprinting datasets for each user. For one user it could be child abuse, for another it could be a much broader category”</em></strong>, thereby enabling selective content tracking for targeted users.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type of technology that Apple is proposing for its child protection measures depends on an expandable infrastructure that can&#39;t be monitored or technically limited. Experts have <a href="https://twitter.com/carmelatroncoso/status/1423554811086188548" target="_blank">repeatedly warned</a> that the problem isn&#39;t just privacy, but also the lack of accountability, technical barriers to expansion, and lack of analysis or even acknowledgement of the potential for errors and false positives.
 			</p>
			 <p>
				 Kendra Albert, a lawyer at the Harvard Law School&#39;s Cyberlaw Clinic, <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114" target="_blank">has warned</a> that <strong><em>“these &#34;child protection&#34; features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse”</em></strong>, adding:
			 </p>
			 <blockquote>
				“I just know (calling it now) that these machine learning algorithms are going to flag transition photos. Good luck texting your friends a picture of you if you have &#34;female presenting nipples.&#34;”
			 </blockquote>
			 <h3>Our Request</h3>
			 <p>
				 We, the undersigned, ask that:
			 </p>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Apple Inc.&#39;s&#39; deployment of its proposed content monitoring technology is halted immediately.</li>
				 <li>Apple Inc. issue a statement reaffirming their commitment to end-to-end encryption and to user privacy.</li>
			 </ol>
			 <p>
				 Apple&#39;s current path threatens to undermine decades of work by technologists, academics and policy advocates towards strong privacy-preserving measures being the norm across a majority of consumer electronic devices and use cases. We ask that Apple reconsider its technology rollout, lest it undo that important work.

      <title>The Cold War Fashion Showdown</title>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The Russians may have been winning the space race in the 1950s, but they couldn’t hold a candle to the sophistication of Western dress.</p><figure><figcaption>In the summer of 1959, the Cold War moved from the fields of science and technology to that of cultural exchange. </figcaption></figure><p>By the late 1950s, having <a href="https://www.space.com/17563-sputnik.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fired the first shot</a> in the space war, Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev extended the competition with the West to everyday culture and lifestyle. Thus, in the summer of 1959 the Cold War moved to the ﬁeld of cultural exchange. The Soviets organized an exhibition of their scientiﬁc, technological, and cultural achievements in New York, and the Americans followed with their own national exhibition in Moscow. Both Russians and Americans tried to show off their best clothes on each occasion. The official repositioning of the phenomenon of fashion in socialism therefore took place within the context of a ﬁght for cultural supremacy.</p><p>American vice president Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat, traveled to Moscow to open the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Fifty_Years_Ago_American_Exhibition_Stunned_Soviets_in_Cold_War/1783913.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American National Exhibition</a>. Before their visit, Pat Nixon carefully chose a new wardrobe, as reported in Newsweek:</p><blockquote><p>One suit of natural raw silk, a brown silk taffeta cocktail dress, a silk and cotton ﬂowered print dress with jacket and two other dresses. Most of her clothes were bought at Henry Bendel’s in New York where Pat spent an hour—and several hundred dollars. “They are costumes,” she explained. “Mostly full-skirted dresses with matching accessories to make a ‘picture.’ They are not high fashion and they’re the sort of thing I like, and which I think looks best on me.”</p></blockquote><p>At the opening of the exhibition, in the company of her husband and the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov, Pat Nixon glowed in her natural raw silk suit and smart hat. She looked just as she was supposed to: like a sophisticated and well-heeled American housewife. The message was clear: the Russians might be ahead in space research and education, but they cannot match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady going about her everyday life.</p><p>Pat Nixon’s carefully chosen wardrobe revealed a lifestyle with which the Russians could not compete. This lifestyle was even recited by IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAMAC</a>, the first commercial computer, present at the exhibition, which provided four thousand answers about different aspects of life in America. One of them offered information in perfect Russian about the wardrobe of an average American woman. She owned: <em>“Winter coat, spring coat, raincoat, ﬁve house dresses, four afternoon ‘dressy’ dresses, three suits, three skirts, six blouses, two petticoats, ﬁve nightgowns, eight panties, ﬁve brassières, two corsets, two robes, six pairs of nylon stockings, two pairs of sports socks, three pairs of dress gloves, three pairs of play shorts, one pair of slacks, one play suit, and accessories.”</em></p><p>During the exhibition, American fashion was presented at four thirty-ﬁve-minute-long fashion shows that took place each day, each of them attended by three thousand to ﬁve thousand Russians. The Soviet authorities had opposed many of the American proposals for the exhibition, but eventually the Russian audiences got a chance to enjoy the American fashion shows, which consisted of youthful clothes, leisure wear, daily ensembles, and formal long evening dresses.</p><p>Attempting to bring the Russians “a living slice of America,” the outﬁts were presented by professional models as well as children, teenagers, grandparents, and whole families. Newsweek described the fashion show as boring, but acknowledged the political meaning behind the clothes: “The dresses were all right, though a bit on the dull side,” they reported. “The whole idea behind it was to show the people of the Soviet Union how the average American woman dresses at work and at play — not the glamorous girl on Park Avenue, but the young matron on Main Street.” The choice of everyday mass-produced American clothes was very powerful propaganda. If sophisticated outﬁts from New York fashion salons had been shown, they could easily have been attacked as elitist clothes meant for the exploiting class. But the Americans knew only too well that the Russians could not compete in the ﬁeld of decent mass-produced clothing.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” reported the New York Times.</p></blockquote></figure><p>While fashion contributed to the huge propaganda effect that the American National Exhibition had in Moscow, the American media commented on the shortcomings in the culture of everyday Soviet life at the Russian exchange exhibition that had taken place only two months earlier in the New York Coliseum. “The Soviet exhibition strives for an image of abundance with an apartment that few Russians enjoy,” <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/30/80589100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported</a> the New York Times, “with clothes and furs that are rarely seen on Moscow streets.” The fashion show that was included in the exhibition drew ironic comments from Western journalists. Five female models and one male model displayed designs by Soviet fashion designers from the leading Moscow department store GUM and the <em>Dom modelei, </em>or House of Prototypes, an institution created by Stalin to produce prototypes for socialist fashion. Time magazine reported that “the textiles, mostly thick, heavy-textured woolen suits, are more impressive for their usefulness against the Russian winter than for their styles, which are clumsy attempts to copy western designs.”</p><p>Though the American media declared GUM’s outﬁts “clumsy copies,” they were actually the most prestigious representations of Soviet-style elegance. In 1956, GUM’s general director, V. G. Kamenov, wrote a booklet describing in detail the services that the Soviet ﬂagship department store offered. Fashion ateliers for custom-made clothes and special shops selling natural silk, artistically hand-painted silk, women’s hats, fur coats, and perfumes were supposed to present an idea of abundance and sophistication. In the illustrations accompanying the text, attentive sales personnel were shown offering customers these traditionally luxurious goods. One section of the booklet dealt with new sales techniques, while another praised the fashion salons within the store, which offered individual service in sumptuous surroundings.</p><p>The store’s interior, ﬁlled with dark carved wooden furniture, crystal chandeliers, and heavy velvet curtains, was similar to the Stalinist concept of palaces of consumption of the 1930s. The store continued an outdated, grandiose aesthetics that promoted the mythical Stalinist concept of luxury. But this Stalinist gloriﬁcation of reality, which tried to remove all conﬂicting and erratic elements from everyday life, could not compete with ordinary life in the West. Thus, with the opening of the Soviet Union toward the West, the disjunction between the deprivation of everyday life and its ideal representation became blatantly obvious.</p><div><figure><figcaption>The fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Pictured in this 1959 cover of Life magazine: Pat Nixon with her Soviet counterparts: (from left) Mrs. Mikoian, Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Khrushcheva, and Mrs. Kozlova.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the late 1950s, in comparison with the efficiency of the large American department stores and the diversity and quality of the mass-produced goods that they offered, GUM had become outdated and provincial, as direct contacts with the West painfully revealed. The cover of Life magazine from August 1959 showed that the fashion war was taking place even at the highest diplomatic level. Flanked by Mrs. Mikoian (on her left), Nina Khrushcheva (right), and Mrs. Kozlova (far right), Pat Nixon appeared as a smartly dressed upper-class American housewife. The Life magazine cover was a visual testament to the Soviet diplomats’ wives’ inability to match the sophisticated, worldly style of Pat Nixon in her silk, ﬂower-printed dress, a string of pearls, and carefully applied makeup, as well as her svelte ﬁgure. Accompanying their husbands, the ladies attended a dinner table conference at Khrushchev’s <em>dacha</em>, or country house.</p><p>There were signiﬁcant visual differences among the three Soviet politicians’ wives, which pointed to their different levels of sartorial awareness. Nina Khrushcheva was clad in the simplest dress, which buttoned at the front. Called <em>khalat</em>, this style had become a domestic uniform of Soviet women. Women wore <em>khalat</em> at home, whether going about their domestic work, cooking, resting, or entertaining. Mrs. Mikoian was dressed in a sartorially more demanding outﬁt: a suit, with a cut that discreetly shaped the body. Her suit was modest, but its proletarian asceticism was softened with a little hat. That fashion detail showed a certain investment in her look, transforming her simple suit into an outdoor outﬁt.</p><p>The formal outﬁt worn by the wife of the Soviet deputy prime minister Frol Kozlov showed a full awareness of the importance of the occasion. Mrs. Kozlova’s evening gown, embellished with embroidery around the neckline, as well as her embroidered muslin stole, her white evening handbag, her white gloves, her hairstyle and makeup showed a new attitude toward fashionable dress. But Mrs. Kozlova could not yet match the sophistication of Western dress and the easy smoothness of an American lady of the same social standing. The ideologically informed rejection of fashion’s history was imprinted on Mrs. Kozlova’s dress even more so than on Mrs. Mikoian’s simple suit or Nina Khrushcheva’s symbolically burdened housedress.</p><p>Mrs. Kozlova’s appearance not only acknowledged contemporary formal Western dress, but it broke an important socialist dress code. The most important members of the political bureaucracy or nomenklatura had always dressed modestly in public, a practice that had started with the Bolsheviks. Stalin and his political circle had also stuck to the proletarian ideal of modesty in their public looks, although their private lives had been loaded with all the symbols of traditional luxury, from fur coats to house help, antique furniture, and ﬁne food. The Old Bolshevik wives Nina Khrushcheva and Mrs. Mikoian respected the longstanding nomenklatura dress code. Recognizing that times were changing, Mrs. Kozlova, however, dared to transgress it.</p><hr/><p><em>Djurdja Bartlett is Reader in Histories and Cultures of Fashion at the London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London, and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/FashionEast-Spectre-Haunted-Socialism-Press/dp/0262026503" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FashionEast: The Spectre that Haunted Socialism</a>.</em>“</p></article></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <div>
      <p>Today, Acting Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine sent the following letter to Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook’s misleading claims regarding the company’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook">consent decree with the FTC</a>:</p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: </span></p>

<p><span>I write concerning Facebook’s recent insinuation that its actions against an academic research project conducted by NYU’s Ad Observatory were required by the company’s consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. As the company has since acknowledged, this is inaccurate. The FTC is committed to protecting the privacy of <em>people</em>, and efforts to shield targeted advertising practices from scrutiny run counter to that mission.</span></p>

<p><span>While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter. Only last week, Facebook’s General Counsel, Jennifer Newstead, committed the company to “timely, transparent communication to BCP staff about significant developments.” Yet the FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.</span></p>

<p><span>Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest. Indeed, the FTC supports efforts to shed light on opaque business practices, especially around surveillance-based advertising. While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy – much less the FTC consent order – as a pretext to advance other aims. </span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely, </span></p>

<p><em><span>/s/ Samuel Levine </span></em></p>

<p><span>Acting Director</span></p>

<p>I am <s>broke</s> “non-liquid” right now. Normally, that sentence doesn’t have geopolitical ramifications on the creation of hybrid private-public surveillance state. But in my case it does.</p>



<p>It started rather innocuously. Someone couldn’t send me money. No matter what they did. They couldn’t transfer any money. Curious. We started experimenting with different friends, companies, and acquaintances. None of them could send me money. <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> wouldn’t provide any explanation. My business had been a paying customer for more than ~4+ years. And now, I was locked out. Okay. They’re hardly the only fish in the sea.</p>



<p>Except it happened again. This time with our bank, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>†. Okay, that’s strange. They asked for more details. We sent them details. Scans of my documentation. They’d revert back a few days later for more details. And we’d send it to them again. On and on we went chasing each other around the maypole. A few weeks passed, and Mercury’s team finally cut to the chase, they asked if I was affiliated with Entity X. We said no. But it didn’t matter. They froze me out anyway.</p>



<p>In some ways, we’re lucky that they flagged the transfer, because they gave us the first clue of what was going on. A friend ended up having the insight to search for Entity X (thanks Nick!) and found that <em>they’d been sanctioned</em>. Okay. What did this have to do with me?</p>



<p>On further investigation, we found that I shared my legal name with someone working with Entity X. Great. It’s a common name, like Robert Brown or Mary Johnson. Shouldn’t it be easy to prove that I’m not person X? A little Googling later, I found that the United States Department of the Treasury has an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and they have an email address for “reconsideration” if you’ve been mistakenly placed on the sanctions list. As I’m clearly not the person they were looking to sanction, I decided that the most logical course of action would be write to them, and get their assent that I am indeed not the human that they’re looking for.</p>



<p>We wrote something up (once again, thanks Nick). And we sent it in.</p>



<p>The OFAC replied, to their credit, quite promptly with a link for false positives, and they told me to send this to the bank. Okay. Done. Except, it didn’t matter. Mercury blocked me anyway. The saga finished with me getting nada.</p>



<p>I wrote back to the OFAC requesting them to write something, anything on an official looking letterhead stating the simple fact that I, Person X born on such and such date with an ID number of Z, am not the person who has been sanctioned. I offered to provide them with additional details if there was any hesitancy on their part.</p>



<p>They haven’t replied. And I still can’t get any cash.</p>



<p>What’s amazing about this saga is that I have a statistically common legal name. There are thousands of people running around with this name. And effectively, they’ve <em>all</em> been barred from the global financial system.</p>



<p>To their credit, the OFAC publishes additional details for each person to prevent this exact scenario from occurring. However, these details seem to vary across individuals and countries. It doesn’t seem to be a neat dataset to model. In fact, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists" target="_blank">the lists are available online in .PDF and .TXT files,</a> and it’s a mess. Also, there isn’t one list, but rather multiple lists, with different details. As far as I can tell, there is no <em>official</em> API. There is no efficient way for programmers designing, say a “[bank] built for startups” to comply with the Treasury. Consequently, someone decided, in a meeting room somewhere, to punt the problem.</p>



<p>If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just run a simple match against the name – the one element of the dataset guaranteed to be there – and then punt it to our underpaid and understaffed KYC department to deal with? And the KYC department punted it to legal. And legal took one look and went, “hrm, what’s our downside risk if we approve this? Do we know this person is indeed the one being sanctioned? Oh, I see. Well let’s just block them. There’s not much they can do about it.”</p>



<p>And so, I am currently <s>broke</s> non-liquid. Kafka would have been proud.</p>



<p><em>(for connoisseurs of dark humor, I find it particularly hilarious that more likely than not the person they’re targeting will never be affected by this. This person, with whom I have the misfortune of sharing a legal name, doesn’t seem to perform many international transactions. She lives in a cash-first developing country, where the sanctions have no reach. She’s but a lowly piece in a very big game)</em></p>



<hr/>



<p>In other news, Apple has decided to scan images on your phone. For child porn, of course. There aren’t enough people (nor PR capital) to look through all of your photos. So, they’ve done the efficient thing instead. They’re simply going to match all of your photos, on your phone, against a hash of child porn images. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">Other, more eloquent commentators,</a> have pointed out the danger this poses. Apple often bends over for authoritarian regimes like China, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/technology/apple-hong-kong-app.html">remove apps that help pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong avoid police violence</a>. Or, that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned">the company doesn’t allow adults to view adult content on the devices that they own</a>. Or, in more conservative countries, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avng9/apple-is-letting-over-150-countries-censor-lgbtq-content-in-the-app-store">removing any apps that mention the inconvenient existence of LGBTQ+ people</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">Wikipedia has an exhaustive list.</a></p>



<p>However, it is not my purpose to repeat what these commentators have already said. Nor to write a polemic for its own sake. My goal is to use my experience to peer into the future. To predict, through inevitability, the chain of events for poor souls in days yet to pass.</p>



<p>Just like the programmers who chose to match names against the sanctions list, while the KYC and legal departments handle the rest, Apple is matching all of the private photos on your phone against a list. This list is generated using something called a hash function. It turns an image into a number that a computer can then use to make the comparison. The process looks a bit like this, </p>







<p>Please note this is an example from a lovely blog that goes through this process. Apple’s process is different, but inherently similar.</p>



<p>In most cases, when we’re dealing with hashes in computer science, we’re looking for exact matches. But this case is different. Criminals aren’t stupid. They’re often not clever, but not all of them are stupid. What if they add a filter? Or, change the image somehow? Maybe add in a blur? What then?</p>



<p>Well, clearly, they can’t make every variation possible of every image that the police are looking for. If it’s a pain to code this thing and it seems like a box to tick, then why not just look for <em>similarity</em> instead and then punt it to law enforcement to deal with? To put it another way, the question Apple is asking isn’t, “is this image exactly like this photo from the child porn database?” No, the question Apple is asking is, “is this image similar to this photo from the child porn database?” Where the “similar” question is answered by a very clever, but very dumb algorithm.</p>



<p>In my case, when the programmers punted to the KYC department and legal, a bunch of transactions were cancelled. In this case, the police will raid your house and arrest you for “child porn.”</p>



<p>The image they will raid you for wouldn’t even necessarily have to be an adult one. Computers are strange. They are very literal beings. They do <em>exactly</em> what they are told, which is both their greatest asset and weakness. For example, this neural network thinks that this cat is guacamole,</p>







<p>Apple’s algorithm is <em>very different</em>, but it is susceptible to the same problems. In this case, noise was added into the image to make the neural network classify the cat as guacamole. In your case, it could be just happenstance. Random noise due to lighting conditions that takes an innocent photo (or, more likely, an intimate photo of you or your partner) and makes the algorithm assume that it is <em>similar</em> to a restricted photo.</p>



<p>Just like me, one day you’ll wake up and notice that something weird might be going on. Maybe it’s a car parked outside your street. Maybe it’s a feeling like people are following you. You won’t be that alarmed at first. You’ll dismiss it. But, eventually, it will come crashing in. Your door will be knocked open by SWAT. And you will find yourself facing armored people in guns to your confusion. They’ll scream for you to raise your hands and put them behind your head. They’ll say, “ma’am we have a warrant for your arrest.” And confused, you’ll be walked out to a waiting squad car.</p>



<p>Your local newspaper will write, “[You] has been arrested for possessing child pornography.” But you won’t read the headline. You’ll be in an interrogation room. Waiting for them to come in. Maybe the officer is letting you sweat it out. Maybe not. But eventually they’ll come in and they’ll start interrogating you. “Ma’am do you consume pornography that has minors in it?”</p>



<p>And you’ll deny it. They’ll put your phone in front of you. It’ll be in one of those bags. You’ll unlock it for them. And you’ll know that they’re going to go through everything. Including that embarrassing pic you took for K.</p>



<p>They won’t find anything. So they’ll return to question you. Maybe you’ve deleted the photos, who knows? Let’s pass it on to forensics and see what they come up with.</p>



<p>Eventually, you’ll end up being detained in jail. Your bail will be set high. You’ll have to plead and explain to everyone around you that you don’t know what’s happening. You don’t know why this happened. And those near you might believe you, but there will be this doubt that crosses through their mind. Just for a second. They’ll have this doubt, and that doubt will always be there for the rest of their life.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough to have money, you’ll get a lawyer. They’ll work on getting you out. Eventually, the forensics will return nothing. Your lawyer will succeed in getting you to walk free. And you’ll walk back to your home, with stares from your neighbors.</p>



<p>In a few months, it’ll come out that no, Apple’s algorithm screwed up here. Apple will blame law enforcement. Law enforcement will blame Apple. It doesn’t matter. That newspaper will put up a small story on their site about how you’re really innocent. It won’t get many clicks. And the one about you getting arrested for possessing child porn will stay up forever. With a note added to it, if you’re lucky.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll get your life back. Maybe not. But you’ll spend the rest of your life under this cloud, because some programmer somewhere wrote this code. And everyone else assumed that it just works.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://rss.markdessain.com/feeds/hackernews/https___www_bhphotovideo_com_explora_photography_hands-on-review_classic-cameras-my-dads-argus-c3/image.jpg" /> 
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For as long as I can remember, the heavy chunk of black Bakelite and chrome nicknamed “The Brick,” was a staple on a shelf in my parents’ living room. Officially known as the Argus C3, this solid pointy-edged rangefinder is said to be one of the most popular cameras in history, selling about 2 million units during its extraordinary 27-year production run, from 1939 to 1966.</p>
<p>While this camera belonged to my father, I have little memory of him using it, and even less of a sense for when and how he acquired it, or which images were made with the Argus when sifting through many decades of disorganized family snapshots squirreled away in cardboard boxes at home.</p>
<p>By the time I was in grade school, my father had largely abandoned the dials and knobs of this stately machine for the automatic exposure controls of a Kodak Brownie Auto 27. And while it’s easy to distinguish the square-format prints that Kodak generated from the mountain of other memories that make up our family picture collection, determining which of the earlier pictures were made with the Argus is indeed a mystery.</p>
<h3>The American Leica</h3>
<p>The company behind the Argus C3 was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Charles A. Verschoor, in 1931. Initially a radio manufacturer, an early product, the Kadette, was the first mass-produced AC/DC radio, using tubes instead of a large transformer. Although successful, radio sales were highly seasonal in the days before air conditioning, dropping off in summer months as people abandoned indoor entertainment for outdoor pursuits. To keep his factory and salesmen working all year, Verschoor searched for a product that could be cheaply manufactured and sold during the warmer half of the year.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/01-argus_c3_dsc4576_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>My father’s Argus C3, affectionately known as “the Brick.”</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>He was impressed by the early 35mm Leica cameras he saw during a business trip to Germany, and came up with a plan to adopt the same Bakelite molding technology used for radio casings, to make an affordable camera that would be similar to the Leica. From its debut in early 1936, Verschoor’s initial model A camera was a huge success, prompting him to name his new product line Argus, from the Greek mythological god of 1,000 eyes.</p>
<p>Designed and patented by Gustave Fassin, in 1938, the first Argus C model cameras were uncoupled rangefinders, which required the user to manually rotate the lens barrel to match the rangefinder reading. An upgraded model, the Argus C2, provided a coupled rangefinder, and in 1939 the Argus C3 added built-in flash synchronization via an accessory flash gun.</p>
<h3>Determining Provenance</h3>
<p>Turning back to my treasure trove of photos, I found some handwritten notes on the back of certain dog-eared prints indicating that my father had a camera in his possession during World War II. Could he have purchased the Argus C3 shortly after its release, before shipping out to basic training as a 20-year-old, and then on to the Canal Zone, and Europe? Whatever camera he had, it was certainly a model with a bulb setting—which the Argus C3 possessed—based on all the forerunners to selfie culture I found among his prints, along with a note scribbled on the back of a picture of him reclining in his bunk, describing his shooting process.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Four images of my father at Albrook Field, Canal Zone, made with a camera he owned during World War II. While he may have had help with the first three portraits, he wrote that he used the bulb setting on the back of the last print. It took me a lot of sleuthing to discover what camera he used for these pictures. Read through to the end to find out.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The extreme popularity of the Argus C3 has made it a cult classic, even though the company ceased production of this model in 1966. Turning to the Internet, I soon found a website that allows Argus owners to estimate a camera’s manufacturing date based on the camera’s serial number. If that data is accurate, my father’s camera was likely made in 1951, an ownership date that seems more plausible, as my father would have then been 32 years old, and in the process of building our house. Indeed, I have a vivid memory of a collection of spiral-bound albums showing every step of the construction process. Although these albums have since been disassembled, a large pile of surviving prints offers evidence that he was playing with a new toy while climbing scaffolding and driving nails.</p>
<p>According to some accounts, the public was captivated by the camera’s scientific appearance, with all its shiny metal dials and knobs on the front, along the top, and on the bottom. As a former airplane mechanic, and a newly minted electrician, and having the budding reputation as “mister fix-it,” it’s not hard to imagine my dad being drawn to what at the time was a powerful mix of deluxe features and affordable cost.</p>
<h3>Operating the Camera</h3>
<p>While the C3’s brick-like body has little in common with modern ergonomics, there is something satisfying about the weight of this camera in the hands. Looking down at the jet-black top surface, metal dials at left and right control the shutter release and film winding, while a rudimentary frame counter sits squarely on top, backed by a small hexagonal film catch. The shutter button has two settings—B for bulb and I for Instantaneous—marked on its chrome skirt, and the top of the button is threaded for the addition of a cable release.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the shutter release, the metal teeth of the rangefinder gear protrude from the top along the camera’s front edge, allowing the user to turn the rangefinder dial with their shutter finger, which engages the idler gear to focus the lens.</p>

</div><figcaption>Six images of my parents’ home in various stages of construction. The year was 1952-53, and I’m certain he was using the Argus C3. Since the negatives have long since vanished, these images were scanned from 2x3&#34; prints.</figcaption></figure><p>To the right of the rangefinder dial, two rectangular windows are home to separate finders: the viewfinder, which is used to compose a picture, and the rangefinder, which is used to focus with the aid of a split image. As you turn the rangefinder dial the two halves of the image move into or out of register, with the bottom half of the finder window tinted yellow as a visual aid. When the top and bottom halves line up at your desired focal point, your subject will be in focus. Alternatively, you can zone focus by turning the lens itself and estimating the subject-to-lens distance from the rangefinder dial.</p>
<p>A shutter speed dial in the upper right front corner controls the length of time the shutter will be open to light, with different versions of the camera offering a range of five, seven, or ten different speeds between 1/10 to 1/300 second.</p>
<p>Tying all these elements together is the camera lens, which is interchangeable due to the placement of the three-leaf shutter inside the camera body itself, not between the lens elements. A screw mount lens plate above the shutter mechanism accepts three different lenses, the default being a 50mm f/3.5 anastigmat triplet lens, the Argus Coated Cintar. My father also owned the 100mm f/4.5 Tele-Sandmar, made by Enna Werk, in Germany, while a C3 wide-angle lens also offered a 35mm f/4.5 focal length, ideal for group shots and working in tight spaces.</p>
<h3>Calibrating the Lens for Proper Rangefinder Focusing</h3>
<p>Since the lens is coupled to the rangefinder dial, to ensure proper focus it’s essential to carefully follow outlined steps when removing or replacing different lenses. When running my first roll of film through the camera, I overlooked these instructions, and the film ended up completely blurred. The text below is taken from the Argus C3 instruction manual, which proved to be all I needed for acceptable image sharpness. Yet, if that doesn’t work, more advanced instructions about correcting the rangefinder settings by removing a small circular dial on top of the camera can be found online.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/12-argus_c3_dsc4580_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Top view of the Argus C3. The small metal disk midway between the counter dial and film advance is the Rangefinder cover, which can be removed to fine tune both horizontal and vertical focus adjustments.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><em>To remove lens: Set the Rangefinder dial to the 3-foot mark, then unscrew the Idler Gear cap and lift out the gear, before unscrewing the lens by turning to the left.</em></p>
<p><em>To replace lens: Screw it back into the camera by turning to the right, past the resistance point until it is seated firmly. Then turn the lens back towards the left until a wide range of gear teeth are opposite the Idler Gear shaft. </em></p>
<p><em>Drop the Idler Gear into place on its metal post, and then turn the lens back to the right as far as it will go. This will position the lens at the infinity mark. Remove the Idler Gear, being careful not to disturb the lens position. Set the rangefinder dial exactly to infinity by turning it to the right and replace the Idler Gear without disturbing the positions of the lens or the Rangefinder dial.</em></p>
<p><em>Set the Rangefinder dial at the 3-foot mark, and screw on the Idler Gear cap. The camera is now ready for pictures!</em></p>
<h3>Running Film</h3>
<p>My father’s camera offers a purely analog shooting experience, with neither a battery or light meter to rein you in (although a later version, the Argus C3 Matchmatic, did boast an exposure meter on top). While it is feasible to use the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/sunny-16-rule">Sunny 16 Rule</a> as an exposure guide, I opted to use the meter in my miniscule Sony RX100 V as a digital chimp sheet of sorts, to speed the shooting process.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/13-argus_c3_dsc4575_72_dpi.jpg" rel="a nofollow"></a><figcaption>Interior view of the Argus C3, showing the camera’s three-blade shutter and film advance mechanisms. The two circular windows along the top are for the viewfinder (<em>left</em>) and rangefinder (<em>right</em>).</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Film is easily loaded into the camera by depressing the side latch and swinging open the back door, securing the film canister against the prong of the rewind knob, and threading the end of the film through a slot in the take up spindle at the other end. This method of loading film was much easier than Leica’s removable bottom panel design, which no doubt contributed to the Argus’s popularity during that era, in addition to its lower cost.</p>
<p>On top of the camera, the film advance knob is clearly marked with an arrow and the word wind, but to initiate a photo one must first activate the shutter cocking lever on the front. The rudimentary nature of using separate functions for cocking the shutter and advancing the film, combined with the complexity of rangefinder focusing, and the guesswork of proper exposure calculations, makes for a plodding, multi-step process, which can be a haven for error.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>The graphic lines and dimensionality of this steel globe was perfect for testing the C3’s focus and depth of field. What I didn’t factor in was a double exposure that resulted from a lapse of attention as I moved too quickly between shots. Despite the chaotic mash-up of lines and reflections in that image, I rather like it.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>One of the easiest and most prevalent mistakes to make occurs when the user exposes a picture but forgets to advance the film before cocking the shutter and shooting a second frame, thereby double-exposing. When not caused by a moment of forgetfulness, double exposure has great potential for creative expression, and arguments can even be made for the validity of double exposures caused by chance. However, when shooting with this camera, it’s advisable to adopt the concentration and presence of mind generally associated with large format analog photography, for best results.</p>
<p>Therefore, immediately after tripping the shutter, direct your attention to the black numbered film counter, and more specifically to the hexagonal metal tab—otherwise known as the film catch—at the back of the counter. To advance the film, begin winding the advance knob while pressing the film catch, and release the catch after a quarter turn. Then continue winding until the point of resistance, which means that you’ve arrived at the next frame. Repeat the process as you watch the film counter advance from one hash mark to the next. Once you encounter continuous resistance when trying to advance the film you’ve arrived at the end of the roll.</p>
<p>To rewind, simply turn the knurled winding knob at the bottom of the camera in the direction of the arrow using slow gentle pressure. In my experience, film sprockets are prone to tearing during the rewinding process, so it may be advisable to have a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=film%20changing%20bag&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=">film changing bag</a> handy in case you need to extract the film by opening the camera before it’s completely back in its case.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts on Use</h3>
<p>Considering the vagaries of framing pictures through the C3’s tiny, well-worn viewfinder, and ascertaining sharpness through a rangefinder that sometimes seems to function more like a Kaleidoscope, I was pleasantly surprised with some of my pictures. To be clear, this would not be an enjoyable tool for any photographer seeking precision or ease of use, yet as I began to settle into the process, I began to have fun exploring the camera’s limits, using a roll of <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/24624-REG/Ilford_1748192_Delta_400_Professional_135_36_Black.html">Ilford Delta 400 black-and-white film</a>.</p>

It was a bright sunny day, but the trees cast dappled sunlight, allowing me to open my 50mm f/3.5 Argus Coated Cintar lens to a wide aperture. After toying with the rangefinder focus in an overview shot, I decided to test its 3-foot minimum focal length in a close-up. At that distance, it’s much easier to adjust focus by moving the camera itself until the two halves of the rangefinder match up in the desired spot, rather than turning the rangefinder gear.</p>
<p>Once I had explored photo options in the park for a while, I made my way to Fifth Avenue and began photographing some of the stately monuments on my way to Rockefeller Center. Discovering the Atlas statue adorned with fresh flowers, I studied the monument from all sides to look for interesting angles. The midafternoon sun was beating down from the southwest, creating a strong backlight effect that I knew would be a great test for lens flare. Although the glare made it barely possible to focus or frame the shot below at right, the lens captured a much better picture than I had anticipated, with just a thin veil of flare along the bottom part of the image.</p>
<div><figure><div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/19-jill_argus_c3015.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/tsc/20-jill_argus_c3017.jpg" title="" rel="f"></a></p></div></div><figcaption>The C3’s rangefinder focus held true.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The images I shot were hand-developed using <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/213174-REG/Ilford_1960457_ID_11_Film_Developer.html">Ilford ID 11</a> at a dilution of 1:3 for 18 minutes. All the pictures in this story (prints and negatives) were scanned on an <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/647187-REG/Epson_B11B198011_Perfection_V600_Photo_Scanner.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">Epson Perfection V600 Photo Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>And, about the camera my father used during World War II. After much searching, I discovered an old picture album full of prints he had made during this period. While flipping through the pages, I happened upon a folded piece of white paper, which I opened to find an official note from his Commanding Officer, dated August 7, 1941, authorizing him to own a camera, which at that time was an Argus Model A, serial # 199578. Sadly, I have no idea where that camera is today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section role="main"><section><section><div id="post__wrapper-90660570"><div><div><div data-id="90660570" data-slug="the-smart-home-is-flailing-as-a-concept-because-it-sucks"><div><div><article><p>A couple of weeks ago, the tech industry group Consumer Technology Association (CTA) released a predictably cheery report on the state of consumer technology. It forecasted record-breaking revenues of $487 billion this year, with laptops, wireless earbuds, personal fitness devices, and 5G phones singled out for especially strong growth.</p><div><p>Yet tucked into that upbeat forecast was a spot of dreariness: Smart home devices, once <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/why-2017-will-finally-be-the-year-of-the-smart-home-consumers-figure-it-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hailed</a> as tech’s <a href="https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/how-and-why-the-tech-giants-are-fighting-for-the-home-platform-811f5b6174e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big computing platform</a>, would experience flat revenues of $15 billion in 2021, with unit sales up 11%.</p><p>The CTA says its stagnant forecast is merely a function of competition, as an influx of device makers drive down the cost of hardware. But as someone who’s been living with various smart home gadgets for several years now, I have a different theory: They’re just not worth a big investment unless you have a limitless supply of time and patience.</p><h2>An airing of grievances</h2><p>When you press a button on your phone—say, to make a phone call or take a photo—you probably expect that button to work every time. But that’s not the way things work with smart home devices.</p></div><div><p>Just this week, for instance, the two Alexa-connected blinds in my bedroom failed to roll down at their scheduled time, and this morning, only one of them opened back up again. I have no idea what went wrong, because Alexa doesn’t offer any feedback when things fail, so all I could do was try again until the routine triggered properly.</p><p>Those kinds of misfires are common in the smart home world. I’ve had Google Assistant refuse to set alarms or read upcoming calendar events for several days in a row, only to fix itself without explanation. My Ecobee thermostat occasionally gets stuck on a single temperature, requiring a reboot. I’ve had light bulbs inexplicably fail to connect to their hub device. And I’m pretty confident that every Echo speaker owner has experienced Alexa playing the wrong music at least once.</p><p>The problem, says Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, is that smart home devices haven’t gotten much better at avoiding these problems even as the market edges toward mainstream users. Instead, a proliferation of new devices and use cases has multiplied the ways in which things to go wrong.</p></div><div><p>“At the beginning, you obviously had early adopters who usually have a higher level of patience,” she says. “But now that the market is somewhat mature, you’re not going to stand for that. You’re not going to be happy if you can’t rely on it. If your alarm doesn’t go off, there are consequences.”</p><h2>Too many choices</h2><p>Making sense of what to buy in the first place also brings its own challenges. Chaos reigns at every step in the smart home purchase process, and you can easily end up with a pile of devices that don’t work together. The SmartThings lights in my bedroom don’t work with Apple’s Siri assistant, and my Tilt blinds only work with Alexa. To control my Liftmaster garage door opener by voice, I must first connect it through a third-party service called <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFTTT</a>. The Philips Wiz smart bulb outside my office don’t work with Apple’s HomeKit system (though Philips’s separate Hue lighting brand does).</p><p>Even the relatively simple act of playing music across multiple smart speakers involves a mess of proprietary protocols. The Sonos Beam soundbar responds to voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa, but only supports multi-room audio with other Sonos or Apple AirPlay speakers. To connect my soundbar with Google Home or Echo devices in other rooms, I’d have to plug a Chromecast or Fire TV (or both) into my television first.</p></div><div><p>A couple weeks ago, I also lost control of my SmartThings light bulbs entirely. That’s because Samsung decided to stop supporting a product it launched three years ago for <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/3239730/samsung-smartthings-link-for-nvidia-shield-tv-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming box into a SmartThings device hub</a>. I’ve yet to set up the replacement hub that Samsung offered at a discount, because it requires pairing every bulb all over again. (Owners of Wink smart home hubs went through a similar ordeal last year, when that company switched to a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/wink-delays-subscription-service-one-week-in-response-to-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mandatory subscription model</a>.)</p><p>When I explain this temporary inconvenience to my wife, she rightfully rolls her eyes. While she’s been a good sport about my smart home endeavors, she’s also keenly aware of how annoying they can be.

The inherent wonkiness of our current setup has permanently dissuaded her from entire categories of devices—most notably, smart door locks—and we’ve mutually decided against installing security cameras of any kind.

He points to robots as a big area of potential growth, with the industry moving beyond basic vacuums and into floor washers and lawn mowers.</p><p>“Over time, as people continue to improve their homes, they’ll see opportunities to upgrade to connected devices and build out their home network,” Kowalski says.</p><div id="pullquote--90660570"><blockquote><p>Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own.</p></blockquote></div><p>He’s probably right, in the sense that people will slowly amass patchworks of gadgets in the same way that I have over the past few years. But the original promise of the smart home wasn’t merely about automating a handful of random tasks. Companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google were instead supposed to provide a kind of central intelligence for the home, tying together an array of devices in clever and delightful ways. The idea is that a smart alarm clock would know to open your blinds and turn on the lights in the morning, or that your sleep tracker would know to turn the thermostat down when you’re not resting comfortably.</p></div><div><p>Today, those companies are still figuring out exactly how to do all that. Google Assistant is still trying to replace features that Google’s Nest devices once offered on their own, such as Home- and Away-based automation routines. Apple still has two separate interfaces for home automation—one through its Home app, and another through Shortcuts. Amazon still maintains three separate smart home systems through Alexa, Ring, and Blink. Only recently have all three tech giants agreed on a <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single wireless smart home protocol</a>, which would reduce the number of bridges and hubs people have to install.</p><p>It’s all just so hopelessly confusing right now, and it’s probably not going to get better anytime soon.</p><p>“People continue to buy thermostats and locks and lights, but I don’t know that we’ve moved the industry forward from an experience perspective,” Milanesi says. “It’s not actually that smart.”</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></section></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <div>
    <p>A few people have asked me lately what makes for a good podcast.  Since my podcast is far from the most popular, and since most podcasts are not like mine, and do not (and should not) try to be like mine, perhaps I am not the right respondent.  Nonetheless I offered a simple formula:</p>
<p><em>A podcast really works when it is the dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>Or expressed in other words:</p>
<p><em>What makes for a good podcast is the dramatic tension between the guest and host</em>.</p>
<p>If you think of Russ Roberts at EconTalk, often “the story line” is something like “I am a Mensch and you are a Mensch, and we are going to talk this through together.”  In earlier times, it had more elements of “you are going to put forward some mainstream points, and I am going to push back with market-oriented economics.”</p>
<p>Many of the most famous podcasts are variants of: “We will pretend to be talking about something, but in fact we will exploring new visions of masculinity for a Woke and post-Woke world.”</p>
<p>The visual images and home pages associated with those podcasts are often so…manly.  The T-shirts!  The muscles!  It is also why those podcasts fail so badly at having significant numbers of interesting female guests, addressed on their own terms.</p>
<p>Many episodes of Conversations of Tyler are “I’m going to try to show people just how smart you are, but it will end up a wilder and more precarious ride than you might have thought.”  Occasionally a guest flunks the test (though they might still be smart).  Alternately, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/daniel-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the podcast with Daniel Carpenter</a> was the first episode of “Tyler gets upset at a guest, they really have at it!”</p>
<p>I called my podcast with David Deutsch “weird and testy” — that too is dramatic tension.  One listener <a href="https://twitter.com/jachaseyoung/status/1400254407191580672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>: “Tyler’s delight at having a guest who doesn’t hedge or mealymouth is palpable.”  Few tweeted about the substance of the disagreements.</p>
<p>One woman <a href="https://twitter.com/pupu_tintin/status/1400154143092789252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about it</a>: “Without understanding everything he said, I find myself mentally stimulated &amp; spiritually inspired. Such a purist, an idealist, a truth-seeker w/ religious zeal. Not religious myself, I could see myself eventually submit to his religion”</p>
<p>She meant Deutsch.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieRumbelow/status/1413829597918121985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some listeners</a> enjoy how the guests are surprised and delighted by the questions.  With <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alexander-the-grate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander the Grate</a> — the homeless guy — the question was how he would perform at all.  I thought he was excellent and very interesting, but there was real suspense leading up to that point.  “And will Tyler question him just like he does everyone else?”</p>
<p>Get the picture?  I’m not saying these listeners are indifferent to the content, rather they filter it through the unfolding story about the dialogical interaction.  I don’t know of any successful podcasts that violate this principle.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>…some very few podcasts are high level professionals in the same field, with a lot of respect for one another, exploring the space and enjoying each other’s company, especially when effectively “meeting for the first time.” I feel like this is maybe on the order of 1-5% of podcasts I hear. Most podcasts I listen to are “just” very high quality interviews</p></blockquote>
<p>My podcasts with Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss would be examples of that, and there are plenty more out there without yours truly.</p>
<p>So, to use <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansonian rhetoric,</a> “Podcasting isn’t about the podcast!”  If you are seeking to understanding a podcast, including your own, start by asking what the basic story line is.  Where the dramatic tension lies.  Do you have enough dramatic tension in what you are doing?  What is the actual reason why you are not attracting more quality guests of a particular kind?</p>
<p>I am not claiming comparable expertise, but to return to my own endeavors, they are most influenced by: Monty Python’s Flying Circus (especially the interview segments, which maintain remarkable dramatic tension), Seinfeld (wonderful ensemble work), Curb Your Enthusiasm (for how long can you keep people on edge?), and the TNT halftime show with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, etc. (what makes for a dramatic or memorable interjection?).  I doubt those are the right sources for <em>your</em> podcast, but perhaps you should look far and wide as well, rather than just listening to other podcasts.  Howard Stern is perhaps another useful source?</p>
<p>If they had had another season of Seinfeld, would Jerry have to have started (again) dating Elaine?  The dramatic stories in a podcast also need to change and evolve over time, and perhaps I will return to that topic in the future.</p>

                    <p>Worldwide, an estimated 20,000 species of wild and managed insects pollinate flowers, aiding plant reproduction<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.

</figure><p>Intensive agriculture is a multifactorial source of stress on pollinator populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Pollinating insects, such as bees, face the physiological challenge of acute or chronic harm from exposure to various agrochemicals, including fungicides and pesticides, that are used to protect crop plants. They also face nutritional stress arising from the lack of pollen- and nectar-providing wild flowers in large-scale, intensive crop monocultures<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>. Moreover, the industrial transport and use of managed high-density colonies of honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) for crop pollination can increase pollinator exposure to parasites or pathogens<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, and might result in disease spillover to wild pollinators<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>. Over the past decade, the lethal or sublethal effect of combinations of agrochemical, pathogenic or nutritional stressors on bees has been tested in many individual experiments<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter <i>et al</i>. advance this knowledge through a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of interactions between agrochemical, pathogenic and nutritional stressors on multiple aspects of bee health and fitness. Their analysis is notable because of the breadth of bee responses considered (for example, foraging behaviour, memory, mortality and colony reproduction), and for comparisons of the interactions of multiple classes of stressor (for example, agrochemical–parasite, parasite–nutrition, agrochemical–agrochemical and parasite–parasite interactions).</p><p>The authors conducted a monumental literature search that yielded almost 15,000 relevant individual studies. Siviter and colleagues combed through these publications to focus on the experiments that investigated the combined effect of parasites (microorganisms and invertebrates), agrochemicals and nutritional stressors on bee health. The authors selected studies that used a balanced and replicated experimental design, and that provided accessible data (means, standard deviations and sample sizes) for each treatment. This rigorous focus and quality control resulted in a final set of 90 studies being selected for further analysis.</p><p>These studies provide a total of 356 effect sizes (measurements indicating the magnitude of a relationship between factors of interest and a particular outcome) for different stressor and bee-response combinations. The authors accounted for data issues that might have confounded their accurate detection of bee responses. Such challenges included those arising from statistical non-independence of multiple effects reported from a single study, publication biases (for example, the lack of negative results), species skews (honey bee data sets predominated), and how experimental treatments such as pesticide dose compare with what might be realistically encountered in the field (termed field realism).</p><p>Siviter and colleagues tested whether the stressor interactions were synergistic, meaning that their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects, as would be the case if the effect of one stressor on a bee elevates the effect of another stressor. The authors also examined alternative scenarios in which the effects of multiple stressors were antagonistic (the effect of one stressor lessens the effect of another) or additive (the combined effect is equivalent to the sum of the individual effects).</p><p>A consistent message from their analysis is that bee mortality is increased by a synergistic interaction between multiple stressors — the worst-case scenario, indicating a disproportionate effect of multiple stressors on bee survival. Interactions between different agrochemicals, rather than other stressors, drove this overall effect, and this finding held true when accounting for the field realism of the agrochemical doses. This result confirms that the cocktail of agrochemicals that bees encounter in an intensively farmed environment can create a risk to bee populations<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">14</a></sup>. Multi-stressor interactions involving parasites and nutritional stress (including in combination with agrochemicals) produced additive effects on bee mortality overall.</p><p>The authors’ deeper analysis of the biological complexity, however, revealed large differences between particular parasite groups in terms of the full range of additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects on bee mortality, when considering interactions between different parasites or between different parasites and nutritional stress. This variability in response, together with the lower sample sizes for the interactions involving stressors other than agrochemicals, indicate a caveat to consider and also suggest a need for more research on the combined effects of biological sources of stress.</p><p>It is intriguing that Siviter and colleagues found that additive, not synergistic, effects predominated for the non-lethal effects of stressors on fitness proxies (such as modifications of bee behaviour or reproduction, changes in parasite load or immune function). Such non-lethal changes could ultimately affect bee mortality rates. Consequently, how the observed synergistic effects of agrochemicals on bee mortality arise remains to be established. More work is therefore needed to identify the mechanism that links exposure to behavioural or physiological changes and mortality.</p><p>The majority of the studies in the data set were of managed populations of <i>A. mellifera</i>, so the authors also separately analysed responses at the level of bee genus (<i>Apis</i>, <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Megachile</i> and <i>Osmia</i>). <i>Apis</i> mortality was affected by a synergistic multi-stressor interaction qualitatively similar to the full analysis of all bee genera. Other bee genera exhibited additive or antagonistic mortality responses from many fewer studies. This raises an important point. There is a need for research efforts and regulators to widen their focus from <i>A. mellifera</i> — a single, mostly managed bee species — to other pollinator model organisms, whose different ecology and evolutionary history might result in different responses to stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Siviter and colleagues’ findings of the cumulative negative effect of multi-stressor interactions on bees reinforces the call to evaluate such interactions to avoid unforeseen risks to biodiversity and healthy ecosystems<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. In some regions of the world, regulatory risk-assessment frameworks for plant-protection products are being developed to deal with sublethal, long-term and potentially synergistic effects among stressors<sup><a href="#ref-CR15" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">15</a></sup> (see <a href="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/3f4ax5r" data-track-category="body text link">go.nature.com/3f4ax5r</a>), but their biological and geographical scope must be extended. The authors acknowledge that the high levels of variability between the studies and parameters investigated demand an appropriately cautious interpretation. However, this highlights the need for worldwide reconsideration of risk-assessment approaches for pesticide regulation.</p><p>Given the widespread loss of habitat resources — such as pollen and nectar sources — from intensively managed agricultural landscapes<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>, nutritional deficits occurred surprisingly infrequently as a mechanism underlying bees’ physiological stress (they accounted for only 58 out of the 365 measurements of effect sizes). A greater consideration of how nutritional stress interacts with exposure to pathogens and agrochemicals is therefore an obvious research gap to fill. Moreover, ensuring that experimental treatments are calibrated to simulate realistic environmental conditions would greatly aid risk assessments. This might include three-way combinations of field-realistic chemical doses and parasite levels, and a spatio-temporal dietary diversity similar to that found in semi-natural or highly human-modified landscapes.</p><p>The next challenge is to look beyond these parasite–nutrition–agrochemical interactions to consider other risks to pollination. Future studies must ultimately consider, through a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, the interplay of nutrition–pathogen–agrochemical interactions alongside the effects of other human-driven changes (such as climate change, pollution, land-use changes and the spread of invasive species)<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. Although such assessments would be non-trivial to carry out, they will be vital for understanding and ranking the relative risks to pollinators and pollination that are coming from multiple combinations of pressures resulting from global changes.</p>

<p>Airyx is a new open source OS project that aims to provide a similar experience and some compatibiilty with macOS on x86-64 sytems. It builds on the solid foundations of FreeBSD, existing open source packages in the same space, and new code to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://airyx.org/" rel="nofollow">airyx.org</a> or join us on <a href="https://libera.chat" rel="nofollow">Libera IRC</a> in <code>#airyx</code> for more info!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bedef041d3a50f0bd26c945e533853f1520330780bd617f59c49ffb10900001c/68747470733a2f2f6170692e6369727275732d63692e636f6d2f6769746875622f6d737a6f656b2f61697279782e7376673f6272616e63683d6d61696e267461736b3d6169727978"></a></p>
<p>The main design goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>source compatibility with macOS applications (i.e. you could compile a Mac application on Airyx and run it)</li>
<li>similar GUI metaphors and familiar UX (file manager, application launcher, top menu bar that reflects the open application, etc)</li>
<li>compatible with macOS filesystems (HFS+ and APFS) and folder layouts (/Library, /System, /Users, /Volumes, etc)</li>
<li>self-contained applications in <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/AppDir">folders</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/AppImage">single file</a> and a (mostly) installer-less experience for /Applications</li>
<li>mostly maintain compatibility with the FreeBSD base system and X11 - a standard Unix environment under the hood</li>
<li>compatible with Linux binaries via FreeBSD&#39;s Linux support</li>
<li>eventual compatibility with x86-64 macOS binaries (Mach-O) and libraries</li>
<li>pleasant to use, secure, stable, and performant</li>
</ul>

Abstract

   This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are suited
   for use as a database key.

   A common case for modern applications is to create a unique
   identifier for use as a primary key in a database table.  This
   identifier usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable
   using the monotonic creation time in the most significant bits.  In
   addition the identifier is highly collision resistant, difficult to
   guess, and provides minimal security attack surfaces.  None of the
   existing UUID versions, including UUIDv1, fulfill each of these
   requirements in the most efficient possible way.  This document is a
   proposal to update [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] with three new UUID versions that
   address these concerns, each with different trade-offs.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


<span><a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Background</span>

   A lot of things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally
   created.  Modern applications have a need to use (and many have
   already implemented) UUIDs as database primary keys.

   The motivation for using UUIDs as database keys stems primarily from
   the fact that applications are increasingly distributed in nature.
   Simplistic &#34;auto increment&#34; schemes with integers in sequence do not
   work well in a distributed system since the effort required to
   synchronize such numbers across a network can easily become a burden.
   The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique and reasonably short
   values in distributed systems without requiring synchronization makes
   them a good candidate for use as a database key in such environments.

   However some properties of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] UUIDs are not well suited to
   this task.  First, most of the existing UUID versions such as UUIDv4
   have poor database index locality.  Meaning new values created in
   succession are not close to each other in the index and thus require
   inserts to be performed at random locations.  The negative
   performance effects of which on common structures used for this
   (B-tree and its variants) can be dramatic.  As such newly inserted
   values SHOULD be time-ordered to address this.

   While it is true that UUIDv1 does contain an embedded timestamp and
   can be time-ordered; UUIDv1 has other issues.  It is possible to sort
   Version 1 UUIDs by time but it is a laborious task.  The process
   requires breaking the bytes of the UUID into various pieces, re-
   ordering the bits, and then determining the order from the
   reconstructed timestamp.  This is not efficient in very large
   systems.  Implementations would be simplified with a sort order where
   the UUID can simply be treated as an opaque sequence of bytes and
   ordered as such.

   After the embedded timestamp, the remaining 64 bits are in essence
   used to provide uniqueness both on a global scale and within a given
   timestamp tick.  The clock sequence value ensures that when multiple
   UUIDs are generated for the same timestamp value are given a
   monotonic sequence value.  This explicit sequencing helps further
   facilitate sorting.  The remaining random bits ensure collisions are
   minimal.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   Furthermore, UUIDv1 utilizes a non-standard timestamp epoch derived
   from the Gregorian Calendar.  More specifically, the Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond intervals since
   00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.  Implementations and many languages may
   find it easier to implement the widely adopted and well known Unix
   Epoch, a custom epoch, or another timestamp source with various
   levels of timestamp precision required by the application.

   Lastly, privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
   address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC addresses
   can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and reveal
   various other information about such machines (minimally
   manufacturer, potentially other details).  Instead &#34;cryptographically
   secure&#34; pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) or pseudo-random
   number generators (PRNG) SHOULD be used within an application context
   to provide uniqueness and unguessability.

   Due to the shortcomings of UUIDv1 and UUIDv4 details so far, many
   widely distributed database applications and large application
   vendors have sought to solve the problem of creating a better time-
   based, sortable unique identifier for use as a database key.  This
   has lead to numerous implementations over the past 10+ years solving
   the same problem in slightly different ways.

   While preparing this specification the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

   An inspection of these implementations details the following trends
   that help define this standard:

      - Timestamps MUST be k-sortable.  That is, values within or close
      to the same timestamp are ordered properly by sorting algorithms.
      - Timestamps SHOULD be big-endian with the most-significant bits
      of the time embedded as-is without reordering.
      - Timestamps SHOULD utilize millisecond precision and Unix Epoch
      as timestamp source.  Although, there is some variation to this
      among implementations depending on the application requirements.
      - The ID format SHOULD be Lexicographically sortable while in the
      textual representation.
      - IDs MUST ensure proper embedded sequencing to facilitate sorting
      when multiple UUIDs are created during a given timestamp.
      - IDs MUST NOT require unique network identifiers as part of
      achieving uniqueness.
      - Distributed nodes MUST be able to create collision resistant
      Unique IDs without a consulting a centralized resource.

<span><a id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Summary of Changes</span>

   In order to solve these challenges this specification introduces
   three new version identifiers assigned for time-based UUIDs.

   The first, UUIDv6, aims to be the easiest to implement for
   applications which already implement UUIDv1.  The UUIDv6
   specification keeps the original Gregorian timestamp source but does
   not reorder the timestamp bits as per the process utilized by UUIDv1.
   UUIDv6 also requires that pseudo-random data MUST be used in place of
   the MAC address.  The rest of the UUIDv1 format remains unchanged in
   UUIDv6.  See <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>

   Next, UUIDv7 introduces an entirely new time-based UUID bit layout
   utilizing a variable length timestamp sourced from the widely
   implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source.  The
   timestamp is broken into a 36-bit integer sections part, and is
   followed by a field of variable length which represents the sub-
   second timestamp portion, encoded so that each bit from most to least
   significant adds more precision.  See <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>

   Finally, UUIDv8 introduces a relaxed time-based UUID format that
   caters to application implementations that cannot utilize UUIDv1,
   UUIDv6, or UUIDv7.  UUIDv8 also future-proofs this specification by
   allowing time-based UUID formats from timestamp sources that are not
   yet be defined.  The variable size timestamp offers lots of
   flexibility to create an implementation specific RFC compliant time-
   based UUID while retaining the properties that make UUID great.  See
   <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>

   The UUID length of 16 octets (128 bits) remains unchanged.  The
   textual representation of a UUID consisting of 36 hexadecimal and

   readability.  In addition the position of both the Version and
   Variant bits remain unchanged in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv6 aims to be the easiest to implement by reusing most of the
   layout of bits found in UUIDv1 but with changes to bit ordering for
   the timestamp.  Where UUIDv1 splits the timestamp bits into three
   distinct parts and orders them as time_low, time_mid,
   time_high_and_version.  UUIDv6 instead keeps the source bits from the
   timestamp intact and changes the order to time_high, time_mid, and
   time_low.  Incidentally this will match the original 60-bit Gregorian
   timestamp source.  The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from
   their usage and position in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  The 48-bit node MUST be set
   to a pseudo-random value.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 1

<span><a id="section-4.3.3" href="#section-4.3.3">4.3.3</a>.  UUIDv6 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv6 node bits SHOULD be set to a 48-bit random or pseudo-random
   number.  UUIDv6 nodes SHOULD NOT utilize an IEEE 802 MAC address or
   the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.5">[RFC4122], Section 4.5</a> method of generating a random multicast

<span><a id="section-4.3.4" href="#section-4.3.4">4.3.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The following implementation algorithm is based on [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>] but with
   changes specific to UUIDv6:

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time as a 60-bit count of 100-nanosecond
        intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.

   3.   Set the time_low field to the 12 least significant bits of the
        starting 60-bit timestamp.

   4.   Truncate the timestamp to the 48 most significant bits in order
        to create time_high_and_time_mid.

   5.   Set the time_high field to the 32 most significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

   6.   Set the time_mid field to the 16 least significant bits of the
        truncated timestamp.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   7.   Create the 16-bit time_low_and_version by concatenating the
        4-bit UUIDv6 version with the 12-bit time_low.

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp generate
        a random 14-bit clock sequence value.

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value.

   10.  Complete the 16-bit clock sequence high, low and reserved
        creation by concatenating the clock sequence onto UUID variant
        bits which take the most significant position in the 16-bit
        value.

   11.  Generate a 48-bit psuedo-random node.

   12.  Format by concatenating the 128 bits from each parts:
        time_high|time_mid|time_low_and_version|variant_clk_seq|node

   13.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   The steps for splitting time_high_and_time_mid into time_high and
   time_mid are optional since the 48-bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order as time_high_and_time_mid during the
   final concatenation.  This extra step of splitting into the most
   significant 32 bits and least significant 16 bits proves useful when
   reusing an existing UUIDv1 implementation.  In which the following
   logic can be applied to reshuffle the bits with minimal
   modifications.

<span><a id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  UUIDv7 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   The UUIDv7 format is designed to encode a Unix timestamp with
   arbitrary sub-second precision.  The key property provided by UUIDv7
   is that timestamp values generated by one system and parsed by
   another are guaranteed to have sub-section precision of either the
   generator or the parser, whichever is less.  Additionally, the system
   parsing the UUIDv7 value does not need to know which precision was
   used during encoding in order to function correctly.

   The format for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 2

<span><a id="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 utilizes a 36-bit big-endian unsigned Unix Timestamp value
   (number of seconds since the epoch of 1 Jan 1970, leap seconds
   excluded so each hour is exactly 3600 seconds long).

   Additional sub-second precision (millisecond, nanosecond,
   microsecond, etc) MAY be provided for encoding and decoding in the
   remaining bits in the layout.

<span><a id="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 SHOULD utilize a motonic sequence counter to provide
   additional sequencing guarantees when multiple UUIDv7 values are
   created in the same UNIXTS and SUBSEC timestamp.  The amount of bits
   allocates to the sequence counter depend on the precision of the
   timestamp.  For example, a more accurate timestamp source using
   nanosecond precision will require less clock sequence bits than a
   timestamp source utilizing seconds for precision.  For best
   sequencing results the sequence counter SHOULD be placed immediately
   after available sub-second bits.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  UUIDv7 Node Usage</span>

   UUIDv7 implementations, even with very detailed sub-second precision
   and the optional sequence counter, MAY have leftover bits that will
   be identified as the Node for this section.  The UUIDv7 Node MAY
   contain any set of data an implementation desires however the node
   MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure global uniqueness.
   In most scenarios the node SHOULD be filled with pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv7 bit layout for encoding and decoding are described

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.4.1">4.4.4.1</a>.  UUIDv7 Encoding</span>

   Since the UUIDv7 Unix timestamp is fixed at 36 bits in length the
   exact layout for encoding UUIDv7 depends on the precision (number of
   bits) used for the sub-second portion and the sizes of the optionally
   desired sequence counter and node bits.

   Three examples of UUIDv7 encoding are given below as a general
   guidelines but implementations are not limited to just these three
   examples.

   All of these fields are only used during encoding, and during
   decoding the system is unaware of the bit layout used for them and
   considers this information opaque.  As such, implementations
   generating these values can assign whatever lengths to each field it
   deems applicable, as long as it does not break decoding compatibility
   (i.e.  Unix timestamp (unixts), version (ver) and variant (var) have
   to stay where they are, and clock sequence counter (seq), random
   (random) or other implementation specific values must follow the sub-
   second encoding).

   In Figure 3 the UUIDv7 has been created with millisecond precision
   with the available sub-second precision bits.

   Examining Figure 3 one can observe:

   *  The first 36 bits have been dedicated to the Unix Timestamp
      (unixts)

   *  All 12 bits of scenario subsec_a is fully dedicated to millisecond
      information (msec).

   *  The 4 Version bits remain unchanged (ver).

   *  All 12 bits of subsec_b have been dedicated to a motonic clock
      sequence counter (seq).

   *  The 2 Variant bits remain unchanged (var).

   *  Finally the remaining 62 bits in the subsec_seq_node section are
      layout is filled out with random data to pad the length and
      provide guaranteed uniqueness (rand).

          Figure 5: UUIDv7 Field and Bit Layout - Encoding Example
                           (Nanosecond Precision)

<span><a id="section-4.4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.4.2">4.4.4.2</a>.  UUIDv7 Decoding</span>

   When decoding or parsing a UUIDv7 value there are only two values to
   be considered:

   1.  The unix timestamp defined as unixts

   2.  The sub-second precision values defined as subsec_a, subsec_b,
       and subsec_seq_node

   As detailed in Figure 2 the unix timestamp (unixts) is always the
   first 36 bits of the UUIDv7 layout.

   Similarly as per Figure 2, the sub-second precision values lie within
   subsec_a, subsec_b, and subsec_seq_node which are all interpreted as
   sub-second information after skipping over the version (ver) and
   (var) bits.  These concatenated sub-second information bits are
   interpreted in a way where most to least significant bits represent a
   further division by two.  This is the same normal place notation used
   to express fractional numbers, except in binary.  For example, in
   decimal &#34;.1&#34; means one tenth, and &#34;.01&#34; means one hundredth.  In this
   subsec field, a 1 means one half, 01 means one quarter, 001 is one
   eighth, etc.  This scheme can work for any number of bits up to the
   maximum available, and keeps the most significant data leftmost in
   the bit sequence.

   To perform the sub-second math, simply take the first (most
   significant/leftmost) N bits of subsec and divide it by 2^N.  Take
   for example:

   1.  To parse the first 16 bits, extract that value as an integer and
       divide it by 65536 (2 to the 16th).




<span>Peabody &amp; Davis          Expires 28 October 2021               [Page 15]</span></pre>
<hr/><!--NewPage--><pre><span id="page-16"></span>
<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   2.  If these 16 bits are 0101 0101 0101 0101, then treating that as
       an integer gives 0x5555 or 21845 in decimal, and dividing by
       65536 gives 0.3333282

   This sub-second encoding scheme provides maximum interoperability
   across systems where different levels of time precision are
   required/feasible/available.  The timestamp value derived from a
   UUIDv7 value SHOULD be &#34;as close to the correct value as possible&#34;
   when parsed, even across disparate systems.

   Take for example the starting point for our next two UUIDv7 parsing
   scenarios:

   1.  System A produces a UUIDv7 with a microsecond-precise timestamp
       value.

   2.  System B is unaware of the precision encoded in the UUIDv7
       timestamp by System A.

   Scenario 1:

   1.  System B parses the embedded timestamp with millisecond
       precision.  (Less precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B SHOULD return the correct millisecond value encoded by
       system A (truncated to milliseconds).

   Scenario 2:

   1.  System B parses the timestamp with nanosecond precision.  (More
       precision than the encoder)

   2.  System B&#39;s value returned SHOULD have the same microsecond level
       of precision provided by the encoder with the additional
       precision down to nanosecond level being essentially random as
       per the encoded random value at the end of the UUIDv7.

<span><a id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  UUIDv8 Layout and Bit Order</span>

   UUIDv8 offers variable-size timestamp, clock sequence, and node
   values which allow for a highly customizable UUID that fits a given
   application needs.

   UUIDv8 SHOULD only be utilized if an implementation cannot utilize
   UUIDv1, UUIDv6, or UUIDv8.  Some situations in which UUIDv8 usage
   could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp source not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp bit layout not
      defined by the current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like a specific level of precision within
      the timestamp not offered by current time-based UUIDs.

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID node other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the usage of one of the current time-based UUIDs.

   Roughly speaking a properly formatted UUIDv8 SHOULD contain the
   following sections adding up to a total of 128-bits.

      - Timestamp Bits (Variable Length)
      - Clock Sequence Bits (Variable Length)
      - Node Bits (Variable Length)
      - UUIDv8 Version Bits (4 bits)
      - UUID Variant Bits (2 Bits)

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific time-based UUIDs.  To be clear:
   UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
   filled with random data.  UUIDv8&#39;s 128 bits (including the version
   and variant) SHOULD contain at the minimum a timestamp of some format
   in the most significant bit position followed directly by a clock
   sequence counter and finally a node containing either random data or
   implementation specific data.

   A sample format in Figure 6 is used to further illustrate the point
   for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv8.

                   Figure 6: UUIDv8 Field and Bit Layout

   timestamp_32:
      The most significant 32 bits of the desired timestamp source.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3).

   timestamp_48:
      The next 16-bits of the timestamp source when a timestamp source
      with at least 48 bits is used.  When a 32-bit timestamp source is
      utilized, these bits are set to 0.  Occupies bits 32 through 47

   ver:
      The 4 bit UUIDv8 version (1000).  Occupies bits 48 through 51.

   time_or_seq:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp is used these 12-bits are used
      to fill out the remaining timestamp.  If a 32 or 48-bit timestamp
      is leveraged a 12-bit clock sequence MAY be used.  Together ver
      and time_or_seq occupy bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   var:
      2-bit UUID variant (10)

   seq_or_node:
      If a 60-bit, or larger, timestamp source is leverages these 8 bits
      SHOULD be allocated for an 8-bit clock sequence counter.  If a 32
      or 48 bit timestamp source is used these 8-bits SHOULD be set to
      random.

   node:
      In most implementations these bits will likely be set to pseudo-
      random data.  However, implementations utilize the node as they
      see fit.  Together var, seq_or_node, and node occupy Bits 64
      through 127 (octets 8-15)

<span><a id="section-4.5.1" href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a>.  UUIDv8 Timestamp Usage</span>

   UUIDv8&#39;s usage of timestamp relaxes both the timestamp source and
   timestamp length.  Implementations are free to utilize any
   monotonically stable timestamp source for UUIDv8.

   Some examples include:

      - Custom Epoch
      - NTP Timestamp
      - ISO 8601 timestamp

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   The relaxed nature UUIDv8 timestamps also works to future proof this
   specification and allow implementations a method to create compliant
   time-based UUIDs using timestamp source that might not yet be
   defined.

   Timestamps come in many sizes and UUIDv8 defines three fields that
   can easily used for the majority of timestamp lengths:

   *  32-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and setting timestamp_48 to
      0s

   *  48-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and timestamp_48 entirely

   *  60-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq

   *  64-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and
      time_or_seq and truncating the timestamp the 60 most significant
      bits.

   Although it is possible to create a timestamp larger than 64-bits in
   size The usage and bit layout of that timestamp format is up to the
   implementation.  When a timestamp exceeds the 64th bit (octet 7),
   extra care must be taken to ensure the Variant bits are properly
   inserted at their respective location in the UUID.  Likewise, the
   Version MUST always be implemented at the appropriate location.

   Any timestamps that does not entirely fill the timestamp_32,
   timestamp_48 or time_or_seq MUST set all leftover bits in the least
   significant position of the respective field to 0.  For example a
   36-bit timestamp source would fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits
   of timestamp_48.  The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set
   to 0.

   By using implementation-specific timestamp sources it is not
   guaranteed that devices outside of the application context are able
   to extract and parse the timestamp from UUIDv8 without some pre-
   existing knowledge of the source timestamp used by the UUIDv8
   implementation.

<span><a id="section-4.5.2" href="#section-4.5.2">4.5.2</a>.  UUIDv8 Clock Sequence Usage</span>

   A clock sequence MUST be used with UUIDv8 as added sequencing
   guarantees when multiple UUIDv8 will be created on the same clock
   tick.  The amount of bits allocated to the clock sequence depends on
   the precision of the timestamp source.  For example, a more accurate
   timestamp source using nanosecond precision will require less clock
   sequence bits than a timestamp source utilizing seconds for
   precision.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 generically defines two possible clock
   sequence values that can leveraged:

   *  12-bit clock sequence using time_or_seq for use when the timestamp
      is less than 48-bits which allows for 4095 UUIDs per clock tick.
   *  8-bit clock sequence using seq_or_node when the timestamp uses
      more than 48-bits which allows for 255 UUIDs per clock tick.

   An implementation MAY use both time_or_seq and seq_or_node for clock
   sequencing however it is highly unlikely that 20-bits of clock
   sequence are needed for a given clock tick.  Furthermore, more bits
   from the node MAY be used for clock sequencing in the event that
   8-bits is not sufficient.

   The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically for
   each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
   When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to
   zero.  The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless
   the timestamp has incremented.  Care MUST be given to ensure that an
   adequate sized clock sequence is selected for a given application
   based on expected timestamp precision and expected UUID generation
   rates.

<span><a id="section-4.5.3" href="#section-4.5.3">4.5.3</a>.  UUIDv8 Node Usage</span>

   The UUIDv8 Node MAY contain any set of data an implementation desires
   however the node MUST NOT be set to all 0s which does not ensure
   global uniqueness.  In most scenarios the node will be filled with
   pseudo-random data.

   The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 defines 2 sizes of Node depending on
   the timestamp size:

   *  62-bit node encompassing seq_or_node and node Used when a
      timestamp of 48-bits or less is leveraged.
   *  54-bit node when all 60-bits of the timestamp are in use and the
      seq_or_node is used as clock sequencing.

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   An implementation MAY choose to allocate bits from the node to the
   timestamp, clock sequence or application-specific embedded field.  It
   is recommended that implementation utilize a node of at least 48-bits
   to ensure global uniqueness can be guaranteed.

<span><a id="section-4.5.4" href="#section-4.5.4">4.5.4</a>.  UUIDv6 Basic Creation Algorithm</span>

   The entire usage of UUIDv8 is meant to be variable and allow as much
   customization as possible to meet specific application/language
   requirements.  As such any UUIDv8 implementations will likely vary
   among applications.

   The following algorithm is a generic implementation using Figure 6
   and the recommendations outlined in this specification.

   *32-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to all 0s

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (time_or_node) to 0

   7.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (time_or_node).

   8.   Set the variant to binary 10

   9.   Generate 62 random bits and fill in 8-bits for seq_or_node and
        54-bits for the node.

   10.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

<span>Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                  April 2021</span>


   11.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *48-bit timestamp, 12-bit sequence counter, 62-bit node:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
       bits.

   3.  Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 most significant bits
       from the timestamp

   4.  Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 least significant bits from the
       timestamp

   5.  The rest of the steps are the same as the previous example.

   *60-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.   From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
        variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
        timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.   Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as 32
        bits.

   3.   Set the 32-bit field timestamp_32 to the 32 bits from the
        timestamp

   4.   Set 16-bit timestamp_48 to the 16 middle bits from the timestamp

   5.   Set the version to 8 (1000)

   6.   Set 12-bit time_or_node to the 12 least significant bits from
        the timestamp

   7.   Set the variant to 10

   8.   If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted)
        or the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
        12-bit clock sequence value (seq_or_node) to 0

   9.   If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
        or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
        value (seq_or_node).

   10.  Generate 54 random bits and fill in the node

   11.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits as: timestamp_32|timestamp_
        48|version|time_or_node|variant|seq_or_node|node

   12.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to
        the stable store

   *64-bit timestamp, 8-bit sequence counter, 54-bit node:*

   1.  The same steps as the 60-bit timestamp can be utilized if the
       64-bit timestamp is truncated to 60-bits.

   2.  Implementations MAY chose to truncate the most or least
       significant bits but it is recommended to utilize the most
       significant 60-bits and lose 4 bits of precision in the
       nanoseconds or microseconds position.

   *General algorithm for generation of UUIDv8 not defined here:*

   1.  From a system-wide shared stable store (e.g., a file) or global
       variable, read the UUID generator state: the values of the
       timestamp and clock sequence used to generate the last UUID.

   2.  Obtain the current time from the selected clock source as desired
       bit total

   3.  Set total amount of bits for timestamp as required in the most
       significant positions of the 128-bit UUID

   4.  Care MUST be taken to ensure that the UUID Version and UUID
       Variant are in the correct bit positions.

       UUID Version: Bits 48 through 51

       UUID Variant: Bits 64 and 65

   5.  If the state was unavailable (e.g., non-existent or corrupted) or
       the timestamp is greater than the current timestamp; set the
       desired clock sequence value to 0

   6.  If the state was available, but the saved timestamp is less than
       or equal to the current timestamp, increment the clock sequence
       value.

   7.  Set the remaining bits to the node as pseudo-random data

   8.  Format by concatenating the 128-bits together

   9.  Save the state (current timestamp and clock sequence) back to the
       stable store

<span><a id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Encoding and Storage</span>

   The existing UUID hex and dash format of 8-4-4-4-12 is retained for
   both backwards compatibility and human readability.

   For many applications such as databases this format is unnecessarily
   verbose totaling 288 bits.

   *  8-bits for each of the 32 hex characters = 256 bits
   *  8-bits for each of the 4 hyphens = 32 bits

   Where possible UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database applications as
   the underlying 128-bit binary value.

<span><a id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Global Uniqueness</span>

   UUIDs created by this specification offer the same guarantees for
   global uniqueness as those found in [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>].  Furthermore, the
   time-based UUIDs defined in this specification are geared towards
   database applications but MAY be used for a wide variety of use-
   cases.  Just as global uniqueness is guaranteed, UUIDs are guaranteed
   to be unique within an application context within the enterprise
   domain.

<span><a id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Distributed UUID Generation</span>

   Some implementations might desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve 2 or more applications independently
   generating UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  UUIDs
   already feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of
   collision are low.  However, implementations MAY dedicate a portion
   of the node&#39;s most significant random bits to a pseudo-random
   machineID which helps identify UUIDs created by a given node.  This
   works to add an extra layer of collision avoidance.

   This machine ID MUST be placed in the UUID proceeding the timestamp
   and sequence counter bits.  This position is selected to ensure that
   the sorting by timestamp and clock sequence is still possible.  The
   machineID MUST NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address.  The creation and
   negotiation of the machineID among distributed nodes is out of scope
   for this specification.

   This document has no IANA actions.

<span><a id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and MUST not be used for
   node generation.  As such they have been strictly forbidden from
   time-based UUIDs within this specification.  Instead pseudo-random
   bits SHOULD selected from a source with sufficient entropy to ensure
   guaranteed uniqueness among UUID generation.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with the clock sequence does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and it&#39;s corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122" title="&#34;A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace&#34;">RFC4122</a>]
   UUIDv4 SHOULD be utilized.

   The machineID portion of node, described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, does provide
   small unique identifier which could be used to determine which
   application is generating data but this machineID alone is not enough
   to identify a node on the network without other corresponding data
   points.  Furthermore the machineID, like the timestamp+sequence, does
   not provide any context about the data the corresponds to the UUID or
   the current state of the application as a whole.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
        
                
                                                    
            <p>When it comes to internet speed tests, <a href="https://www.ookla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Speedtest</a> is the gold standard. So when Ookla examined its data for <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Starlink</a> and its satellite internet rivals, <a href="https://www.hughesnet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">HughesNet</a> and <a href="https://www.viasat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Viasat</a>, the numbers it comes up with are meaningful. </p>
		    

                        
    	<p>To no great surprise, <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-hughesnet-viasat-performance-q2-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Ookla found Starlink beats HughesNet and Viasat handly</a>. The company found that &#34;Starlink was the only satellite internet provider in the United States with fixed-broadband-like latency figures, and median download speeds fast enough to handle most of the needs of modern online life at 97.23 Megabits per second (Mbps) during Q2 2021. HughesNet was a distant second at 19.73 Mbps and Viasat third at 18.13 Mbps.&#34;</p><p>As for latency, the time between when you start an activity over the internet and when you get a response back, it&#39;s not even a competition. Starlink&#39;s median latency, 45 milliseconds (ms) is close to fixed broadband&#39;s 14 ms. Low latency is vital for voice and video calling, gaming, and live content streaming. By comparison, Viasat, 630 ms, and HughesNet, 724 ms, are almost unusable for these purposes. </p><p>Why was there such a huge difference? It&#39;s simple physics. Unless we ever get <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-unveils-blueprint-quantum-internet-launch-future-quantum-internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">quantum networking</a>, we can&#39;t network faster than the speed of light. Starlink uses low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, flying above us at a relatively close 550 to 1,200 kilometers (km), while HughesNet and Viasat have far higher geosynchronous orbits of about 35,000km.</p><p>Of course, even Starlink isn&#39;t as fast as cable or fiber-based internet. According to Ookla, the median fixed-broadband in the US is 115.22Mbps with a latency of 15ms. But, Starlink was never meant to compete with Earth-bound internet in cities and suburbs. It&#39;s meant to offer an alternative to people living in the country. There I know people who are still using -- yes, I&#39;m serious -- dial-up modems and slow-as-dirt DSL connections with speeds that go all the way down to Kilobits per second (Kbps). </p><p>For these users, Starlink is clearly the better choice. But, Starlink is still being rolled out. This means some places at some times get much better performance than others. Ookla found at the top were users in Morgan county, Alabama at 168.30 Mbps, while lagging more than 100 Mbps behind were the residents of Madison County, Indiana.</p><p>Generally speaking, due to how the Starlink satellite constellations are currently set up, the farther North you live, the better your connection. But, as Morgan county shows, that&#39;s not a hard and fast rule. For example, in Canada Starlink&#39;s median download speed of 86.92 Mbps exceeded the country&#39;s median fixed broadband speed of 84.24 Mbps. </p>

    
<p>In other countries, such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom Starlink&#39;s speed vastly beats terrestrial internet speeds. In France, Starlink&#39;s download speed 139.39 Mbps, easily outran the country-wide fixed broadband average speed of 70.81 Mbp. With Germany, the difference is even larger. A German internet user can expect to see a Starlink speed of 107.98 Mbps while its Earth-bound competitors come in at 58.17 Mbps. While in the UK, and not just in those areas of Scotland far away from the usual internet providers, Starlink&#39;s 108.30 Mbps beats fixed broadband, 50.14 Mbps, hollow. Of course, in all cases, Starlink&#39;s latency will be slower than its territorial competitors. You can&#39;t beat physics. </p><p>You might be wondering how HughesNet and Viasat can stay in business. The reason for that is simple. They&#39;re the only internet game in town in many countries. For instance, in Brazil, Viasat&#39;s 60.30 Mbps download speed is comparable to fixed broadband&#39;s 61.38 Mbps. If you live in the campos, the countryside, you can get Viasat, where you may not have a practical alternative. </p><p>But, while Starlink may sound wonderful, its manufacturing lines are still lagging far behind demand. I, for instance, have yet to see my Starlink Terminal and I ordered it almost six months ago. </p><p>In theory, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">Starlink will be available around the world by September.</a> In practice, I&#39;m not counting on it. </p><p>Is Starlink for everyone? No. But, if you live beyond the reach of conventional high-speed internet or areas with poor general internet service, you&#39;ll want to try to get it. Once in hand, it&#39;s clearly the best satellite internet service.</p><p><strong>Related Stories:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/starlink-satellite-internet-how-does-it-work-cost-features-speed/">Starlink: Elon Musk&#39;s satellite internet explained</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/spacex-president-says-starlink-global-satellite-broadbrand-service-to-be-live-by-september/">SpaceX president says Starlink global satellite broadband service to be live by September</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ins-and-outs-of-starlink-internet-from-the-sky/">The ins and outs of Starlink: Internet from the sky</a></li></ul>

    (1,072 miles) across two days to see her for the first time since Covid started.  I was happy to see Mom, happy about the first road-trip in a
    long time, and happy to have tested the hypothesis that, in 2021, a fully-electric vehicle can handle long-haul travel.</p>

<p>My Mom, welcoming us to Saskatchewan. Normally she doesn’t look like the queen.</p>
<p>This essay gathers together the data from the trip and tries to draw
    conclusions. There’s also a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/timbray/status/1422578253835821058">real-time Twitter thread</a> with typos and bad pictures.</p>

<p>To my non-metric readers: Sorry, it’s in km.  I’ll convert a few of the key numbers.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>The experience</span> · 
It was pretty wonderful, actually.  The Jaguar is a comfortable modern car with great seats, good audio, and all the
    automation you’d expect.  It has awesome, overwhelming acceleration power for when you’re in a tricky passing situation.
    My daughter was excellent company.
    Cruising along a good road<span> —</span> and a lot of the Trans-Canada highway
    is<span> —</span> becomes a pretty pleasing experience.</p>

<p>The worst part, by a wide margin, was the wildfire smoke, between us and some of the
    world’s most fantastic scenery.  But that’s a symptom of the onrushing climate crisis, and one of the best things we can do to
    mitigate the devastation is to stop burning fossil fuels to travel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_135917188.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Smoky sun while charging in West Hills Mall, Calgary</p>
<p>Of course, this road trip was different from any previous experience, because charging.  In a fossil car, you don’t have to think,
    you just wait for the tank to get a half or three quarters down, then pull over at the next station.  Recharging requires
    planning; fortunately the tools are pretty good; more on that below.</p>

<p id="p-9"><span>The chargers</span> · 
One reason I decided this experiment was worth trying was Petro-Canada’s message about their
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Electric Highway</a> program, and I quote: “We
    have a charger every 250 km or less from Halifax, N.S. to Victoria, B.C.” There’s one not far from where I live in Vancouver, i
    tried it, and it worked first time with just a credit-card tap, no fuss no muss.</p>

<p>Trouble is, that quote is kind of a lie. There are gaps, and that’s when all the chargers are working, which fairly regularly
    they’re not. But my experience is that Petro-Can, while good, is never your only charging option.</p>

<p>Some background is required here. “High-power” Fast DC chargers come at multiple power levels: I saw 50, 100, 200, and
    350kW. The difference makes a difference.  Our Jag can only really charge at 100kW, but my personal perception is that the
    higher-power chargers fill up that last 20% much faster.  And it feels complicated; for example, in my
    experience with a Co-op Connect charger, rated at “only” 100kW, it felt faster.</p>

<p>When you use these things, they feel like first-generation tech, pushing the edges of what’s possible (or at least
    maintainable). In particular, when you plug a 350kW charger into a car with a really low battery, once it’s finished syncing and
    starts pumping electrons, the sound torques up like a 747 taking off.  And the installations include multiple big tall metal
    boxes (see the picture below).  Also, the huge big thick connecting wire gets super hot to the touch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210804_041820412.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Charging can be glamorous!</p>
<p>Anyhow, my impression of the Petro-Can network remains mostly positive. The machines work well.  It’s annoying that some are
    100kW, some 200, and some 350, for no obvious reason. It’s annoying that sometimes they’re stuck into a weird grubby back corner of the
    lot in a way that makes it hard to get your car in the right position to reach the charging port with the wire.  But, good on
    ’em.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electrify-canada.ca">Electrify Canada</a> is another organization that’s promising a national network of
    fast chargers. They’re a partner of Electrify America, constructed by Volkswagen as part of their settlement over cheating on
    emissions testing. Anyhow, maybe they’ll be great some day. Once I was far enough into the trip to have Petro-Can fully worked
    out, I tried to find an Electrify charger in working condition but failed.</p>

<p>If you’re OK with using 50kW chargers there are loads and loads of options. Many smaller-town Visitor Centres and and
    Chambers of Commerce put one in, as has my own electrical utility, BC Hydro.  Once you’ve worked with a higher-power charger
    though, they’re just not a satisfying experience.</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>The numbers</span> · 
Each line in the table below represents one driving leg and includes the charging experience at the beginning of that leg (thus absent
    on each day’s initial leg). I think the column headings are mostly pretty obvious, except perhaps
    for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>kWh/h</b> is the amount of juice divided by the driving pause. Often the charger would report less time, which I put down
    to initialization delay, so I think I’m using the right value. The variation here is a little random, because how fast it goes
    depends strongly on how empty your battery is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>km/ch</b> stands for “km per charge-hour”, estimating the amount of road range you
    get per hour of charging. Which I think is a really important number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Network</b>; “PC” is
    <a href="https://www.petro-canada.ca/en/personal/fuel/canadas-electric-highway">Petro-Canada</a>, “Flo”
    <a href="https://www.flo.com/en-CA/">isn’t an acronym</a>, and “Co-op” is
    <a href="https://www.fuel.crs/more/electric">Co-op Connect</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two data sources: The drive-time data is from Jaguar’s trip logging via their
    <a href="https://incontrol.jaguar.com/">Incontrol</a> app; thus the awkwardness caused by non-charge roadside stops.
    The charge-time data is the output from the various charging sessions along the way.  I’m
    certain that neither is perfect, but the results seem intuitively in the right neighborhood, based on my experience.</p>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at the numbers that seem interesting to me.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Charge time</span> · 
17:42 driving, 6:24 charging (including one evening charge after the day’s drive was finished).  Not that great on the face
    of it. Now, it clearly could have been less; since my confidence 
    that any given charger would Just Work started out weak, I was carefully allowing for failures and not running the battery
    very low. Later on in the trip as I gained confidence (specifically in the Petro-Canada network) I was willing to take on things
    like the Calgary-to-Medicine Hat leg, 2:43 and 285.9km, running the battery from 90% down to 11%.</p>

<p>Also my daughter is after all a teen-ager, and perhaps not quite as quick as I moving through cafes
    and restrooms and so on.</p>

<p>Also note that the legs are kind of short; this car can go 400km on a charge. But not when you’re on a big wide modern
    Prairie highway with almost no other traffic, blasting along at 110km/h (65mph) or more, continuously. I think you’d find this
    true of pretty well every electric vehicle.</p>

<p>But, here’s the thing: It didn’t <em>feel</em> excessive. I can only remember a total of maybe fifteen minutes when we were
    consciously just hanging waiting for charge. Most places, we got a coffee or lunch, hit the bathroom, took a walk around the block
    for our knees’ sake, and then it was time to unplug and go.</p>

<p>Having said that, this is a 2019 model-year car and the charging technology is improving. If we’d had a
    Porsche Taycan and nothing but 350kW chargers, the story would have been very different.  Will the fast-charging technology make the leap
    into the mainstream-car price plane? Will 350kW chargers become ubiquitious? I’d like to know.</p>

<p>In this context, there’s another number there that I think is really interesting: The “km/c-h”, how far you can get on an
    hour’s charge. For this particular car on this selection of chargers, it was over 200km (124 miles) per charge-hour.  I think
    that’s enough? Maybe in the lower regions of enough, but there.</p>

<p>And finally, I suspect every driving-safety professional would beam in approval of a power system that forces you to get out
    of the car and move around every couple of hundred km.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>$$$</span> · 
It cost us $120.52 in electricity. Is that a lot or a little?  I tentatively think they’re undercharging. While the
    electricity itself is pretty cheap, the charging infrastructure isn’t. If this is going to work, the charging networks are going
    to have to make money and I don’t see it at these prices.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that at home with the Level 2 charger in the carport, charging feels close to free. Travel maybe doesn’t need to be as
    cheap as the networks are currently making it.</p>

<p>Also, charging by the minute seems wrong. I guess having a time-based component makes sense to keep slow chargers from
    soaking up all the time, but especially at an extra-high-powered charger, a Porsche Taycan is going to get a whole lot more
    range out of each minute than a five-year-old Nissan Leaf, so why should they pay less for the same amount of range? Hmmmm.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>PlugShare</span> · 
If you’ve got a Tesla there’s less planning, the cars know where the Superchargers are.  If you have anything else, you really need
    <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a>.  There are a few apps in this space, but PlugShare is best at showing
    you a map with all the chargers on it, and thus helping you route-plan.  The reason it works is because it’s social; whenever
    you hit a charging station you can “Check In” and leave a note saying whether it’s working and how fast it goes.  This
    dramatically reduces the risk of rolling up to a station and finding it broken.     I absolutely
    don’t think this journey would have been possible without it. </p>

<p>Pro tip: When you’re planning a trip on PlugShare, put in <em>all</em> the chargers you might be able to use as you go along. Then
    when you’re driving, you can look at your remaining range and your upcoming options and most choices become pretty easy.  It’s
    got a limited but decent Android Auto app that I used a lot. (I assume CarPlay too?)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/05/-big/PXL_20210803_154006840.jpg.html"></a></p>
<p>Jaguar I-Pace and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_Mach-E">Mustang Mach-E</a> charging up in Hope, BC.</p>
<p id="p-6"><span>Futures</span> · 
A question: Are there enough chargers, or too many?  At the moment, the answer is probably “too many”. One of the things I really
    worried about was limping into some charging station to find all the chargers occupied and having to wait for an hour
    before I could even start.  The picture above shows the only time I saw other humans; a young couple with a
    four-day-old Mustang Mach-E, off for a joyride to Kamloops.  Otherwise, the chargers we visited showed no signs of
    life. Somebody spent a lot of money to build an expensive resource that is today largely un-used.</p>

<p>Having said that, anyone with even a shred of optimism about our future has to believe there are going to be a whole lot more
    battery-electric cars coming. Here in BC at the west edge of Canada we have
    <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/b-c-tops-north-america-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-2020-says-minister">North
    America’s highest EV uptake</a>, pushing 10% of new car sales.</p>

<p>When we were charging at the big Petro-Can station in Kamloops, walking from the the two well-positioned chargers to the
    coffee shop, we went by the gas-sales part, which was <em>massive</em>, at least a dozen pumps and cars lined up for every
    one.</p>

<p>At some point that picture will flip, and there’ll be occasional vendors that still sell gas, but mostly just 
    slick, fast, chargers.  I worry that the process will be kind of painful, but I’m sure it’ll happen. So I hope someone’s
    planning the transition.</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Would you do it again?</span> · 
Definitely.</p>

<p>And everyone should stop driving fossil vehicles starting now. Because the climate crisis is upon us. We can’t prevent it now, but we can save
    lives and reduce destruction if we slash carbon output. There’s no excuse not to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Homeless residents of a state-run tent city in Honolulu, Hawaii, are having their eyes scanned by a robotic police dog.</p><p>Police in the city say it&#39;s a safer way to check for symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>But local civil rights advocates say the use of the robot – called Spot – dehumanises some of Honolulu&#39;s most vulnerable residents.</p><p>&#34;Because these people are houseless it’s considered OK to do that,” said Jongwook Kim, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii. “At some point it will come out again for some different use after the pandemic is over&#34;.</p><h2>&#39;COVID safe&#39;</h2><p>Acting Lt. Joseph O’Neal of the Honolulu Police Department’s community outreach unit defended the robot’s use in a media demonstration earlier this year.</p><p>He said it had protected officers, shelter staff and residents by scanning people’s body temperatures at a shelter where they could quarantine and get tested for COVID-19.</p><p>The robot is also used to remotely interview individuals who have tested positive for the virus.</p><p>&#34;We have not had a single person out there that said, ‘That’s scary, that’s worrisome,’&#34; O’Neal said. &#34;We don’t just walk around and arbitrarily scan people&#34;.</p><p>Police use of such robots is still rare and largely untested — and hasn’t always gone over well with the public.</p><p>Honolulu officials faced a backlash when a local news organisation, Honolulu Civil Beat, revealed that the Spot purchase was made with federal relief money.</p><h2>Public outcry in New York</h2><p>Late last year, the New York Police Department started using Spot after painting it blue and renaming it &#34;Digidog&#34;. It went mostly unnoticed until New Yorkers began spotting it in the wild and posting videos to social media.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the department returned the robot to its manufacturer.</p><p>&#34;This is some Robocop stuff, this is crazy,&#34; was the reaction in April from Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman.</p><p>He was one of several New York politicians to speak out after a widely shared video showed the robot strutting with police officers responding to a domestic-violence report at a high-rise public housing building in Manhattan.</p><p>Days later, after further scrutiny from elected city officials, the department said it was terminating its lease and returning the robot.</p><p>The expensive machine arrived with little public notice or explanation, public officials said, and was deployed to already over-policed public housing. Use of the high-tech canine also clashed with Black Lives Matter calls to defund police operations and reinvest in other priorities.</p><p>In the aftermath of the fiasco, Boston Dynamics, the company that makes the robots, Boston Dynamics, said it needed to do a better job of explaining the technology to the public and customers who have had little experience with it.</p><h2>&#39;Just a tool&#39;</h2><p>For the Dutch national police, one of the company’s customers, explaining the technology includes emphasising that Spot is a very good robot — well-behaved and not so smart after all.</p><p>&#34;It doesn’t think for itself,&#34; Marjolein Smit, director of the special operations unit of the Dutch national police, said of the remote-controlled robot. &#34;If you tell it to go to the left, it will go to the left. If you tell it to stop, it will stop&#34;.</p><p>Earlier this year, her police division sent its robot into the site of a deadly drug lab explosion near the Belgian border to check for dangerous chemicals and other hazards.</p><p>According to Boston Dynamics, its acceptable use guidelines prohibit Spot’s weaponisation or anything that would violate privacy or civil rights laws, which it said puts the Honolulu police in the clear ethically.</p><p>It&#39;s all part of a year-long effort by the company, which in the past relied on military funding, to make its robots seem friendlier and thus more palatable to local governments and consumer-oriented businesses.</p><h2>Military-grade</h2><p>By contrast, a lesser-known rival, Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, has no qualms about weaponisation and supplies its dog-like robots to several branches of the US military and its allies.</p><p>&#34;It’s just plug and play, anything you want,&#34; said Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh, who was critical of Boston Dynamics’ stated ethical principles as &#34;selective morality&#34; because of the company’s past involvement with the military.</p><p>Parikh added that his company doesn’t market its four-legged robots to police departments, though he said it would make sense for police to use them.</p><p>&#34;It’s basically a camera on a mobile device,&#34; he said.</p><p>There are roughly 500 Spot robots now in the wild. Perry said they&#39;re commonly used by utility companies to inspect high-voltage zones and other hazardous areas. Spot is also used to monitor construction sites, mines and factories, equipped with whatever sensor is needed for the job.</p><p>It’s still mostly controlled by humans, though all they have to do is tell it which direction to go and it can intuitively climb stairs or cross over rough terrain.
