Worryingly, the survey found that many employees agreed with that assessment. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nearly two in five (39%) admitted that their cyber-security practices at home were less thorough than those practised in the office, with half admitting that this is a result of feeling less scrutinised by their IT departments now, than prior to Covid. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;One of the main mistakes we&#39;ve seen is moving company data to personal e-mail accounts,&#34; says Henry Trevelyan-Thomas, Tessian&#39;s vice-president of Customer Success.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When you do that, it&#39;s likely you don&#39;t have any sort of two-factor authentication. This then makes it easier for attackers to exploit that data. If data is leaked, attackers compromise it and it can end up in the wrong hands.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Tessian</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Mr. Trevelyan-Thomas warns that personal email accounts pose big risks to employers</figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>&#39;Climate of uncertainty&#39;</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Experts also warn of a significant growth in the number of coronavirus-themed phishing emails targeting employees, being reported by several companies around the world.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>During the height of the pandemic in 2020, network security firm <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52319093">Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails</a>.  Google also reported, at the time, that it was blocking over 100 million phishing emails daily. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Social engineering and phishing work best when there&#39;s a climate of uncertainty,&#34; Casey Ellis, founder of security platform, BugCrowd, tells the BBC. &#34;As an attacker in that scenario, I&#39;ve got a base of fear to work off of.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>The pandemic sparked a huge rise in malicious phishing emails</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Ellis says for example, one method hackers may use in a post-pandemic world could be an email that lures victims in with the promise of appointments for those who are currently unvaccinated against the virus.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You&#39;ve got an entire population wanting the pandemic to end. They&#39;re more likely to click on that,&#34; he says. &#34;I think that companies should proactively consider that it&#39;s a really good time to invest in training to work through these kinds of scenarios.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The consequences of such phishing attacks can often be dire. While global multinationals may be able to recover from substantial losses, cyber-attacks can be catastrophic for both small businesses and individuals.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In November 2020, a Sydney-based hedge fund collapsed after a senior executive clicked on a fraudulent Zoom invitation. The company - Levitas Capital - reportedly <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/levitas-capital-closing-after-fake-zoom-invite-sinks-16m-super-fund-investment/news-story/110750489020507558921a95cbe2c980">lost $8.7m to the cyber-attack</a> and was forced to close.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>The US Department of Justice and the FBI have becoming increasingly vocal saying they will crack down harder on hackers in 2021</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The hackers were able to access their systems, sending out multiple fraudulent invoices, and the damage was so great that their largest client pulled out of a planned multi-million-dollar investment,&#34; says Tony Pepper, the co-founder of security firm Egress. &#34;With enough pressure, businesses will fold.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Now, with many employers demanding workers return to the office at least part-time, experts say there are several steps companies should take to ensure that proper security procedures are put in place to keep both themselves and their employees safe. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15521824">New Tech Economy</a> is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>&#39;Prepare to face the ramifications&#39;</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mary Guzman, the founder of Crown Jewel Insurance, is urging firms to carefully screen personal devices that have been used for work on a remote-basis during the pandemic. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Before anyone is allowed to use them, or connect to any corporate network, appropriate analysis, and protective measures should be taken to ensure malware is not present,&#34; she tells the BBC. &#34;Until that can safely take place, perhaps personal devices should not be allowed back in the office.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mrs. Guzman says that employers now have two options to consider; they can re-train their employees so they know how to navigate cyber security in a post-pandemic world, or prepare themselves to &#34;face the ramifications are for failing to do so.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, Tessian&#39;s Henry Trevelyn-Thomas says that the most important thing is that companies urgently take steps to address threats if they haven&#39;t already. He believes the current heightened risk of cyber-attacks is likely to become the new normal.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a short-term phenomenon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="compact"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Frances Mao</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>ADAM PEATY/TIKTOK</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>A modern way to celebrate: Swimmer Adam Peaty flashing his gold on TikTok</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>At first the video seems to be just an ordinary guy in a tracksuit, miming a rap song on his phone.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But then British swimmer Adam Peaty whips out his Olympic gold medal.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And the crowd, in the comments section, goes wild.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;re living in a time where Olympic athletes casually make TikToks after winning a gold medal,&#34; reads one comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The world had watched the 26-year-old clinch victory in the men&#39;s 100m breaststroke. Barely a few hours later, he was sharing his win on TikTok.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Welcome to #OlympicTok - the channel where Gen Z athletes are using their favourite social media app to share their Games experience.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Broadcasters may own rights to all the sporting action, but TikTok is offering a different viewing experience altogether.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From tours of the Athletes&#39; Village to &#34;A Day in the Life Of&#34; vlogs, these snippets of athlete life have exploded on the app, drawing tens of millions of views.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s not the first time social media has featured at an Olympics Games. Athletes are also using older platforms - Facebook, Twitter and Instagram- to express themselves.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But this year, TikTok - the most downloaded app of 2020 - is having its moment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This is the TikTok-athlete generation. Or the athlete-TikTok generation. I&#39;m not sure which one comes first,&#34; says Jonathan Hutchinson, a social media expert at the University of Sydney.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>The TikTok Games</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>What does backstage at the Olympics look like on TikTok?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One clip shows nine Israeli baseball players jumping up and down on the same bed to test its cardboard frame.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Another shows Australian teammates taping a sign to their balcony to flirt with the American athletes in a neighbouring tower.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There are videos of basketballers learning how to put on a tie for the opening ceremony; sprinters trying out Japanese snacks; fencers making fun of their own slip-ups.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As one TikTok user wrote under a video: &#34;Olympians are seeming like normal people this year...&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The athletes - most of them young adults - film themselves doing dorky dances and pranking teammates - in general, goofing around.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Rayssa Leal / Margie Didal / TIKTOK</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>The TV cameras may have captured the tricks performed by Rayssa Leal and Margie Didal but they didn&#39;t get the TikTok dance on the sidelines</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You get to see that lighter side of the athlete - someone who is going through this amazing life experience and bringing all of their fans into that space with them,&#34; says Dr Hutchinson. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is that sense of fun which is core to TikTok&#39;s identity, he says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It sets it apart from other apps like Instagram, which users associate with aspirational, beautiful content. Anything too polished doesn&#39;t do well on TikTok. Its users prefer videos which are funny, irreverent, and above all &#34;authentic&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So bringing that lens to an event like the Olympics - the world&#39;s biggest, shiniest stage - is near irresistible.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>What else makes TikTok so popular?</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Traditionally, the public only ever sees Olympians when they&#39;re in competitions - performing their incredible, superhuman feats of speed, strength and skill. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Even the word Olympian means &#34;suggestive of the gods&#34;, derived as it is from the Ancient Greek deities.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But on TikTok, that mystique is shattered. One TikTok user, after watching some athletes joke around, marvelled that Olympians were just &#34;real people&#34; after all.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For the athletes - performing to empty stadiums these Games - TikTok also gives them a platform to hear from their fans, and presents opportunities for certain personalities to break through.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The most popular Olympians on TikTok aren&#39;t the most famous, household names. Instead they&#39;re slightly more obscure athletes, such as Australian diver Sam Fricker and US rugby player Ilona Maher, who have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers in the past week.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Hutchinson says those athletes are being smart and &#34;strategic&#34; about using TikTok to boost their profile.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They might not win a medal while they&#39;re there, but what they are doing is taking the hype that&#39;s around them at the moment and leveraging that. So it&#39;s kind of a personal investment into the next phases of their career,&#34; he says.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>The Olympic stars on TikTok</h2></p><div data-component="unordered-list-block"><div><div><ul role="list"><li><b>Sam Fricker, 19, Australian diver</b>: 1.1 million followers. Posts up to 10 TikToks a day about athlete life at the Games. Has a chatty, affable style.</li><li><b>Ilona Maher, 24, US Rugby Sevens</b>: 725,000 followers. Known for sassy takes and &#34;thirsty&#34; videos for <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSJG7dLos/">&#34;tall foreign demigod Olympians&#34;</a>. </li><li><b>Tyler Downs, 18, US diver: </b>913,000 followers. One of the first Olympians to go viral over <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tylerdownss/video/6987483523921759494">being starstruck seeing Simone Biles</a>.</li><li><b>Margie Didal, 22, Filipino skateboarder: </b>1.5 million followers. The skating sensation&#39;s <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSJGWgErg/">cheerful charisma</a> made her a standout in front of both TV and phone cameras. </li></ul></div></div></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Knowing the game</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Like any good investment, a considerable amount of effort goes into it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Maher has joked about spending six hours a day on the app, creating Olympic content &#34;so the world can get an inside look&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many athletes also make videos in response to user comments, which on TikTok are almost as important as the clip itself. Users like to read what other people are thinking and athletes get direct feedback.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Sam Fricker / Ilona Maher / TIKTOK</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Sam Fricker and Ilona Maher have become leading TikTok personalities at the Games</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The app rewards athletes who understand its users, and their culture of inside jokes, dances, and memes says Dr Hutchinson.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>These trends change from week to week - but if an athlete can tap into one, their video can go gangbusters.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Take Adam Peaty&#39;s gold medal TikTok for example. He used the Drake song Know Yourself- a track often used on TikTok to represent a moment of significant realisation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In his case, it&#39;s the fact that he&#39;s an Olympic champion.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As one user dryly commented: &#34;Halfway through the race he was like &#39;Damn I have a good idea for a TikTok&#39;&#34;.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Any limits?</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>With the variety of social media apps these days, experts say it&#39;s interesting to characterise their different uses.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Facebook and Instagram are platforms for a winner&#39;s earnest thank-you speech. <a href="https://twitter.com/Simone_Biles/status/1420561448883802118">Twitter has become a press release service </a>for stars like Simone Biles to break news. TikTok is the fun one.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But for each platform, basic protocols apply on what athletes can share. Goofing around is accepted; making a political comment is crossing the line.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The other strict rule? Do not post any sporting action. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s rare to see any clips from the track, field, stadium, pool or velodrome posted on #OlympicTok.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Those rights still belong to the broadcasters and their multi-million dollar contracts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All TikTok can offer is backstage access, which for many viewers is a whole new world.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The traditional model is what it&#39;s always been - you have the key events, the opening ceremony, the heats, the finals - none of that changes. But what we&#39;re seeing now is this behind-the-scenes experience, produced by the athletes themselves,&#34; Dr Hutchinson told the BBC. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s not really a challenge to what we know. In many ways it&#39;s complementary to the traditional media event.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not from a rampaging dragon or a demon army attacking the land of Azeroth, but from some unhappy players who, after 17 years, have had enough.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On YouTube, Reddit and Twitter, there are stories about people leaving the game. Some cite long delays for new content in a game that charges a monthly fee; others are annoyed at a lack of communication.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Players have been flocking to competing games in larger numbers than ever - led by a wave of famous streamers and content creators jumping ship.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Then, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57929543">the allegations of widespread sexual harassment</a> and discrimination at Activision Blizzard came.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As Scott Johnson, host of popular MMO podcast The Instance, put it: &#34;You have the perfect storm for a lot of players to hang up their Azeroth gear for good and stake out for a new place to play.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>&#39;Drastic&#39; dip</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Activision Blizzard has not released official player counts for World of Warcraft (WoW) for years. But it does tell investors how many &#34;monthly active users&#34; all of its games have every quarter.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Those figures show that its games lost two million players in three months. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>New numbers on how many active players it has across its portfolio of games are due out soon, when the firm announces its latest quarterly results.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>WoW is still making plenty of money - revenue is up - so it&#39;s possible those numbers mean some of its other games are suffering rather than WoW.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s impossible to see the real exodus stats,&#34; Scott admitted. &#34;But based on things I have heard inside and outside the company, this might be the most drastic dip they&#39;ve yet experienced.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He doesn&#39;t believe the dissatisfaction is down to any one thing - but that after so many years, players are used to every twist on the core gameplay.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You are still iterating on the same basic systems and I think players are hitting a point of &#39;been there, done that&#39; that might be more widespread than in years past,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And then there&#39;s the competition - offering &#34;similar yet new experiences&#34;.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>&#39;Insane&#39; growth</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Final Fantasy XIV is arguably WoW&#39;s most like-for-like competitor. At launch in 2010, it was famously so bad that the developers &#34;destroyed the world&#34; to rebuild the game from square one - a rags-to-riches redemption story that has since attracted millions of players.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But all of a sudden, it&#39;s seen player numbers surge during what should be a quiet time for the game - its next big expansion is not due for months.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeplaHQ">Zepla, an FFXIV YouTube creator and streamer</a>, said &#34;the last few weeks have been insane.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We usually get a lot of new players when an expansion comes, but this surpasses even that,&#34; she said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The game is so popular that it temporarily stopped selling new copies. Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/8f55217e86331b83783b89dc0d0e9fa8af5e7bb1">issued a heartfelt apology for server issues</a> caused by the &#34;staggering and unexpected&#34; influx of new players.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Square Enix</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>FFXIV applies a different style to things - but is still recognisable</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s not the only MMO suffering from sudden success. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>New World, Amazon&#39;s first attempt in the field, hasn&#39;t even launched yet. But its beta test period saw it overwhelmed with server issues as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/new-world-beta-hits-190000-concurrent-players-on-steam/">it hit nearly 200,000 players joining the game at once</a>. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Zepla was herself once a WoW player - but left years ago for FFXIV during its poorly-received Warlords of Draenor expansion. She thinks many players have been frustrated for years.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Common complaints have included frustration with poor class balance, &#39;out of touch&#39; developers, and needlessly complex, RNG-heavy game systems. Put simply, many players haven&#39;t felt listened to. They&#39;ve not felt their time has been respected. And they are tired.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Popular streamers have fuelled some of this interest. Well-known WoW player Asmongold has been credited with driving many players to both FFXIV and New World in recent weeks. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;So the WoW community had already heard good things about FFXIV,&#34; Zepla said, &#34;and now in light of recent events, they may be searching for a new MMO in earnest.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And then, amid all this, came the sexual harassment scandal that hit the community hard. </p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Virtual picket lines</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scott Johnson has been making WoW content online since 2004. He says he chaired a panel at Blizzard&#39;s annual fan festival in 2018 with one of the people named in the allegations - something he now sees in a new light. As someone who plays an active role in the community, he says he personally knows some of the women who were victims.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Speaking for me, I&#39;ve never felt this level of anger and disappointment in my professional career as I did in the wake of these allegations,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Morale among the the community is &#34;the lowest it&#39;s ever been. Full stop. Blizzard has had its stumbles over the years, but nothing like this.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On Twitter, he posted one of his illustrations - a shattered Hearthstone, the tool WoW players use to return home. It&#39;s been retweeted a thousand times.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He&#39;s not alone in taking a break, at least from Azeroth.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Influential UK streamer Preach is also among those to announce he would no longer cover WoW, describing the sexual harassment allegations as &#34;the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some players are debating a boycott, drawing virtual &#34;picket lines&#34; to not enter Blizzard&#39;s games.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Zepla, for her part, thinks a boycott is justified - but &#34;I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the only way&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some content creators &#34;have chosen to stay in the community as they feel they can use their platforms to amplify the voices of those who are speaking out against injustice,&#34; she explains.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Demanding accountability from within is another way to make a positive difference here.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>These are practical decisions, too - changing games as a creator can be a risky move, with no guarantee your audience will follow.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Like family</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>So is it the end of the world (of Warcraft)?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I&#39;d bet that the game&#39;s best years are well behind it,&#34; Scott says - but he doubts it will vanish.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;While some players will be taking massive breaks, or leaving for good, there are others whose entire social circle is in the game - and leaving it would be like leaving family.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s the end for Azeroth.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It will bleed, be injured, and maybe forever scarred, but I think it will likely live on one way or the other.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When WoW eventually does disappear and its servers are switched off - perhaps many years from now - the impact it had on the industry will live on.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Amid all these troubles, a video from FFXIV director Yoshi-P has been widely shared.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Without World of Warcraft, [FFXIV] would not exist,&#34; he said in the video translated by a fan. &#34;WoW was the game we constantly looked up to.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Saying we won or lost to WoW is off-base to start with, because they were the game we aspired to be.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="compact"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Zoe Kleinman</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>The pandemic has ushered in a new era for tech, from Zooms and pings to e-scooters and online shopping. </b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Back in April 2020, Microsoft&#39;s Brad Smith said two years of digital transformation had taken place in just two months. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So with Covid restrictions easing across England, will any of the innovations stick? </p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Cyber-security </h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, says there has been an &#34;element of desensitisation&#34; as formerly risky online behaviour, like scanning unknown QR codes or clicking on seemingly innocent links in text messages, has become the norm.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This has made people more susceptible to malicious attacks, as Lisa says: &#34;It&#39;s been a good year for hackers.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;re now used to using tech in this haphazard way. We&#39;ve just had the longest time in history where it has been practically mandated.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lisa says she was checking in with the NHS Covid-19 app at a south-west England restaurant recently, and noticed the QR code&#39;s web address wanted to direct her smartphone to a Russian domain, ending .ru.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She alerted the venue, which had no idea how it had got there and removed it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Someone had put that up, maybe for a joke, maybe not - but it was obviously not a genuine site,&#34; she said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;As long as there is uncertainty in an environment, then it&#39;s ripe for attack. We&#39;ve unlocked, but the uncertainty is still there. And so there will still be people exploiting it.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Transport</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Public transport is here to stay - but now with more apps to enable travellers to better plan their journeys, says Prof Jillian Anable, chair of transport and energy at University of Leeds.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She says despite how it may have appeared, there is no data currently pointing to a boom in individual modes of transport like e-scooters, bikes and cars. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There was an increase in cycling during the first England lockdown. When the weather was good, there was less traffic on the roads and people were bored - but it has not significantly sustained itself so far, according to her data.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Generally we found that people who worked from home, mostly didn&#39;t stop using their cars.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Conversely, 60% of people who used buses throughout the pandemic did so because they had no other choice, she said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, as more people look to travel less to work, we may see a bigger shift towards electric cars for smaller, more local journeys, and more households running one car rather than two.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;On average, at least half of travel is for leisure and shopping. In the short term there will probably be more day trips, and staycations, so it is a possibility that the total mileage we do may increase in the next year or two,&#34; she adds.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Gaming</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Analyst George Jijiashvili, from the firm Omdia, says the pandemic-induced video gaming craze is unlikely to be sustained - but it&#39;s definitely not game-over for the industry as people gain more leisure time options.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There will be an initial decline in growth but overall we think the games market will continue to grow, because through this pandemic period a lot of people who got into gaming will continue to enjoy it as a pastime,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>George also predicts that there will be increased demand for handheld games consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the recently-announced Steam Deck from Valve, with commuters wanting to play on their journeys, as more return to workplaces. E-sports fans will be keen to return to stadium-based events once they are back on.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He also thinks the return of physical events like E3 and Gamescom will give the industry a shot in the arm.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This year&#39;s E3 was mediocre,&#34; he says,</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;One of the many things holding back announcements was the lack of an in-person event. They are vital for smaller developers in particular - they use them to find new partners and publishers.&#34;  </p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Zoom boom  </h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS insight, thinks the so-called Zoom boom - the era of video calls - is here to stay.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;For many people, the shift to video communications is now permanent,&#34; he says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;What would have been a phone call is now likely to be a video call and I expect to see this form of communication being used far more widely when people are out and about, not just stuck at home or in a fixed location.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ben also thinks a combination of physical and digital meetings will become the new normal.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He is, however, concerned that the current &#34;pingdemic&#34; - people getting &#34;pinged&#34; by the NHS Covid-19 app because of close contact with a positive case, may make them more wary about using their handsets. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It could reignite the debate about much information mobile phones are able to capture about our daily lives,&#34; he said. </p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The couple plan to buy solar battery storage so that even more of their energy is useable. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While flooding is a concern in the surrounding area, they don&#39;t worry about it - and not just because their house is on an elevation. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Their driveway has gravel that drains water, rather than collecting it into pools, and their green roof reduces rainwater run-off. And under their rear garden is a soakaway: essentially a big tank constructed of crates that collects excess rainwater and gradually drains it into the subsoil. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Flooding in Hereford early this year. Climate change is making floods in the UK more frequent and more severe</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Also, below the surface, are pipes connected to a ground source heat pump. The pump takes heat from the ground and boosts it to the level needed for the underfloor heating and hot water. Heat pumps are much more energy efficient than boilers, which typically rely on fossil fuels. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Heal&#39;s house does have a wood-burning stove as well, but the stove is there mainly because it looks nice, not because it is their main source of heat.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Higher energy needs, more flood risk and variable temperatures: these are among the impacts of climate change for which all of the UK - not only sustainable construction consultants like Mr Heal - needs to be ready.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Yet the UK is ill-prepared, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) has concluded. The CCC, which advises the government on climate change, has issued a stark warning in its latest independent assessment of UK climate risk: the risk is intensifying, but adaptation action has fallen behind. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While there&#39;s been some focus on climate mitigation or limiting greenhouse gas emissions, experts say there&#39;s an equally pressing need for us to adapt to a world with more climatic extremes. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Christine Ro</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Triple-glazed doors in Colin Heal&#39;s environmentally-friendly house</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One key change will be higher temperatures. The CCC warns that a quarter of UK homes are in danger of overheating. People in the UK have tended to focus on making buildings warm, but increasingly more awareness will be needed of how to keep them cool.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Thankfully, some of the best measures are also some of the simplest. The CCC refers to &#34;low-regret&#34; or &#34;no-regret&#34; actions. These include using thick blinds and curtains, closing windows when it&#39;s hotter outside than inside and ensuring proper ventilation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fionnuala Walravens, a campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency, also advocates a common-sense approach to staying cool. &#34;The first kind of approach to sustainable cooling is to ask, &#39;do you actually need cooling?&#39;&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When thoughtful design maximises shade, airflow and ventilation, the answer may be no. Mr Heal&#39;s house has internal blinds on all windows and thick insulation that buffers the house against extreme temperatures. It&#39;s essentially airtight, he says. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>We need to adapt to a world with more climatic extremes, say scientists</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Passive cooling can minimise the need for air conditioning, which takes a huge toll on the environment in the forms of energy gobbled up, excess heat expelled, and damaging hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) emitted. If mechanical cooling is needed, Ms Walravens recommends energy efficient units that use natural refrigerants in place of HFCs (as well as HFC-free heat pumps). </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One obstacle to this kind of future-proofing is lack of information. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Iggy Bassi heads the climate-intelligence company, Cervest, which uses artificial intelligence to provide highly specific information on climate-related risks, right down to the individual property level.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Cervest&#39;s product EarthScan is available in a &#34;freemium&#34; model to small-scale users. This allows people to see, within five-year increments, the intensity, types and interactions of climate risks for a factory, say, or a farm.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We need to get proactive about climate risk,&#34; says Mr Bassi, and having action that people can act upon is essential to that.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Cervest</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Iggy Bassi wants more detailed yet accessible information about climate risk</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Using this kind of climate intelligence, a hotel company can see the risks of putting a tall building close to the coast, for example - with the risk-level changing depending on the building&#39;s height and its proximity to the shore.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Yet, overall, existing guidance on climate-proofing can be confusing or simply inadequate. The new UK Business Climate Hub may help to centralise information for small businesses, but it would be useful to have additional and accessible standards and tools. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Along with insufficient information, costs can be a stumbling block. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Not everyone will be able to design a new-build home with the care, time and expense that Mr Heal did. He estimates that the sustainability considerations led to a 5% higher spend overall.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The CCC is urging the government to provide more information and, especially, more financial support to encourage changes that can be initially pricey but ultimately cost-effective. For example, subsidies can encourage take-up of the most efficient, least polluting types of cooling devices.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Government legislation can drive change - sending the right market signals that could build climate resilience. For instance, Ms Walravens argues, only heat pumps with low greenhouse warming potential (GWP) should be allowed under the government&#39;s Renewable Heat Incentive. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The CCC also says there&#39;s a need to give people incentives to adopt measures like passive-cooling and rainwater harvesting.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Christine Ro</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>If you live somewhere vulnerable to flooding be proactive and consider shifting electrical appliances and additional insurance</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there are still some things that people renting, and those who can&#39;t afford to retro-fit their buildings, can do now. Households at risk of flooding, for example, can move their electrical appliances up higher, and generally create a flood plan and consider flood insurance. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, property owners and building associations may want to move electrical sockets up the wall and opt for tiled rather than carpeted floors. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the community level, natural flood defences can slow and divert the flow of water. Unlike hard barriers these allow for adjustment to sea level rise.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ultimately, Mr Bassi wants a complete change in the way we view and respond to risk. &#34;What mayors should really be saying to themselves is - in the next three years, I only want assets in my city that are climate-proofed.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Heal thinks there should be more financial incentives to encourage climate-proofing: &#34;People are quite reluctant at the moment to invest in sustainability.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That way the benefits he has experienced - from the income derived from surplus energy, to the security of knowing that his home can deal with more extreme weather - could be enjoyed by more homeowners.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead they have to take daily tests.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There had been speculation that the app could be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57772515">made less sensitive</a> to the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the DHSC said the update &#34;does not impact the sensitivity of the app, or change the risk threshold&#34;.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Trust still essential </h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>There was speculation when Sajid Javid became the new health secretary just as the word &#34;pingdemic&#34; was entering the language that he would order changes to make the app less sensitive. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That was ruled out - but it seems Mr Javid asked what else could be done and was advised that the option unveiled on Monday would be wiser. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Cutting the period the app hunts back through the close contacts of an asymptomatic person before a positive test from five days to two could mean a substantial fall in the numbers sent into isolation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There has been huge pressure for change from businesses which have seen their operations disrupted by thousands of pings - but at the same time the team behind the app believes it now has strong evidence that it is working.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government will hope it has found a middle way, reducing the burden on businesses and making it less likely that people will delete the app while still alerting those in most danger of becoming infected with the virus and passing it on. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But, as with so much about this project, this is an experiment in human behaviour because for the app to work, people have to trust it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Announcing the change, Mr Javid said: &#34;We want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring we&#39;re protecting those most at risk from this virus.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said the app was &#34;the simplest, easiest and fastest way to find out whether you have been exposed to the virus,&#34; and it had saved thousands of lives.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said she would &#34;strongly encourage everyone, even those fully vaccinated, to continue using the app&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is unclear how many people will be affected by the tweak.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scientists have estimated the app prevented up to 2,000 cases per day in the three weeks to 21 July when the number of self-isolation alerts - known as &#34;pings&#34; - rose by over 70,000 to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57970603">a new record of 689,313</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And their analysis, which assumed 60% compliance with instructions to self-isolate, suggested another 50,000 Covid cases were prevented by including chains of transmission.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This was estimated to have prevented 1,600 hospitalisations, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Around 40% of the eligible population regularly use the app and around 50% of all reported tests are being inputted, it said, saying usage remains &#34;high&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Labour&#39;s shadow health minister Liz Kendall accused the government of &#34;leaving hundreds of thousands of people forced to self-isolate every day&#34; and quietly changing the app, rather than driving infections down.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Trade union Unite said the change did not go far enough and repeated a call from the automotive and steel sectors for workers to be exempt from self-isolation rules.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the move has been welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association, which said its research found up to 1,000 pubs had been forced to close temporarily due to staff being pinged by the app.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Its chief executive Emma McClarkin said: &#34;On average, each pub forced to temporarily close due to staff being pinged costs £9,500 in lost trade per week and our larger venues much, much more at a critical time in their recovery.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From 16 August, fully vaccinated contacts in England <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57733276">will be exempt from isolation</a> and instead will be advised to take a PCR test. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Those who are not fully vaccinated will still be required to isolate, and it will remain a legal obligation to isolate if you test positive. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>On 7 August, Wales will become the first UK nation to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-58013131">stop asking fully vaccinated adults to self-isolate</a> after close contact with a positive Covid case.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, a further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday, meaning nearly 38.5 million people - or 72.7% of the UK population - are now fully vaccinated.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab. </p></div><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="compact"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Gordon Corera</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>The Israel-based NSO Group says its customers are carefully assessed</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>The allegations that spy software known as Pegasus may have been used to carry out surveillance on journalists, activists - and even perhaps political leaders - highlights that surveillance is now for sale. </b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company behind the tool, NSO Group, has denied the allegations and says its customers are carefully assessed.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But it is another sign that high-end spy techniques, which used to be the exclusive preserve of a few states, are now spreading more widely and challenging the way we think about privacy and security in an online world.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the not-too-distant past, if a security service wanted to find out what you were up to, it took a fair degree of effort. They might get a warrant to wiretap your phone. Or plant a bug in your house. Or send a surveillance team to follow you. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Finding out who your contacts were and how you lived your life would take patience and time.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Now, almost everything they might want to know - what you say, where you have been, who you meet, even what interests you - is all contained in a device we carry all the time. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Your phone can be accessed remotely without anyone even touching it and you never knowing that it&#39;s been turned from your friendly digital assistant into someone else&#39;s spy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The ability to remotely access that phone was once considered something only a few states could do. But high-end espionage and surveillance powers are now in the hands of many other countries and even individuals and small groups. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed the power of US and UK intelligence agencies to tap into global communications in 2013. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Those agencies always maintained that their capabilities were subject to the authorisations and oversight of a democratic country. These authorisations were fairly weak at the time, but have since been strengthened. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His revelations, however, prompted other nations to consider what was possible. Many became eager for the same kinds of capabilities and a select group of companies - most of which have kept a low profile - have increasingly sought to sell it to them.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Israel has always been a first-tier cyber-power with top-end surveillance capabilities. And its companies, like NSO Group, often formed by veterans of the intelligence world, have been among those to commercialise the techniques.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>NSO Group say they only sell their spyware for use against serious criminals and terrorists. But the problem is how you define those categories.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More authoritarian countries frequently claim journalists, dissidents and human rights activists are criminals or a national security threat making them worthy of intrusive surveillance.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And in many of those countries there is limited or no accountability and oversight on how the powerful capabilities are used.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The spread of encryption has increased the drive for governments to get inside people&#39;s devices. When phone calls were the main means of communication, a telecoms company could be ordered to wiretap the conversation (which once meant literally attaching wires to the line). </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But now the conversations are often encrypted, meaning you need to get to the device itself to see what was said. And devices also carry out a much richer treasure trove of data.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the issues are wider than this kind of phone spyware. Other high-end intelligence capabilities are also spreading fast.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Even the tools to disrupt a business online are now easily accessible.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the past, ransomware - in which hackers demand a payment to unlock access to your system - was the province of criminal networks. It is now sold as as a service on the dark web. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>An individual can simply agree a deal to give them a cut of the profits and they will hand over the tools and even offer support and advice, including helplines in the case of problems.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other techniques - like location tracking and developing profiles of people&#39;s activity and behaviour - which once required specialised access and authority are now available freely.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And when it comes to surveillance, it is not just about states. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is also about what companies can do to track us - not necessarily by implanting spyware, but through a surveillance economy in which they watch what we like on social media to better market us to companies.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All of this creates pools of data that companies can use - but which hackers can steal and states can seek to tap into.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some capabilities are now on sale to everyone. Other types of spyware are for sale to the nervous or suspicious who want to check on their family&#39;s whereabouts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>What all of this means, then, is that we may be stepping into a world in which we can all become spies - but can equally all be spied on.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div><div></div></div><figcaption><span>media caption</span>What’s it like to have spyware on your phone?</figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The post-mortem examination estimated she had been left there for around six weeks, and that she had been murdered. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Six different types of rope had been used</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The police had very few clues to go on. She had been tied up with six different types of rope. Her remains were so decomposed it would be hard even for a close relative to identify her. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lieutenant Mike Hall, the McDonald County deputy sheriff, worked the case for 14 years without getting close to finding out who Grace was - let alone who had killed her. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;If I&#39;m driving around, out on patrol, my mind would sometimes wander. I&#39;d think about who brought her out here? It&#39;s always on my mind,&#34; he says. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As the years went on Grace&#39;s case became colder and colder. Her remains were kept in a cupboard in the sheriff&#39;s office, almost forgotten, just one of America&#39;s estimated 250,000 unsolved murders.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Cold cases, DNA and the Golden State Killer</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>DNA has been used in forensics since the mid-1980s. Traditional techniques are good at matching genetic material to a suspect if DNA for the person in question is already in a police database, but this has its limits.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For example, in the 1970s and 1980s California was gripped by a prolific serial killer and rapist dubbed the Golden State Killer.  Police had his genetic material, but there wasn&#39;t a match in the FBI&#39;s DNA database. Many thought he&#39;d never be found. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But in 2018, authorities decided to use an innovative technique that had burst on to the scene - one that marries the use of DNA with information from ancestry websites that could be used to draw family trees. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Genealogy websites are designed to allow people to find long-lost relatives. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A user puts a DNA swab into the post, and is later given a list of people with whom they share genes and an analysis of how closely they are shared. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The police realised that if they put the murderer&#39;s DNA into an ancestry website, they&#39;d get a list of the killer&#39;s relatives - a crucial clue.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Most genealogy websites don&#39;t allow law enforcement checks, but a few do. Authorities in the Golden State Killer case used a company called GEDmatch.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The Golden State Killer is almost the halo case for the success of the technology,&#34; says GEDmatch CEO Brett Williams.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Once genetic relatives were found, family trees could be built. The trees eventually came together at a point that allowed authorities to zero in on one person - a suspect. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 2020, Joseph DeAngelo, a former California police officer, was sentenced to life in prison.</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Finding &#39;Grace&#39;</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Othram, a Houston-based tech company, was founded shortly after the DeAngelo breakthrough with a goal to solve unsolvable cases using the new technology. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The company uses data sources like those provided by GEDMatch, and has helped law enforcement crack <a href="https://dnasolves.com/articles/?article_status=SOLVED">a series of high-profile murders and missing people cases</a> in the last two years. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In November 2020, Othram took on Grace&#39;s case.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It went through the same process that the police had gone through with the Golden State Killer. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Shawna&#39;s DNA was degraded and had bacterial contamination. Othram cleaned up Grace&#39;s DNA, creating a genetic profile that could then be run through several genealogy websites. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From there, they found a number of third cousin matches and started building up a family tree to find a common ancestor. Working down the family tree, they began to develop a theory about who she might have been related to and gave the names to Lt Hall. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Based on Graces&#39; skull, a forensic artist drew up a picture of what she might have looked like</figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>The call</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The call from the lieutenant came when Danielle was at work. At first she thought it was a scam - something about a murder, a possible sister, a DNA test. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But after speaking to her family, she called the number back.  The gravity of what Lt Hall was telling her began to sink in. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When I called him back I was bawling and crying,&#34; she says. &#34;He was telling me all this stuff and I was like, &#39;how did you get hold of me? How do you know who I am? Or that I&#39;m related?&#39; I just freaked out.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lt Hall eventually convinced Danielle to take a DNA test.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On 29 March the result came back. Grace Doe was her sister, Shawna. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I just started crying,&#34; she says. </p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Questions of ethics</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Shawna&#39;s case, and many others like hers, shows that the process works. But it also has its critics. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The main issue of contention is privacy. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The technique is so sensitive that one person&#39;s DNA could be enough to identify hundreds or even thousands of their genetic relatives - none of whom have consented to law enforcement checks. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In effect, one person can sign up their entire extended family. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;re not talking about searching in databases for the people who voluntarily submit their information,&#34; says Erin Murphy, author of Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;re talking about searching in a database to find the thousands of people that don&#39;t even know they&#39;re related to that individual.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Danielle was found because a distant relative had consented to their DNA being used for law enforcement checks - not because she had. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Brett Williams of GEDmatch accepts the ethical dilemma of using the technology. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You have two competing priorities here. The first priority is you have an absolute right to privacy. But on the same token, you have a competing priority, which is we have a right to not get murdered.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the desire for families to find out identifies of loved ones - or the killer of a relative - doesn&#39;t trump privacy concerns, argues Murphy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s incredibly hard to say this, but we don&#39;t make policies about the civil liberties of our whole society, based on the personal feelings of single victims,&#34; she says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This is the main reason why so many genealogy websites don&#39;t allow law enforcement checks - including Ancestry.com and 23AndMe. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rob is adamant that without the process they would never have found out what had happened to their sister.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;My sister has been sitting on a shelf for 30 years. She won&#39;t be anymore.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Some kind of closure</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rob and Danielle still don&#39;t have a picture of Shawna as an adult. They still aren&#39;t sure what name she was using at the time of her death. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The police are trying to work out what Shawna&#39;s movements were before she died, or anyone that knew her as an adult. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They believe she may have been based in Joplin, Missouri, at the time of her disappearance.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lt Hall thinks he has a real chance of breaking the case. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I do think the murder can be solved now that we know who she is,&#34; he says.  </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Rob and Danielle at the funeral</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Shawna&#39;s funeral was bittersweet for Rob and Danielle. They finally knew who and where their sister was. She had not been refusing contact. She hadn&#39;t emigrated. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But it&#39;s not the ending they&#39;d prayed for. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I have nightmares. I hear screams,&#34; says Danielle, who can&#39;t help reading the local press stories about the case. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I read about her every day, I have to. It&#39;s horrifying because I cry every time I read it. But somehow I feel closer to her when I&#39;m reading it.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Shawna&#39;s identification is a huge break in the case. Up and down the United States similar breakthroughs are happening weekly. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s no understatement to describe this technique as a revolution in solving cold case murders. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, this method is so new there are very few laws governing its use. And with privacy an increasingly controversial issue in the US, politicians will have to decide to what extent they want genealogy websites used to fight crime. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The police believe there is a very real prospect that Shawna&#39;s killer is still alive, and assumed they&#39;d gotten away with it. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Technology means that one day the person, and many other murderers in the US, may be brought to justice.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Watch Our World this weekend on the BBC News Channel and BBC World News to learn more on the technology behind the story.</i></p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But as soon as it was cracked open, it was very, very cool.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The fungus had eaten its way through the plastic sponge intended to seal it in, breaking it down and assimilating it like any other food. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The aim of the project was to evaluate a number of strains of fungus for use in bio-based insulation panels, but the hungry fungus has taken them in another direction.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Biohm is now working to develop the strain to make it an even more efficient digester that could potentially help get rid of plastic waste.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Biohm</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Under the microscope it is possible to see the bacteria digesting the plastic</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s no secret that single-use plastic waste is a vast problem: by 2015, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Trashed-Greenpeace-plastics-report-final.pdf">according to Greenpeace</a>, the world had churned out 6.3 billion tonnes of virgin plastic, of which only 9% has been recycled. The rest was burned in incinerators or dumped.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Things are improving, with more than 40% of plastic packaging now recycled in the EU, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/packaging-waste_en">and a target of 50% by 2025</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But some types of plastic, such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) which is widely used for drinks bottles, are hard to recycle by traditional means. So might biological methods be the answer?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Jenkins is testing their fungus on PET and polyurethane.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You put in plastic, the fungi eat the plastic, the fungi make more fungi and then from that you can make biomaterials... for food, or feed stocks for animals, or antibiotics.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Others have also had some success.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>A tweaked version of the E. coli bacteria can transform plastic into a useful flavouring</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scientists from the University of Edinburgh have recently used a lab-engineered version of the bacteria E. coli to transform terephthalic acid, a molecule derived from PET, into the culinary flavouring vanillin, via a series of chemical reactions.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Our study is still at a very early stage, and we need to do more to find ways to make the process more efficient and economically viable,&#34; says Dr Joanna Sadler, of the university&#39;s School of Biological Sciences.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;But it&#39;s a really exciting starting point, and there&#39;s potential for this to be commercially practical in the future after further improvements to the process have been made.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, a team at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig is using a bacterium originally found in a local rubbish dump to break down polyurethane.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Called Pseudomonas sp. TDA1, the bacterium consumes around half the plastic to increase its own biomass, with the rest released as carbon dioxide.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Like other plastic-eating organisms, Pseudomonas breaks down the polyurethane using enzymes; and the team has now carried out a genomic analysis of the bacterium with the aim of identifying the particular genes that code for these enzymes. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But some question whether such techniques will ever be commercially viable.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Enzyme or microbial conversion of PET to its constituent building blocks is interesting science and needs to be explored. However, the technology will have to compete with proven, commercial conversion technologies using mundane, less exciting water-catalyst systems,&#34; says Prof Ramani Narayan of Michigan State University. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Carbios</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Carbios uses enzymes to break down PET</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Furthest down the road to commercialisation is probably Carbios, a French company using an engineered version of an enzyme originally found in a compost heap to break down PET.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After teaming up with some big names in consumer products, including L&#39;Oreal and Nestle, the company recently announced that it has produced the world&#39;s first food-grade PET plastic bottles produced entirely from enzymatically recycled plastic.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And unlike most recycling methods, the enzymes can deal with coloured PET.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;With traditional methods such as mechanical recycling, to make a end-product suitable for transparent bottles, you need transparent bottles as an input,&#34; says deputy chief executive Martin Stephan.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;With our technology, any kind of PET waste is recycled into any kind of PET product.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Carbios</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Carbios says its tech can transform waste into any kind of PET product</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the bottles produced by this process are almost twice as expensive as those that use petrochemicals. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nevertheless, Mr Stephan says the technology has the potential to match the low costs of traditionally made bottles.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Wolfgang Zimmermann of Leipzig University&#39;s Institute of Analytical Chemistry, believes that Carbios&#39;s technique shows promise.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Enzymes may be very useful because they are very specific, and also they don&#39;t care about contamination, if the packaging is still dirty. And they don&#39;t use a lot of energy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The other thing is that it can be scaled up and down conveniently. Enzymes would have the advantage that they can consist of small units that would have a low carbon footprint, and they could be outside metropolitan areas in developing countries or remote places.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he believes they are no panacea.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>PET is hard to recycle and is often sent to developing nations for processing</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;PET bottles can be recycled using this enzyme back to new bottles, but unfortunately PET bottles are very crystalline and very resistant to enzyme degradation, so the company had to introduce an extra pre-treatment where they actually put in a lot of extra energy to melt the material and extrude it to reduce the crystallisation,&#34; he says. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;After that, you can degrade it with the enzyme - but economically, and also in terms of carbon footprint, this doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense in my opinion.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And while things may improve, enzymatic recycling currently has a very limited range, as Mr Stephan concedes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We have developed technologies for the end-of-life of two polyesters only, representing around 75 million tonnes of annual production, compared to a global plastics production of around 350 million tonnes,&#34; he says. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;A lot of work is ahead of us.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root"><div><main id="main-content" data-testid="main-content"><div><div width="wide"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Sean Coughlan</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>BBC/Ceri Oakes</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>It was three in the morning when Sam Lancaster found her family&#39;s new Yorkshire home by the sea. </b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know what brought Scarborough into my head. I just googled it,&#34; she says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was house-love at first sight. But there was another key piece of information. Her husband Craig had been told by his employer, a major telecoms firm, that he could work - indefinitely - from home. Meetings with colleagues would take place virtually in future. Sam and Craig suddenly realised that they and their two daughters could live anywhere - including the seaside. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Lancasters say they had &#34;outgrown&#34; their home in Thatcham, Berkshire, not far from Craig&#39;s office in Newbury. No longer constrained by the geography of a daily commute, they started looking for better value houses in other parts of the country. Now, they&#39;re unpacking boxes in a big, rambling home on the North Yorkshire coast, with the sea a blue horizon out the back window.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And in this week&#39;s picture-postcard sunshine, they have been swimming in the sea most days.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s a no-brainer. It feels so right,&#34; says 41-year-old Sam, convinced her family&#39;s migration 230 miles north, as the gull flies, is going to be part of a bigger trend. &#34;If you can work from home, why wouldn&#39;t you move?&#34; she says, swatting away any doubts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Craig, whose IT job supports network operations, says a trip to Screwfix turned into a nature trek. &#34;We saw seals swimming in the sea and puffins. You wouldn&#39;t see that in Thatcham.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Just look out the window. There are lovely walks, people have been welcoming, the girls can go down to the beach,&#34; says Sam. She&#39;s in a mover&#39;s honeymoon where everything still feels like a holiday, even though she says some of the locals are more likely to &#34;slag off the town&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some of their old friends also thought they were crazy for uprooting. Sam says they quietly asked her whether she thought it was a rash decision.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there was another piece of rocket fuel for this life change. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The awfulness of the pandemic made her think there was no point in hesitating. She had &#34;gone off&#34; their old area. Here was a chance to reinvent their lives. &#34;I would never have done this without the pandemic,&#34; she says. She worked as a teaching assistant before and might return to that later. But nothing was going to hold her back.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It will mean new schools for Sophie aged 15, and Olivia, eight, and making new friends for parents and children. But they seem unfazed and confident about a fresh start. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Life is so short,&#34; says Sam.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Lancasters could be part of a changing tide. The big beaches and widescreen skies have always made seaside towns seductive, but they can be slow to reach. Coastal transport can have more dodgy links than a crazy golf course. Will remote working make the coast a practical option? Will people start moving to Zoomtown-on-Sea? And could this revitalise fading seaside towns?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Figures up to June 2021 from the Rightmove property network showed a 115% increase in enquiries about moving from cities to a seaside town, compared with before the pandemic.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>BBC/Ceri Oakes</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>These are people viewing properties and getting information, not completing sales. But Tim Bannister, director of property data, says: &#34;It&#39;s a really strong indicator, a window into what&#39;s happening.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There has also been a shift from most city dwellers looking to move. Before the pandemic they were looking for properties in the same city. Now, most are looking elsewhere. It&#39;s an out-of-city trend that applies to London, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. The rise of hybrid working is a big factor, according to estate agents. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;People are reassessing their lives,&#34; says Phil Fletcher, of CPH estate agents in Scarborough. He also wants the town to reassess its relationship with seagulls, which have just caused a leak in his ceiling.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He says people who have had tough experiences in the pandemic are now making big choices about their relationships, their jobs and where they live. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;People are sitting up and thinking: &#39;Live for the day.&#39;&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Coastal towns, like sea views, are always changing. Where his estate agency now stands was the site of the Theatre Royal, when Scarborough was an entertainment capital. The idea of remote workers moving to cheaper, characterful Victorian houses in Scarborough is not future-gazing for him: &#34;I can see it already happening.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But seaside towns can have a Jekyll and Hyde character. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On a sunny day Scarborough looks irresistible. Families are outside ice-cream coloured chalets, one with a placard saying: &#34;Be Nice or Go Home.&#34; Boats are running trips to see dolphins off the coast. Holidaymakers are shielding their chips from dive-bombing seagulls.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s not just the memorial plaques on seafront benches that prove how much people love to sit and look at the sea. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Environmental psychologist Michelle Tester-Jones, at the University of Exeter, is part of a research project which has found &#34;consistent evidence that spending time near &#39;blue spaces&#39; seems to be good for well-being&#34;, including helping with &#34;anxiety and low mood&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>BBC/Ceri Oakes</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But take a short walk from Scarborough&#39;s seafront and there are boarded up shops on the High Street, like teeth missing in a smile. The Christmas bargain store is still promising presents in July. A food bank collection point stands in the locked-up entrance to Debenhams. The town has immense natural beauty and handsome old buildings, but deprivation - in income, health and education - runs through Scarborough like a stick of rock. It&#39;s a low-income economy with many jobs relying on summer tourism. Male life expectancy has been going into reverse.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s a town of two cities - of bizarre contrasts,&#34; says Andrew Clay, director of Scarborough Museums Trust. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We have wealth and successful businesses,&#34; with a legacy of great architecture and spectacular views, he says. &#34;But some of the areas here are some of the UK&#39;s most depressed - in terms of social deprivation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, hard-to-reach communities. There&#39;s an issue with aspiration in the town,&#34; he says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This mix of light and shade has always been there, perhaps. Mr Clay is speaking in a wood-panelled room in what was once the home of the aristocratic Sitwell family. Edward VII stayed a couple of doors down, when Scarborough was a royal playground. Until he caught typhoid.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The wheel will turn again, and Scarborough will find new ways to appeal to a wider and wealthier range of people, says Mr Clay. That&#39;s if it upgrades its facilities, like getting a multiplex cinema and making better use of its cultural heritage.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s a town that has always reinvented itself,&#34; he says.</p></div><div data-component="include-block"><div data-component="include-html">

Posters of Scarborough from the 1920s and 1930s show glamorous couples in sleek cars and speed boats, with the bays and sandy beaches looking like the south of France. What you see depends on your perspective. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Liz Colling, Scarborough&#39;s councillor in charge of inclusive growth, wants the town&#39;s next reinvention to be about revitalising the local economy, including encouraging more digital jobs. It&#39;s a &#34;very realistic ambition&#34; which is already beginning to happen, she says. &#34;I have a nephew who has just started a job remotely. He would never have applied before because it&#39;s based in London,&#34; says Cllr Colling, adding that her son is also working remotely.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Historically our younger people have left town to pursue education and jobs, but this is a sign that you can still stay here and have a really good career,&#34; she says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Local digital marketing firm, Digital Zest, has had a boom time during the lockdown, with so much going online. Managing director Paul Taylor expects more people to come and work remotely, because of the quality of life and being able to go straight from desk to beach. But even the digital world needs to travel - and he wants improvements to road and transport connections.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>How Scarborough appealed to upmarket tourists in 1930</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scarborough, one of the &#34;left-behind towns&#34;, is getting more than £20m &#34;levelling-up&#34; funding. But it raises the question of what such labels mean, because the town has little of the graffiti, grime or street-begging in a &#34;richer&#34; place such as London. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The real difference is in the jobs market - and it&#39;s why the arrival of Zoom workers is significant. It&#39;s a town with very few professional jobs. It has half the average for the Yorkshire and Humber region, and below a third of a resort such as Brighton. For civil service jobs, Scarborough has only a fifth of the national average.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It also struggles to attract people to stay in such professional jobs - for instance the town has been blighted with problems in recruiting NHS dentists. Parents have had to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57908387">take their children to other towns to find a dentist</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Timo Hannay, a data analyst who has <a href="https://www.schooldash.com/blog-2107.html#20210722">researched the struggles of coastal communities</a> and who advises policymakers, says Scarborough has many of the problems typical of seaside towns - but to a slightly greater degree. We&#39;ll keep being fascinated by these towns, he says, because the seaside carries such a strong sense of Britain&#39;s changing identity - both in its &#34;self-assurance and self-doubt&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>What can get overlooked about Zoom-working is the long-term change for remote workers themselves. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Craig Lancaster is 52. He could spend the rest of his working life alone at home with his multiple computer screens. &#34;I do miss the interaction, that&#39;s the one thing work-wise. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as personable as being in the office face-to-face,&#34; he says. No-one else at home will want to obsess about office politics, there are no workmates to meet over coffee.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But for Craig, the positives of a better work-life balance outweigh any drawbacks.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>BBC/Ceri Oakes</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Work is changing. Productivity has gone up with people working from home. Businesses have realised that trusting their employees means they&#39;re saving money, they&#39;re not having to pay for buildings.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Seaside towns have often been defined by what they used to be. In Scarborough you can almost hear the ghosts of old comedians and imagine the big summer crowds filling huge Victorian hotels, which have become cliff faces for nesting seagulls.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Could it be that the unexpected opportunities afforded by the pandemic will see flocks of a different sort descend on the town?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a series of special reports BBC News has been looking at the challenges and opportunities in seaside towns such as Scarborough.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>Photography by Ceri Oakes</i></p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="compact"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Chris Baraniuk</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Firms are better there&#39;s money to be made by improving video meetings</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>On most video conference calls, only one person gets to speak at a time. It&#39;s a deliberate, designed feature of platforms such as Zoom.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But as Susan D Blum&#39;s linguistic anthropology class found out, it makes having a natural conversation practically impossible.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We always read transcripts out loud,&#34; she says, referring to her students at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. The class exercise involves reading different parts of a dialogue together, exactly as they were spoken. That means overlapping at the end of some sentences, just like in casual conversation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The problem is that Zoom, and other tools like it, <a href="https://devforum.zoom.us/t/suppressed-audio-problem-for-group-meetings/37293">only amplify one speaker&#39;s voice at a time</a> - a deliberate feature of these platforms. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You literally cannot have this kind of conversational overlap,&#34; says Prof Blum. &#34;[The transcript readings] never worked at all.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Lionel Jensen</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Video calls fall short for Professor Susan D Blum</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many people trying to have real conversations remotely have also found that chatter just didn&#39;t flow as smoothly as it does in face-to-face discussions.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Remote working <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54413214">will likely remain in place for some time</a>, at least to some extent. So, will the technology that facilitates working from home improve?</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A spokeswoman for Zoom says the platform uses various innovations to help meetings flow well, including noise suppression technology that removes background sounds, such as typing and paper rustling, or even dogs barking, to improve the audio.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there are all sorts of other niggles with work-related virtual gatherings. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sometimes people have mishaps on camera, connection issues cause disruption, and participants&#39; body language may be difficult, or impossible, to read.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.ifow.org/publications/spotlight-on-remote-workers">Research from the Institute for the Future of Work</a> (IFOW) suggests that meeting via video has had benefits as well as downsides. On the one hand, sometimes workers have found it easier to keep track of, and join, meetings ad hoc.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On the other hand, video calls have sometimes made employees feel uncomfortable, especially those who are new to the company.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This is not always as conducive to learning and training of younger members who aren&#39;t as confident to speak-up,&#34; says Abby Gilbert, principal researcher at IFOW. It means that good management and interpersonal skills are even more important for video meetings, she adds.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Technology can&#39;t replace those things but perhaps it can level the virtual playing field a bit. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The problem cited by Prof Blum, of unnatural audio, is one targeted by the app, High Fidelity, for instance. The app allows all participants on a call to speak at once and the software positions each speaker at a specific point along the stereo spectrum, from left to right.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The net effect is that the app can make it sound a bit like everyone is in the same room, it is most discernible when using headphones.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Another company that hopes to address the problems with online meetings is Headroom. Its platform, not yet publicly available, layers video calls with a suite of features intended to help participants read one another better.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the software monitor people&#39;s faces and body language while they are on the call. The aim is to automatically alert the current speaker to gestures such as a raised hand (which suggests that someone would like to comment).</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Headroom</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Headroom is training AI to understand body language during meetings</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The system can also quantify the &#34;airtime&#34; used by each participant, revealing who is dominating and who is hanging back, for instance. And speakers will even receive information about how engaged their audience is. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To do this, Headroom intends to constantly analyse the facial expressions of listeners on the call, among other things.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In-person meetings are, generally, much smoother than those online, says co-founder and chief executive, Julian Green.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You can tell when people are with you because they&#39;re leaning in or nodding, or they&#39;re sort of in sync with you,&#34; he says. And you may find it easier to judge when to let someone else speak as a result of these subtle cues. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Emotion-detecting AI though is a controversial field because some previous systems have proved inaccurate, for example, or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50761116">biased when reading the faces of non-white people</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Green&#39;s fellow co-founder and chief technology officer Andrew Rabinovich acknowledges that building emotion-detecting AI is difficult but he argues that using multiple data sources - what people are typing as well as their facial expressions, for instance - can improve the overall accuracy of the system. This, the pair suggest, can give a broad sense of how engaged the audience is.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, even such broad tracking will raise concerns about systems that monitor workers, which some call workplace surveillance.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Workplace surveillance has become more commonplace thanks to advances in technology and a rise in people working from home during the pandemic, according to a blog published last year by Dan Lucy at the Institute for Employment Studies.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It also provides fertile ground for organisations and HR professionals to make poor decisions, damaging their reputation as an employer and place of work,&#34; he writes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Another firm planning to launch emotion-detecting technology for meetings is Docket, which offers a range of tools to help workers plan agendas and take notes during video meetings. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Docket</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>Video software that can detect user emotions is the future says Heather Hansson from Docket</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;That, we definitely believe, is going to be key to making that virtual meeting experience even more well rounded,&#34; says director of product Heather Hansson. </p></div><p data-component="crosshead-block"><h2>Will our meetings look more like video games?</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sharpening the productivity of meetings might be desirable. But it raises a question - just how well-oiled do we want all of our personal interactions with colleagues to be? </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Many people working from home during the pandemic have missed informal chats and the casual office milieu. It&#39;s hard to replicate that in a video meeting.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there could be another way. Video game-like platforms that allow employees to hang out online offer an opportunity for impromptu interactions. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gather Town allows colleagues to spend time with one another &#34;like you would in real life&#34;. In this case, that means socialising in a 2-D game world where your avatar can walk around and choose to meet specific colleagues - simultaneously via video chat - in small groups, rather than getting lumped in with everyone at once.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span><span>image source</span>Enter Agora</span></p><figcaption><span>image caption</span>The creators of Enter Agora says it can foster togetherness in a company</figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Then there is Enter Agora. It offers a 3-D virtual space that people can explore, mingle in, and attend more formal events such as meetings and presentations.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Chief executive Ruxandra Radulescu says that five clients, including a major law firm and a construction company are currently using the software. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The construction company, for instance, asked for specific locations from their headquarters to be replicated digitally in Enter Agora.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You can have conversations with your colleagues as they land in the environment - the incidental conversations that you don&#39;t get to have otherwise,&#34; says Ms Radulescu.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>I express some scepticism that people will want to spend much time in a video game version of their workplace. She says that, for quick meetings, a phone call or video chat may be preferable.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, she also argues that Enter Agora can allow employees to feel a greater sense of togetherness when they are not able to travel to an event or office. Reducing the number of flights business people take could have environmental benefits, too.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Radulescu asserts that people in the future will think it strange that such platforms weren&#39;t always an option.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I see it 10 years from now… &#39;Do you remember when this happened? Wow, we used to have conversations in Zoom&#39;,&#34; she says.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It helps farmers map their acreage and make the most efficient use of their land. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The technology is &#34;in demand across the globe&#34; and has become the &#34;rural thieves&#39; top target&#34;, the insurer said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Without GPS... harvests can be delayed and farmers are left unable to work,&#34; said Rebecca Davidson, rural affairs specialist with NFU Mutual.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Det Con Chris Piggott, from the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, said: &#34;The pattern we are increasingly seeing is of gangs who patiently watch farms from a distance to discover where expensive tractor GPS kit is stored.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They generally return at night to steal, and are now using silent electric scooters to get into farmyards undetected and make off at high speed.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He added: &#34;Thieves are also becoming even slicker stealing quad bikes - watching for hours to rush into farm yards and steal them when they are left unattended for a few minutes.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The total cost of the insurer&#39;s claims for the theft of GPS, quad bikes and other all-terrain vehicles amounted to more than £9m last year, a drop of only 2% on 2019.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>NFU Mutual&#39;s <a href="https://www.nfumutual.co.uk/globalassets/farming/rural-crime/2021/rural-crime-report-2021.pdf">annual rural crime report</a> says the overall cost of theft in the UK countryside fell in 2020 because of the lockdown, the existence of more police rural crime teams, and increased farm security.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Wales and Northern Ireland both saw the largest falls, down 39.4% and 36.9% respectively, while Scotland saw a 25% decrease.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In regions of England the level of the falls in theft claims varied - ranging from a 9.7% dip in the North East to a 25.3% decrease in the Midlands. The only area to see a rise was the North West, where the cost of claims were up 3.3%.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The thefts of livestock was down by about a quarter.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the value of sheep and cattle attacked by dogs rose in 2020 following a surge in pet ownership during the pandemic and visits to the countryside, NFU Mutual said.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other trends highlighted by NFU Mutual included fly-tipping in fields and country lanes, which was said to have reached &#34;epidemic proportions&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meanwhile, cybercrime affecting farmers is said to be a growing danger, with phishing emails about farm payments and scam adverts for agricultural machinery.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>NFU Mutual, which insures about three-quarters of all UK farmers, says it is investing £430,000 in rural security schemes in 2021.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section><section data-component="see-alsos"><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
